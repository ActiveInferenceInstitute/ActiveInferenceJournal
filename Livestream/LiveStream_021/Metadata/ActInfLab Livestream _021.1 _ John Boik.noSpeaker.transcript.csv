"Unknown","00;00;08;03","00;00;50;10","Hello and welcome everyone to Active Lab. This is active live stream number 21.1 and we're here with John Blake and several other colleagues looking forward to a discussion today on this science driven societal transformation series and project that we've been exploring and had several background sessions 01 through .04 with John and in the discussion today and next week we're going to be looking to draw out some threads and include some new perspectives and hear from the questions that people may have."
"Unknown","00;00;51;02","00;01;13;12","And for these discussions, we're going to be using the same Jamba words that we were using for the discussions with just John and I, and we're going to jump around the Jamba words. We're going to hear questions from anyone who wants to ask live or in the YouTube chat, and we'll have fun. So we'll just start with introductions and then get a quick little recap and off we go."
"Unknown","00;01;13;26","00;01;49;18","So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California, and I'll pass it first to Alex thanks. Hi, everyone. I'm Alex. I'm a researcher in Systems Management School in Moscow, Russia. And I said to Steven, Thank you. Hi, I'm Steven, based in Toronto. I do a lot of work with participatory theater and community development and I'm researching how social topographies can be used across scales of community psychology and other development practices."
"Unknown","00;01;50;04","00;02;17;16","And I'm going to pass it over to Lee. Thanks, Steven. On Lee on the researcher based at the University of York. And I'm studying systems transformation. My supervisor is is Gavin Stacey, who I think you've drawn a little bit, John, in that company's statements. That was really, really happy to find someone who was looking at systems transformation and an act of inference at the same time."
"Unknown","00;02;18;00","00;02;37;13","Although I think you're a lot further down the line than I am in thinking about this. I really looked forward to this session. Cool. Well, welcome, John. Maybe you could give an introduction and start things off. Sure. Thanks. For having me. And thanks, everybody, for joining us. My name is John Blake. I'm a courtesy faculty at Oregon State University."
"Unknown","00;02;37;15","00;03;03;06","And the purpose of these talks is to discuss the series of papers that are just recently published in the journal Sustainability The title is Science Driven Societal Transformation Parts One, two and three. And if you would go, we're going to do a quick recap of some of the material that we've just discussed before. We'll jump around a little bit just to catch some main highlights."
"Unknown","00;03;03;29","00;03;25;12","And, of course, feel free to jump in with any questions as we go So if you could turn to Gemba one slide one. Yep. You got it. OK, good. So this just is the pictures of the different papers. The links are down in the lower left. So in case anyone wants to check out the papers, please do the role."
"Unknown","00;03;25;12","00;03;58;03","Open source, frequent free available And we're going to focus today. We'll jump around a little bit and capture the main, main topics. But we're going to focus on part three design today. All right. Slide two, please. And as as we go through this, if there's more questions, if someone wants more materials, all of the links are available, all the links, all the papers and some other materials are available at my website for this project."
"Unknown","00;03;58;03","00;04;51;18","Principal Societies Project Board. And I might mention, there's also a interactive model there that you can lead a framework which we'll talk about. So you can see how the economic simulation goes. Slide five or slide four. Excuse me. Yes. So what is the what is the purpose of this? What is the what is the problem that is the series is trying to solve the problem that faces society or a really human civilization is a host of very large so far, intractable problems, including climate change, biodiversity loss, poverty, income and wealth inequality and a, you know, soil and soil depletion, groundwater depletion, pollution."
"Unknown","00;04;51;19","00;05;34;05","I mean, it's a long list of very serious problems. That we face so serious, in fact, that it's not clear at this point how civilization will fare in the coming decades, even in the coming years. I mean, the world is armed right now. The world is armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons. So, you know, any moment things could go awry or or things could just deteriorate rapidly as climate change and biodiversity loss gain speed So hopefully we will solve our problems, hopefully as societies and hopefully we will improve quality of life and quality of the environment."
"Unknown","00;05;35;07","00;06;05;24","But that is the that is what we're shooting for in the series is the pathways to do just that. I would like to point out that this series is focused on transformation in the sense of de novo design of fundamentally new systems societal systems, which I talk about six, I believe. So economic systems, legal systems, financial systems, governance systems, things like that."
"Unknown","00;06;07;15","00;06;42;06","So the the the problem is the major constellation of problems that we face globally. And the proposed solution solution is to view society as a cognitive organism. And just like any organism, it has an intrinsic purpose of maintaining achievement and maintaining vitality. So how does it do that? How does any organism survived it learns it to it develops, it learns, it affects, it learns from its actions and it and it adapts to new conditions as necessary."
"Unknown","00;06;44;08","00;07;28;29","This series is actually an R&D proposal. It's it's aimed at the the the global scientific body. And my hope is to interest the scientific world in this in this problem. Of how do you transform, how how could we build a better society? What if we were to if we were to create any conceivable way to organize society, any conceivable economic systems or governance systems or legal systems, educational systems, what would be the best in terms of quality of life and quality of the environment and long term sustainability?"
"Unknown","00;07;30;07","00;07;59;26","I think that's a question that science is now capable of addressing. Perhaps this is the first time in history that science had the tools and the skill and the background and the and the computational power to address these kinds of very, very large questions. But I think that we can do it now. The whole R&D program is is is is described as a as a partnership between the global scientific community and local communities."
"Unknown","00;07;59;26","00;08;27;12","So the idea here is to test and to build, create and test new systems at the local level and in cooperation with local volunteer communities. And and I and I talk about implementing those systems and implementing field tests via a cloud model, which we'll discuss a little bit more. OK, so that's a very quick overview. Maybe onto slide five."
"Unknown","00;08;27;23","00;09;01;00","But first, Steven, with a question and then anyone else who is raising their hands. Sure. Just keep together hands. Yeah, go ahead, Steven. Thank you. Yeah, I just one question. I unless you mentioned them architecture, so you've got the idea of architecture and you've got these different things that we have got in the Constellation and I wonder if you could speak a little bit more to the idea of architecture and how that relates to architectures in the brain or maybe distributed systems of the brain, you know?"
"Unknown","00;09;01;14","00;09;32;20","You know, the brain is what I'm thinking of when I use the word architecture. Well, a little bit. I mean, people talk about computing frameworks and computing architectures too. But I really had in mind the way the brain functions and maybe I should make that even more broad because if if we if, if, if, if, if climate change and biodiversity loss and these other major problems that we face are symptoms of a cognitive dysfunction at the societal level."
"Unknown","00;09;32;29","00;10;10;15","I mean, that's what I would call it, a societal dysfunction. A cognitive dysfunction because we've known about these problems for decades, you know, with climate change, we've known about it for more than 50 years, and yet we have it. We've failed to succeed adequately address the issues So I would say that all of these major problems are symptoms of a could have a cognitive problem or symptoms of a cognitive dysfunction and then the question becomes, OK, well, if we're not cognitive incorrectly, what kinds of where do we look for better models?"
"Unknown","00;10;10;15","00;10;33;16","Where do we look for ideas? Of how we might cognitive better? And I would say that in the world of biology, including the human brain, there's just, you know, a million or a large number of examples that we can learn from. How does nature compute? How nature has been at this for a very, very long time? The and how does how does it work in nature?"
"Unknown","00;10;33;23","00;10;59;16","And maybe we can align ourselves with the same program, the same process that's going on all around us. And if we do, then there's I would say there's the chance of building systems that are much more effective that at achieving the the intrinsic, um, you know, our goal, which is to achieve and maintain vitality far into the future."
"Unknown","00;11;00;10","00;11;32;13","Yeah. Steven and then Leigh and I was just going to sort of build on that because with active inference, one thing that sometimes comes up in, you know, is that rather than the brain being like a computer per say that it's a distributed and actually now maybe even, not even functionally specialized in certain regions but you know, it's more of a distributed system of which, you know, we're not exactly sure exactly how that works, but the idea of it being a dynamical sort of prediction engine."
"Unknown","00;11;32;25","00;11;58;24","So I'm, I'm wondering how that could how much might that inform where you go with this is that. Oh yeah. Total it because I we're using the word brain. But but even when I'm thinking brain, I'm thinking whole body and body is connected to each other, other bodies in society. But I in part one of the series on the title is called Worldview."
"Unknown","00;11;59;04","00;12;26;18","And I try to set up a context for all of this. And as part of that context, I know I point out that everything is intelligence. Like every piece of life is connected to every other piece of life, you know, either strongly or weakly. And and the whole whole of life is processing information. I mean, that's essentially what life is doing, is processing information, taking, reducing the uncertainty about the past or about the future from the past."
"Unknown","00;12;27;07","00;12;58;25","So, yes, absolutely. You know, we have the forties, for example, and we have distributed we have like in part three, it I use the analogy of between neurons and individuals in a society. And so how do neurons associate with other and disassociate with other? There's kind of a compliment as to how people associate and disassociate with other with others in the in the process."
"Unknown","00;12;58;26","00;13;27;23","Of societal cognition. And so we have connections in the brain. We have connections to our bodies, connections to our emotions. Connections to our feet and fingertips and connections to everything that is happening around us in our in our immediate environments, connections to each other. And all of that plays a role in cognition. So I'm not so I'm talking about cognition and the large sense, not in the narrow sense."
"Unknown","00;13;28;03","00;13;56;19","And I'm certainly not talking about a computer model that tells everybody what to do. That's that's not at all what this is about. Thanks, John Lee. And then anyone else who raises their hands and it was more of an observation, really. It is just when you were saying that you were drawing on the UN natural biological systems for inspiration and it occurred to me that then what you're doing is a kind of a bio mimicry machine."
"Unknown","00;13;56;25","00;14;20;12","Yes, but but, you know, building on Steven's point is not in the oldest sense of, you know, the mind is computer, but much more in the kind of the newer sense is no biology at all levels being able to cognate right Right. Absolutely. I think I've read by Buckminster Fuller. He said something one day. He said, I think I'm a process not a thing."
"Unknown","00;14;21;03","00;15;06;10","I'm paraphrasing there, but that's right. It's like all of life is a process, an intelligent process. Cool. And those and those just you know, I'll say it again, but those ideas really are new to science. And what the I mean, you know, the mainstream science. No, to mainstream science and just the last two decades or something like that, I mean, fairly recent concepts of of complex systems that you know, cognitive systems, the interconnectedness of all things, the intelligence of all things, trees, communicating with other trees, through, you know, through soil, fungus and all of these many of these ideas are actually quite recent in the science world."
"Unknown","00;15;07;12","00;15;29;10","And a funny note on that is that mainstream science is new in the social cognition world. The professionalization of science is a new topic and a new genre and I really like some of these points about distributed systems. We can think about distributed systems within one level of analysis or one system of interest, like within the ant colony."
"Unknown","00;15;29;10","00;15;53;25","It's a distributed system or within the brain, it's a distributed system. But once you start thinking about brains, John, you mentioned the four E, the extended inactive, embedded and cultured could be more e adjectives, but that brings out the richness and says, yes, it's distributed system among the neurons in the brain. And then the brain is interfacing with the body and the body with its niche and the tools and the social affordances."
"Unknown","00;15;54;10","00;16;22;02","And it's starting to sound like a lot of topics that we've talked about on active livestreams. So it's so awesome to see how we're taking some threads from the past and weaving them together. And I hope that we can draw this out. How a multi scale distributed systems perspective on cognition coupled with a social transformation agenda and preference vectors representing policy can get combined through active inference into something that's applied."
"Unknown","00;16;23;23","00;16;50;21","Right, right. How to act, how to make decisions under uncertainty. That's what all of this, all of this is about as a as a counterpoint to some of that or is a different view and some of what we just talked about. Imagine if we can look at how our society treats individuals. I mean, we can look at the extreme inequalities of wealth and income or different levels of access to health care."
"Unknown","00;16;50;21","00;17;34;05","You know, like there's all these issues, social issues that we face right now. Imagine if your brain acted that way somehow, you know, with with different neurons where some neurons were just simply starved. Some neurons were excluded from the computation process. Some neurons were given very few resources, just barely enough to survive. And others had so many resources that they were they were like wasting their resources because they had so much I mean, imagine how well the brain or how poorly the might function, if that's the way neurons interacted if that was the community, if if the community of neurons was anything like the community of of of individuals in our society, we wouldn't be"
"Unknown","00;17;34;05","00;18;07;07","able to make hardly any decisions. We'd be a mess that environments. It reminds me of again, it's fame in the brain model and the firing rates of neurons are not identical. Some are firing many times for second, others fire not even in a day perhaps. So there's there's a lot of distributions in these complex systems. And how do we think about the whole distribution as an outcome of a complex process rather than just trying to identify some sort of an outlier or some sort of single phenomena."
"Unknown","00;18;07;16","00;18;30;22","It's not the leverage point that system interventions will be effective at. So Steven, and then any other raised hints this also ties in, I think, nicely with the idea of post normal science, the idea that in the post normal science world, where you in high levels of uncertainty, you have to make decisions. So COVID is a classic case, right?"
"Unknown","00;18;30;22","00;19;00;13","We didn't they had to make choices in January, February, March, April, even now, and you don't have the data, right? You don't know. And in the same way with active inference, the brain and different parts of the body are making action policy selections as is going to inform action. And that's not quite the normal realm of where science is in this but this is where we're going to be going as we hit climate change and all sorts of other complex questions."
"Unknown","00;19;00;13","00;19;22;11","So that also is quite an interesting tie in because crystallography. Now he did some modeling on Code 19 as well. We got into that. Yeah. John, maybe you could unpack that in the context of second order science, which you discussed in the papers. Yeah, yeah. Or maybe I can just pass it to Lee if you will. Is yeah."
"Unknown","00;19;22;15","00;19;57;29","Is there, is there is the expert, you know, I don't know. I'm happy to. And so the that the concept of second order science really is just that the, the idea that the scientist can't be separated from the systems that they are studying. So really where that's kind of led to a systems transformation research is is that the only way that we can really understand systems by engaging with them and learning how to change them ourselves so we can't kind of stand back and just try and focus on epistemic knowledge alone really."
"Unknown","00;19;58;07","00;20;41;02","And that also implies this kind of second order understanding of ourselves and how our own cognitive systems work is part of the systems that we are engaging with and hope that was a value driven, value driven science where the more the scientists as part of the experiment with the stakeholders. Absolutely, we want while we have you here, that paper my facey was was authored by a very large number of people you and can you just say if you know the story behind that I well a little bit I think it was also before I started studying with him but there's a transformation community really."
"Unknown","00;20;41;02","00;21;02;04","I guess of researchers and I think it probably came out of one of the conferences that's been going on. So it's a sort of the product of a discussion between many researchers, which is that the way that they kind of prefer to write, really like moving away from this idea of, you know, the single genius to let's kind of gather and figure this stuff out together."
"Unknown","00;21;02;14","00;21;32;27","Right? I reference phases paper several times in my part. Number two. So readers can see how that fits into the bigger picture here. And it's funny that that idea that the product of research is collaborative, it's a colony phenotype, it's a group phenotype, how well this paper is and how many people site it and how much impact it have, it's not going to be reduced back down to a single person."
"Unknown","00;21;33;13","00;21;55;25","And so let's take that. And then just like you brought up Lee, the implications of of learn by doing is that we have to infer by acting basically. So then what does it mean for the scientist who's all in on that to be studying climate change on a coast or the conservation of a forest or sociology or anthropology?"
"Unknown","00;21;57;08","00;22;19;28","Very interesting questions that I hope a lot of different listeners can see resonating with their own situation. So Stephen, and then any other raised hints? I think just also building on the idea of this distributed input is and in many cases it may end up a lot of the may end up a lot of the work is not in science anymore."
"Unknown","00;22;19;29","00;22;47;28","It's like science informed development or science informed or even science in forming a module. And the model informs practices which inform the way that communities can get involved. So now the real agent is actually the community and the risk of them. So this interesting shift between where science fits in and can change, you know, I think that's quite interesting as well."
"Unknown","00;22;48;06","00;23;16;17","Yeah, well, you know, I could have I could have titled the entire series Science Influenced the Transformation because that is the concept I was going for. I call it science driven, but the the, my, my idea there was the similar and also the historical perspective, which includes many world knowledge traditions and hundreds and thousands of years and multiple continents, not just the story of Western academia understanding that that has not been a steady state."
"Unknown","00;23;16;29","00;23;50;26","There's no station parity with peer review. Again mainstream science especially the second half of the 1900s and further that's new so science is in transformation and it has always been in dialog from 10,000 years ago. So now given the agency that we have and who we are and our affordances our preferences what's the move. So we don't have any sort of a locked in phase to resist against that's not to say there's not inertia, but it is to say that there's actually a lot of agility in the system."
"Unknown","00;23;51;09","00;24;13;25","The question is what are the leverage points where we can actually make that impact and how might active inference come into play and you know, maybe since we're on the topic, maybe we can just switch to jump ahead to just a little bit. I can find it if you like, or you find the slide and then like go for it."
"Unknown","00;24;16;25","00;24;47;01","Go ahead. Lee, just to pick up on your point that Dan, really, I mean, and I've kind of been hesitant to say it in the active inference kind of, you know, this could set in the like I see such a huge amount of emphasis on active inclusive as a means to to create a kind improve A.I. And I can't help I mean, I really spend thinking about how can this knowledge be used to improve our own individual cognition and psycho cognition, even cognition."
"Unknown","00;24;47;11","00;25;03;16","Right about there doesn't seem to be. And I mean, maybe I'm just missing some of the literature on that. So if there is anything, I point me towards it. But it really seems to be, you know, like the big assumption is, you know, we've got to put this stuff in A.I. because that's where all the progress is going to be, et cetera, et cetera."
"Unknown","00;25;03;19","00;25;26;27","And I kind of wonder, is that really a wise goal? I don't know. I think active inference and several other paths. So not exclusive to active inference. It rethinks artificial part of artificial intelligence because it's part of our extended niche. And so, yes, there's been a lot of focus on applying active inference to machine learning and to reinforcement learning, those types of areas."
"Unknown","00;25;27;11","00;25;58;18","And then what we're talking towards here is the integration of natural and artificial intelligence under a broader extended cognitive systems scope. So humans in the loop or real time computers, just like every stoplight or every bank transaction is going to be every tweet is going to be designing those interfaces so that within each blanket there's functional cognition not viewed only from the outside in, but as part of a broader system."
"Unknown","00;25;59;01","00;26;22;02","And maybe we find out that we had good enough artificial intelligence, so-called algorithms in 2004, and that we just had to hook them up in a different way. Just like connecting different parts of piping could give you an engine that's more or less efficient. Maybe it wasn't the case that we needed some sort of scaling on a larger data set, but we needed a new way to combine subcomponents, which is what biology does as well."
"Unknown","00;26;22;18","00;27;19;01","So yeah, got just a few just a few more thoughts on that. So this the science world and particularly this this cognitive cognitive framework or concept of what is cognition, I think can be useful both at the societal level and at the individual level. I mean, in the sense that if if science can help direct the attention of the world to, to how, how intelligence happens all around us in nature, all around us every day, how, you know, how we evolve to to you know, expand on the information process and the information processing, the capacity for information processing so it helps it help in any you know, just helps an individual to understand a little"
"Unknown","00;27;19;01","00;27;44;15","better or have a different perspective on what am I doing? What is what am I, why am I here? What am I doing? Why why am I what am I, you know, to to a degree that the these this these new developments in cognitive science can help to shed some light on questions like that. And at the same time, for a society like, what are we doing here together?"
"Unknown","00;27;44;15","00;28;17;17","What is our purpose together? Right. And if you know your purpose, it's a lot easier to know where to go next, how to how to frame things in a way that is suitable for your continued being. And it's a it's a bright line in some senses between first and second order science. In the first order science literature, there might be a lot of sort of engineering type appeals to we'll make the society more efficient or science and foreign policy will just simply be better."
"Unknown","00;28;18;03","00;28;39;17","And once we take that second order turn we start to think we're going to have increased clarity about our values. It's not going to be an easy conversation. We might need to invent new ways of having the conversation or formalizing our values. But we need some sort of path that's going to bring us closer to clarity on our values rather than obscuring it with technical advances."
"Unknown","00;28;39;28","00;29;18;04","So Stephen, or John, go ahead. And then Stephen. Well, I was just going to say obscuring it with technical details, but also obscuring it with with incompatible abilities between what the science world is saying and doing and what say the governance world is saying and doing or the economic world is saying and doing. Obviously, if all of these systems are part of the cognitive architecture, you want them, you want to design them so that they are integrated with each other, so that the signals, you know, travel from one to the next, just as the signals in your body travel from one, you know, one system to the next system."
"Unknown","00;29;19;10","00;29;59;04","Yep. Stephen. And I think this also ties into partly what this lab has been talking about quite a lot in trying to enable this possibility of making those transitions without losing the the rigor of the modeling. Because the modeling is seen as almost another way to get empirical data. It's not the same as science but the challenge you have as things unlike traditional science going towards engineering, you do have this ability to embrace effects and values but the challenge is how to stop things getting prematurely ratified, how it's so easy things get ratified and suddenly effective early."
"Unknown","00;29;59;06","00;30;25;24","You're just using another word for system boundary, and you're kind of really doing the same paradigm work with some different window dressing, right? So it's really that's the challenge, I think, to, to and I don't think anyone's quite managed to do that yet, but I think that's definitely, you know, that we're on the cusp. This is this is happening, you know, right now this this the struggle of what does it mean and how do we do it."
"Unknown","00;30;26;16","00;30;52;04","And the premature ratification as you said, Stephen, it's basically there's a perfect investing strategy. You know, if you had the time machine, you'd know exactly when to buy the dip so high we don't have that. We're moving forward. We don't have access to the future. So there's two kinds of confidence errors. There would be being overly confident. So too early zoning in on a solution."
"Unknown","00;30;52;04","00;31;26;00","That's the premature reification and the other fallacy or the other side of that perfect strategy would be waiting too long. And so somewhere between waiting too long and acting too fast is that trade off space that we have from so many different perspectives with not just finding the value of explore versus exploit, that's going to be best, but rethinking the explore and exploit outcomes as part of a process that might be doing something like balancing epistemic and pragmatic value."
"Unknown","00;31;26;00","00;31;52;29","For example, in in the free energy principle. So it's a really awesome conversation. And John, continue and altering how you measure fitness relative to those to those two differences. Well, since we've been talking, you've been talking about science, the role of science in this. Why don't we jump ahead to a slide to jump over to slide 16, if you would."
"Unknown","00;31;53;07","00;32;18;24","Yep. And while you've. Oh, that's fast and will we get that, Roland, just one more effort on second order versus first order science, you know, physics, paper is great. Really, I think an important one. But it's new. I mean, that's it's new to the science world. Most of the science world is very focused on what we would call first order sites."
"Unknown","00;32;18;24","00;32;44;16","Where the scientist is a part is is is an observer of a system not engaged with transformation of that system or achieving value driven goals in that system. And the first order science is fantastic. You know, we learn we have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge, gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from first quarter science. So it is it is fantastic for what it is."
"Unknown","00;32;44;16","00;33;13;14","And, you know, has to be continued. But in addition to that, we can also start to be thinking about what is second order science, how how can the science world be engaged in a value driven effort towards some better future? And I suspect that there are lots of scientists who are frustrated and who are frustrated because they don't know how to there's not an avenue for them to participate in."
"Unknown","00;33;13;27","00;33;52;21","And really jumping in to make this world a better place, that intelligent people look at our world and they see the enormous stress that we're under in this moment. And are fearful of the of the even larger distress that's that is likely about to befall us. So I think that there might be a tremendous amount of frustration in the science world of how do we how do we use our capacities to actually fundamentally make things better as opposed to just passing off."
"Unknown","00;33;52;27","00;34;23;04","You know, I'm, you know, sort of at trivializing it a bit here, but just passing out a recommendation to some policymakers who then do whatever they do, you know, that a scientist is then out of the loop so I think that this is the time for second order science to flourish. This is the this is the opportunity for the science community to really get engaged in these deep and important problems that civilization faces right now."
"Unknown","00;34;23;19","00;35;00;13","And in the in the in the series, I'm trying to propose an R&D program that is a path for the science world to get involved in these in these deeper questions and have an impact, a deeper impact on civilization. So this this slide is is kind of a summary of my paper of of why should science, you know, why should science care about this and why should science get involved and we can just we can talk about any number of these, but I'll just sort of jump through them a little bit just to highlight a few ideas."
"Unknown","00;35;02;05","00;35;33;13","The very first one is just this idea of societal cognition. That's that's, you know, that's kind of new. That's that's there's there's great potential for scientific discovery. Just on that question of how what does is society cognate? How does it cognate, you know, in what ways, by what mechanisms, by what features, in what with what characteristics. I mean, there's you know, just as far as expanding the level of knowledge, this question is really interesting."
"Unknown","00;35;35;23","00;36;11;20","On the second one, so we're talking about designing societal systems. And obviously this is a really complex issue. These are not this is not a simple how do you build a better can opener? Right. This is this is difficult and complex issues. And the science world has has skills that can be really useful in addressing these questions and framing the framing the movement towards how do we how do we start, how do we test, what are the how do we measure fitness?"
"Unknown","00;36;11;20","00;36;56;16","How do we what is the goal? What is the purpose? What are we doing? You know, the science world would have a lot to say about framing this entire question. Of what is societal transformation and how would we move how would we move forward with it. I might add to that to this that is, as I see it, at least one of the benefits of having the science world involved in this question of societal transformation is that the science world can provide a kind of object, sort of objective and consistent metrics and frameworks to help guide the process that is turned around."
"Unknown","00;36;57;18","00;37;30;07","If, if this, if this if this process of societal transformations program societal transformation was merely based on what a group like the this group votes for this. Let's do this and this other group votes for let's do this. And it was just it was just a popularity contest of whatever was most popular in the moment. That's where that's where that's where the transformation is going."
"Unknown","00;37;30;23","00;37;53;12","I don't think the science world would have any much interest in that, like popularity contests or that kind of that kind of effort. Where is this? You know, where's the knowledge in that? Where's the science? And then I don't if it would be on the other hand, I think it would be very interesting to the science world if transformation was based on some kind of principled approach, some kind of summit."
"Unknown","00;37;53;19","00;38;16;03","Like we can agree to that to an extent. At least we can agree what fitness might mean for society and some of that would be based on objective measures. Some of it might be based on subjective measures, but intelligent people can get together and and conceptualize what fitness for a society or for a societal system might look like."
"Unknown","00;38;16;08","00;38;45;09","Well, these are, of course, complicated problems, deep problems. But if we could do that as a community, if we could if we could find some way to assess fitness in a reasonable, reasonable way, a reasonably coherent way, a reasonably consistent way, then then we have a passport to move forward of, you know, different different groups could try different ways to reach a high fitness."
"Unknown","00;38;46;08","00;39;21;03","And all of those experiments would be adding to the body of knowledge of how do we do this so that fitness improves. Right. I don't mean to to say that that coming up with fitness scores and fitness evaluations of new systems would be easy but it isn't it isn't a topic that we can tackle. And it's because that because of the our capacity to conceptualize fitness and, and formalize fitness in the sense of of a formal assessment, I think that makes the whole I'm hoping that makes the whole project interesting."
"Unknown","00;39;21;03","00;39;45;23","To the science world because now we're now this is science know this now this is expanding knowledge. This is using the first principles and scientific principles to evaluate systems. And it's and it's not a popularity contest. It's not you know, this is this is adding to our understanding of, of, of how the world works and how intelligence works and how cognition works."
"Unknown","00;39;46;03","00;40;22;16","You know, in expanding it out to the societal level, I think we'll be maybe there some thoughts on that alone yet. Stephen, and then anyone else who raises their hand yeah. Just sort of a couple of questions around the idea of fitness landscapes and how that might be used is I sense your sort of proposal in that you could use these kind of fitness landscape, I suppose you could even have to on free energy landscapes to try and help inform policy selection, i.e. maybe which research streams you're going to go down."
"Unknown","00;40;24;08","00;40;50;00","Because at the moment, you know, we're kind of either tied into what the market says or some other methods, but this could be because this, this fitness may be consumed separate now because I could see a couple of different ways you could look at that then. Is it like an extra field of practice to inform choosing the policy of which research field to go down and which avenues, or is it also within the field?"
"Unknown","00;40;50;06","00;41;16;11","Is it with fields connecting to each other? I just wondered how that might be. You know, it's all of those because because everything that we do ought to be serving our purpose, you know, I mean, I obviously there's great room for play and, you know, and exploration and all that kind of stuff. I don't mean to, to, to make humans, you know, a two dimensional or something."
"Unknown","00;41;16;26","00;41;44;03","Humans are complex organisms. They have complex needs, and all of those needs must be addressed. Right. But but love, fitness, I the concept of fitness, I see that. I see that as permeating multiple levels. Right. Because because, yes, we would want to choose policies that help us. And then and then what does health mean? What does it mean how does it look if it helps us?"
"Unknown","00;41;44;03","00;42;08;12","What what does that all about? Right. So in some sense, if we just say, I want to help, we're already thinking, you know, what will improve fitness somehow, right? But not just policy, but even structural design of what how to what is a system, how what what, what how does society make decisions? How do we communicate? What is our communication systems?"
"Unknown","00;42;08;21","00;42;41;24","How do we get input from everyone into this process of decision making? You know, like like so across the board, both in the structural design of systems and institutions and and even to some degree, the social norms, right. Through education systems, like what kinds of social norms help us and then obviously to then in, in policy. But then even in our individual lives, it helps."
"Unknown","00;42;42;02","00;43;07;15","I think it might help individuals to understand that that what we want is improved quality of life, lower uncertainty. How can I make decisions in my own life that bring me the things that I that I think might actually make me feel better, that actually might serve me on an even a superficial and deep level so thanks, John Lee."
"Unknown","00;43;07;23","00;43;34;14","And then Stephen yeah. Just some thoughts on on the fitness metrics, really. So and this kind of goes to the goes to the point about the way that scientists need to engage with local communities because there's a there's quite a lot of work that's already started in that area and a lot of it is and is based around this idea of place."
"Unknown","00;43;34;27","00;44;03;27","So scale is already being taken into account. And there's this whole kind of sense of the emerging bioregional movement, which just essentially means aligning your political and governance boundaries with the boundaries of ecosystems and and that then naturally has the effect of it partitions things in a way that's meaningful to local people. And then you can start to ask them what is it that they value within their place?"
"Unknown","00;44;03;27","00;44;32;25","Because they're already kind of connected to it in a way. And I mean, I suppose one thing to me is this idea of metrics really versus counterfactual simulation, because once you start putting a metric on something, you know, like you have a number and then, you know, that's something that people can't really care about. Whereas, you know, if they can imagine how their, you know, their local river system, for example, wouldn't be polluted by you know, sewage being released from a sewage works or, you know, runoff from that."
"Unknown","00;44;33;08","00;44;56;13","And they could see, you know, that then has this sort of the effect of, you know, of engaging people. I think more in the in the actions that we would need to collaboratively take to make these kind of things happen. Sure. Sure. That different people might react in different ways to some people might be more, you know, really appreciate the modeling aspect."
"Unknown","00;44;56;13","00;45;20;07","Other people might just appreciate the boots on the ground, local change aspect. But I would say there's room for all of that. And the bio regionalism concepts are great. I've been a fan for a long time, and who knows, maybe in the future will move more and more towards that so that communities are really localized in their environment and, and protecting their environment and all that kind of stuff."
"Unknown","00;45;20;28","00;45;41;12","That's great in some ways. In some ways, science has to catch up with communities of change who have been working on this for a long time. These, these concepts and other ways. Science is already, you know, pulling, pulling communities, you know, helping to say more. There's more, there's more, there's more we can do. There's a bigger picture we can serve here."
"Unknown","00;45;42;16","00;46;10;05","So it'll be a give and take, I think, between communities and this one more thing is the bio regionalism idea is great, and a lot of work also has been done and alternatives to gap. So, you know, the metrics that are that people are talking about, about, you know, considering education and longevity and disease and all these other things as opposed to just a single GDP measure of a societal quality."
"Unknown","00;46;11;02","00;46;30;02","So there's lots of work being done on multiple fields. And to speak to the metrics from an active inference perspective, let's just say that we wanted a river that was unpolluted. We want to know toxins in the river. So our preference in the active inference model would be that the river is clean that be in our preference vector."
"Unknown","00;46;30;11","00;46;57;19","Now, traditional reinforcement learning would look at the level and it would reinforce policies that reduce pollution locally, and then it would forget policies that didn't locally. Now the question is, let's just say you start decreasing it and all of a sudden it starts creeping back up your reinforcement learner is going to be quite confused. So in active inference, we can say that our metric is actually our uncertainty around our generative model of the river's pollution."
"Unknown","00;46;58;03","00;47;23;03","So then what actions can we take if our uncertainty starts to get wider? How can we increase our precision on our generative model of pollution? And then, of course, concomitantly with our values that it be unpolluted? How can we act to reduce our uncertainty? And so it's the reinforcement economic maximization mindset. Pick the metric I want everyone to read."
"Unknown","00;47;23;10","00;48;01;04","That's the metric reading well, no, the preference is that everyone can read, but the metric in active inference is our uncertainty around our observations. And it's an extremely subtle at first, but eventually a very far reaching way to think about these systems and what fitness is. Because a lot of times fitness metrics, people are going to be thinking right like GDP or right, like something that we want to see, but we can actually now tease apart our preferences from our affordances, from our uncertainty and our generative model and several other features of active inference scale free models."
"Unknown","00;48;01;13","00;48;27;02","And that is going to help us have a multi stakeholder conversation in a new way. That's great, great, great, great, great, great, great. Thank you, John. Yeah, just add to that, I totally I totally agree with what Daniel just mentioned there because the it's not almost it's not an act of inference per se on its own, but it's the ability of active inference to be used in this epistemic foraging way."
"Unknown","00;48;27;12","00;48;51;09","And I think the point that was made there about reinforcement learning, which we kind of think, oh, that's some machine learning method. But actually reinforcement learning is the dominant approach to development. It's like it's the way humans have structured in a way their own thinking. It's not exactly reinforcement learning as such, but it's, it's so constrained and it's so goal driven."
"Unknown","00;48;52;00","00;49;20;00","And the only integrated way to overcome it and we fractured and started saying there is no alternatives. Is the market saying it can't deal with the complexity beyond a certain point. So you have to offload it to this market, which again, you get into that kind of just becomes whatever's the favorite of the day. And this gives us a way to get into this nuance, complexity gives us at least the chance to go some other routes and plausibly deliver on that promise."
"Unknown","00;49;20;00","00;49;43;27","You know, I think that's really cool. It's absolutely got to give like a spatial metaphor on brain first, first. But learning versus active inference. It's like if there's a mountain peak that we know that we want to get to, the reinforcement learner would say, OK, the goal and the reward is the elevation. And so it can get trapped on a local elevation peak, but then it might not take a step backwards or down a few to get to the highest peak."
"Unknown","00;49;44;14","00;50;02;19","But again, if we do a trajectory of policy inference on getting to the top of a mountain again, of course, as a preference that we have for ourselves in the future, we can ask, am I reducing my uncertainty about how I'm going to get there, when I'm going to get there, the way that we're going to do it together?"
"Unknown","00;50;03;02","00;50;34;02","With potentially a group of hikers who have different capacities instead of how are we going to get to the top of a little knoll and then just stake out. So it's a different conversation style. Stephen. Yeah. Than anyone else. Yeah. And so building on that is when you have that come into play is the ability for the active inference approaches like you're talking about is magnified greatly when you don't just focus on the one person or the two people who are like the agents of change."
"Unknown","00;50;34;02","00;50;51;14","But you say, well, what about the local people who have no idea about the goal, they have no ability to elevate, they have no ability to contribute to the reinforcement learning, but they know the slopes. They can tell me the history, they can tell me where people felt their death in the past or where there's, you know, all this."
"Unknown","00;50;51;14","00;51;30;28","And that then makes the place make place based, community based contributions much more plausible as why they they enable the scientists and other people to do exactly what you're talking about. You know? Excellent. Just to just to point out, when so we're talking about reducing and expected uncertainty about the future. Right. Think of all the ways that that think about the implications of that in, say, a, you know, design of systems or design of institutions or actions of humans, you know, facing some problem right."
"Unknown","00;51;30;28","00;51;50;18","So so one question that immediately arises is do we have enough information? Are we collecting the right information at the right frequency to even understand what's going on or to reduce our uncertainty? Second is how good are we are anticipating the future? Are we can can we do that with some accuracy? Do we know what's going to happen next?"
"Unknown","00;51;50;18","00;52;22;29","We have any idea what's going to happen next? How good or how good are our how good are our worldview concepts that lead to anticipation of the future and how good are our, you know, computational models about what's going to happen next how good is our information, information sharing capacities? How are we communicating with each other? Are we communicating the information between groups and between individuals such that we can understand what's going to happen next and understand what our uncertainty levels are?"
"Unknown","00;52;24;08","00;52;56;23","You know, like I could go on, but there's like this. It seems like a simple proposition at first. And then you realize that proposition has enormous depth it implies all kinds of things about how a society might function and organize itself. 11 thought on the wisdom of crowds and distributed computation. There's a famous example from early in quantitative genetics where it was at a world's fair, and a crowd was asked, you know, you put in a raffle ticket, you can predict how much some cow weighs."
"Unknown","00;52;57;09","00;53;24;19","And then the average of the estimates was extremely accurate, although many individuals were, of course, distantly off the mark. And a lot of people take that just straightforwardly as existence of the wisdom of crowds. But there's a few pieces of that scenario that really matter. The first is that the people attending may have had experience, they may have been working in agricultural settings or have experience with getting feedback on their predictions and secondly, the estimate was a bit bounded."
"Unknown","00;53;24;19","00;53;44;15","It wasn't that the cow was £1 or £10,000. There was an estimate here, and then it was still a cognitive diversity that contributed to that estimate. So you could just look at somebody who overestimates that. What get rid of that guy is wrong is like that's counterbalanced by someone on the other side. Of that curve. That's how we're getting an estimate."
"Unknown","00;53;44;26","00;54;13;15","So having a distributional and a community perspective on decision making helps us recognize and encourage and foster diversity of opinion and also structure a resilient community. So it's something that will be really interesting to see how and where these kinds of memes and ideas pop up. Yeah, absolutely. You valuing differences of opinion and valuing differences of perspective is one."
"Unknown","00;54;13;19","00;54;41;28","One thing that you said there, I just add just add something to that is that in our polarized society today, we, we, you know, there's like liberals and there's conservatives, at least in the US and they seem to be in two different universes almost. Right. But liberal and conservative at their best. Is a little bit like exploration versus exploitation."
"Unknown","00;54;41;28","00;55;09;29","You know, the necessary balance for any organism or for any decision making process to balance exploration of the unknown and exploitation of what is already known, what is traditional, what is our history? What what do we know works you know, like at their best, liberal and conservatism are both important. And just as exploration and exploitation are both important in problem solving and they're relative just like left and right and relative."
"Unknown","00;55;09;29","00;55;37;04","Yeah. When you're spinning around and things are changing, it's hard to say. And that's why we can pull back to some real pillars of biological systems instead of trying to scaffold further and further into the political or logistical ether, we can actually return to our grounding as a biological society. So, Lee, I saw your Henry's or maybe I didn't or Stephen."
"Unknown","00;55;37;23","00;56;02;23","Stephen, and then anyone else who raised their hands, that was quite interesting. We made that point there about, you know, we look to explore the unknown. And I think that in addition to that, because that's from the perspective of, say, the scientist or the person in the kind of the knowledge generating game, so to speak, there, that's their profession or whatever."
"Unknown","00;56;03;14","00;56;42;27","But there's also the exploring the known but not known that it's known the tacit, the so this is where communities can come in is like there's there's like they by realizing that some of that unknown is participants in those environments. No, it just needs to be surface this is where some of the work with the environment side of the act of inference, the niche and these topographies that I'm quite interested in my side can come in because now they're exploring a movie and in stuff and in a way which is networked in the sort of not just isolated as single stories or experiences and fragmented."
"Unknown","00;56;43;07","00;57;07;18","So I think that connects with what you're saying. Can you give one example of what you're thinking? So one example, we did a project around water issues in rural areas. Of Northern Makuta land in South Africa, and so they had different areas of water catchment. So some people were getting water from a lake but the lake had hippos and, you know, crocodiles."
"Unknown","00;57;07;18","00;57;33;22","So it was a bit challenging for them in different ways. And so you've got these different water catchment areas and it's like they had the lived experience of having to go there, having to get the water, having to boil it because if the water is contaminated, you got to boil it and then the other what it means then if you're then doing that, if you've got someone at home who's got HIV on top of that, so then you know, so they can't walk or they've got to have so all these questions."
"Unknown","00;57;33;22","00;57;57;17","So what they would do is they would create a fabric map the size of the room about all their different routes to water and then share the stories from eight different over numbers of hotspots and then that became the sort of landscape so doing so that that wasn't given the answers, but it was informing another process, maybe a week later, which was looking for innovations, looking for options for new approaches."
"Unknown","00;57;57;17","00;58;19;02","So that's one type of way that you could like reveal something from the local landscape, which would never been available to an engineer about knowledge. They have great stuff, great stuff. So some of what you're talking about is what is our narrative? What is our individual narrative and what is our shared narrative, right? Like what is our life?"
"Unknown","00;58;19;09","00;58;46;18","What is our experience of life and what does it what do I as an individual have what what knowledge and lived experience can I offer to this group that would help the group to eventually function better or make better decisions? Right. So that's a really interesting question to me. For many reasons. But one reason is how? How so?"
"Unknown","00;58;46;18","00;59;15;02","Let's suppose we were to move forward with this. This this whole project was moving forward how do we communicate with each other richly? What I would I would argue that there is no system, no functional system, right? Now that a million people or 10,000 people can richly communicate their lived experience, their their understanding of life, their understanding of how what might happen if A, B and C happen."
"Unknown","00;59;16;04","00;59;42;08","I don't think we have a world need of tools to richly communicate, you know, and I mean, we're in need of tools. Yeah. So that's an immediate opportunity for groups to get involved with just at just that little question of how would we communicate and how would we, how would we, how would we make decisions together in some kind of collaborative fashion?"
"Unknown","00;59;42;19","01;00;03;04","How do we how do, how to 10,000 people do that on 7 million people when you can't all sit in a room? You know, that's the question. When you can't all sit in a room to really thoroughly discuss these issues and listen to each other, how do we do that at scale great. So that that is and and and I think I think there could be answers to that."
"Unknown","01;00;03;04","01;00;32;27","That's not an impossible task. That's a really interesting and, and doable task if we just put our minds to it. It's but it's really two regimes of attention and active inference perspectives on narratives which were even our first active livestream number one was on narrative active inference because we think it's crucial. And if there's going to be a social narrative like you had brought up, well that's something that is not just charted into a person's brain."
"Unknown","01;00;33;03","01;00;52;18","It's not a holograph where it's the same in the person's brain as it is at the social level. Things that brains know that neurons don't. It's not like each neuron is holding a little mini brain. It's actually that there is differences among neurons. Or if you think about like Star Wars or a movie, it's like each character doesn't know the whole omniscient scope."
"Unknown","01;00;53;01","01;01;15;01","And so we're part of a bigger story. And so it's going to be interesting to explore what will it feel like as a person and what will it be like experientially with a personal narrative to be part of a broader societal narrative. But those will not be the same thing. And the desire for those to be the same thing will lead to system fragility."
"Unknown","01;01;15;05","01;01;43;22","In many cases, so Stephen. And then any other comments? Yeah, I think that that that ability to know certain things is a very important point. And I think in active inference, something that I've increasingly been looking at is we've got external states and we've got hidden states, OK, in different ways. So there's from the perspective of the generative model of, say, a water engineer, there will be more that there's hidden states from everything, right?"
"Unknown","01;01;43;22","01;02;26;07","From everyone to some extent. OK, as well as states that we can engage in. And so there will be this question about how do you engage the hidden states in a landscape as well as the external states of the regime of attention? And where can someone else who's got a different lived experience contribute to open up and maybe telling us where they think the meaningful aspects of their landscape are so I think that as well as modeling and happening from our own computational models and being able to maybe use some tools we can model through participation in place."
"Unknown","01;02;26;07","01;02;52;13","Mais place base. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, so this tool I have in mind, it's, it's I want to have my voice heard. I have a story that is that could be important to others, that could be important to any particular situation that or topic that society is trying to decide upon. And I would very much like my voice to be heard and not just a yes or no or not just a choose a, B or C way."
"Unknown","01;02;52;13","01;03;14;04","I would I have a rich experience that I want to communicate now. You know, another person sitting next to me might have a model of water quality or whatever the issue is, and they might have something to say about what their model implies. But all of those voices should be heard. All of those voices should be part of the cognitive process of the society."
"Unknown","01;03;14;14","01;03;51;07","So so certainly data driven, you know, model formal models of this and that. Sure. That's great. That's fantastic. It's an extension of our cognitive capacity and at the same time, I'm intelligent and I'm, you know, I can do things. A computer can't do that, at least today, you know, I can do many things, a computer can't. So whatever process, whatever communication system and process that develops out of this ought to be one where every voice can be heard, can be registered, can be incorporated into this larger, really cognitive process you're talking about."
"Unknown","01;03;51;14","01;04;17;06","You know, it's like sharing. And we discussing, but that's a cognitive process, right, for a group that because it's leading towards some better understanding of the world and, you know, improved decision making about the world. John, if I could, you mentioned data driven. So to again, sort of distinguish and contrast with how you're potentially using data driven versus how it might be implicitly used in other settings."
"Unknown","01;04;17;19","01;04;34;25","Data driven, who's being driven? US. The data are driving us and our policy. Oh, the policy is going to be data driven. OK, well, how about it's human driven? How about the policy? And our affordances and the data are like a car and we're driving the car do we need a better car? Does it have too many wheels?"
"Unknown","01;04;35;04","01;04;56;21","Where are we driving? Whose turn is it to drive? How are we choosing which music is being played in our human driven car? Not how are we going to fit into a data driven human mode? And it just interesting that sometimes what is left unsaid or unstated is where a lot of those values get swept under the rug."
"Unknown","01;04;56;29","01;05;31;17","It's data driven. What else you want to talk about? Oh, values. OK, well, there's time for values. It's like there has to be time for values. But the data driven conversation makes it sound like it's the beginning and the end. Right, right. Today. Yes, yes. And I think that can be expanded greatly and right. So that's that's when I use the word richness, that's a little bit of what I'm trying to imply is the richness of experience, the richness of perspectives, the richness of of past information that that I, as an individual can bring to bear on this issue, whatever the issue is."
"Unknown","01;05;31;17","01;05;54;05","And then on top of that, what what does the data what what data do we have? How frequent how frequently do we collect it? How what is its quality? How can it contribute to this discussion? Right so very much this the it's not that the computer has to decide what to do. It's that human beings have to decide, you know, what to do, how to given all this information, what do we do?"
"Unknown","01;05;54;06","01;06;27;00","How do we frame this? How do we frame our problem? How do we are we even looking at the right problem? Are we are we are is our focus, too? Narrow? Are we or do we need to broaden our focus to understand better how all of these different problems so very much human in the human in the center computation and to connect that to first and higher order science and I'd be curious to see what you think the first order project is like build a bridge the second order project is like given what needs to happen, is a bridge the best solution?"
"Unknown","01;06;27;00","01;06;46;14","Or maybe we could go about it a different way. And the third order is what really needs to be done here. What do we value? Who are we? Those types of third order questions, which potentially even are on an escape trajectory from science because we're not going to be looking to science in a narrow sense for the answer to that third order."
"Unknown","01;06;46;23","01;07;11;05","Truly human question. But we do need to expand this discussion from what is the best way to build the bridge, to how are we going to go about fulfilling transporting people from side to side or making a landmark for our city? There's different reasons why we might want to build a bridge, and people feel like a cog in the machine if they're just being instructed at the first order like do this right."
"Unknown","01;07;11;05","01;07;42;26","But what we're including people in higher orders, then we're part of a multi scale cognitive system. We're not just a, quote, cog in a machine. So then anyone else? Yeah, I think this is a really important point, and to me it touches on an you know, that messengers, transparency, opacity, kind of all we do, we understand the beliefs on the frames consciously that we're operating out of."
"Unknown","01;07;42;26","01;08;03;29","So in the, in the bridge metaphor or you know, you might say and at the third level, the third order aisle, it's really about how are we looking, how, you know, what's the ontology or the set of metaphors that we using coming at this system through and what affect today having in shaping, you know, our well and how we perceive it and then our actions towards that."
"Unknown","01;08;04;12","01;08;24;25","So, you know, going way back to the beginning of this discussion, it was quite interesting when Stephen asked you, John, about architecture. You know, and I'm kind of thinking is, you know, is that, you know, it's not is that a metaphor for, you know, the architecture the brain is that is that a way of looking at a brain or is it something you know, this parallels the discussions about mark of blankness, et cetera, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;08;25;05","01;08;42;12","You know, like are these things that we're imposing our systems or are they things that are really that? And I think the architecture one is really interesting because it kind of comes from this, you know, whole constructivist tradition. And I mean, I wonder more whether it's not so much whether it's about the right, you know, the most accurate way of seeing."
"Unknown","01;08;42;12","01;09;08;10","But what particular set of affordances does a model or legacy offer is in the face of this particular problem in Indonesia, perhaps? Yeah. Interesting stuff. Thank you, Lee John, continue or Stephen. And then John, feel free to continue. Yeah, just one last piece. I think that this there's some areas that I'm trying to apply these isms now and it's sort of put some buckets on."
"Unknown","01;09;08;18","01;09;37;17","I think the social constructivism is an important one to think about and maybe science in a way kind of fits in that in a way as a human pursuit. Pragmatism, I think is very well aligned with the kind of approach of active inference. And this approach here, if you take pragmatism from a, you know, a human, not humanistic prospect from a well from the third one, which is an ecological perspective, so or any ways of knowing as well, not even perspective."
"Unknown","01;09;37;17","01;10;27;29","So you can drop down into ways of knowing perspectives, you know, pragmatism, social constructivism and ecological approaches and I think that nexus is is quite important as a as a sort of way to hold some of these ideas you know, this is you know, this is a fantastic conversation. And and I would say that exactly the kind of conversation that would be needed to to move such a project forward, it would be conversations like this, you know, between scientists within the communities between communities touching around all of these, you know, some some superficial and some very deep and subtle issues and questions of how do we what are we thinking?"
"Unknown","01;10;27;29","01;10;51;20","How do we do this? How do we how do we measure success? What do we want? What is our purpose? I mean, you know, we're just maybe starting that conversation here among us. But I would like to offer to the science world that this could be we know this could be a function in the science world of, you know, a pursuit of study, of pursuit of of attention."
"Unknown","01;10;53;03","01;11;26;11","And if there were I think that, you know, the I think that's all that's really necessary, actually, is to put our minds to this and intelligent people communicating among themselves and engaging the all interested stakeholders could definitely make progress in this in this endeavor. So great great to watch. Great to be a part of and sure. Yeah. John, maybe if you want to go to another slide, but that's leads the question how do we in our adult one video it's kind of an opening."
"Unknown","01;11;26;16","01;11;49;15","The dark one is where we've had our background with a dot zeros. We've hopefully read the papers and digested them, written comments, written thoughts to ourself allowed that to reverberate. And then we open the doors and we come together in a group discussion, 4.1 and we also say, hey, the doors aren't closed. More people can join this conversation, whether it's next week, 4.2 or on a broader scale."
"Unknown","01;11;49;15","01;12;18;03","So I'm just wondering whether you answer now or later who can be included and how can they be included in participating? Right. Well, I was going to say a few words, but everyone is everyone is welcome in this conversation. And in the end, the world and communities in different in different, different types of communities, the science community, other the communities I mean, this is this is a conversation for all of us to be had."
"Unknown","01;12;18;03","01;12;44;07","What do we want? What is our purpose? What are we doing? How can we how can we improve and how can we reduce uncertainty, you know, about essential variables. You know, to put it more technically, how to do that? I don't know. I I'm open to suggestions of how we make the next step. But, you know, I sort of put out put out what I could put out in this series."
"Unknown","01;12;44;07","01;13;46;19","And I'm hoping that these conversations might lead to choose some actions that engage a larger and larger sphere of of individuals and organizations. So I'm open to suggestions. I'm open and could you flip to let's see that would be slide to talk to slide eight yet go for it. So we've touched on all these ideas and I thought maybe this might be a good moment to to talk about some of the practical implications well in our original discussions, this slide was coming after the after paper one which was all about worldview and seeing life as a cognitive process and seeing individuals as as overlapping processes of information flow and understanding that that when we talk"
"Unknown","01;13;46;19","01;14;15;06","about a community improving its its quality of life and quality environment, we're talking about an extended individual and extended community that really reaches all the way to the biosphere ultimately. Right? We're all connected with other individuals and all communities are connected with other communities and all of life is connected. We're connected with our local ecosystem and with this limbic system."
"Unknown","01;14;15;06","01;14;49;02","So what when I when I talk about vitality, I'm talking about the vitality of the whole, really, that's our purpose is human. We're intelligent, we're humans are very intelligent. We can think a thousand years into the future of what might happen if we do something today. And humans can use that capacity to improve and reduce the uncertainty of the whole improve quality of life, improve the quality of the environment and biodiversity and all that stuff."
"Unknown","01;14;49;18","01;15;21;23","So with that kind of theory, theoretical aspects in the past, what are some of the practical implications? Like how would we use any of that information to actually think about designing for societal systems right. So so this is a list of something, some items that we have talked about in previous talks and even touched on today and when we think about what does this mean practically, I would like to focus that to a different question really."
"Unknown","01;15;21;23","01;15;44;05","And that is how do we how does any individual, any organism solve a problem like what is necessary to solve a problem, whether you're a bacteria or you're a human community? Right. What do you do? And then on the left are, I would say, some of the universal aspects of of cognition, for example, you have to gather data."
"Unknown","01;15;44;05","01;16;17;10","I mean, you're the intelligent being is processing information. And information means that some kind of data or information has to come from the world and then it can be processed. It has to remember, for example, it has to anticipate the future forecast the future with some accuracy in order to survive. If I see, you know, the line, if I see a line in my path, I might want to accurately forecast that if I don't get out of the way, I might be the lion's dinner."
"Unknown","01;16;17;11","01;16;59;04","Right? I mean, anticipation is central to cognition. So so we I've only talked about the first three in the list there, but already lots we can talk about what does that mean for a community then? So how does a community gather data, for example? And that might be, you know, through census through through through getting the input of others in the community about some particular issue it requires remembering like remembering requires that that information be kept in some kind of accessible form, some kind of repository of information."
"Unknown","01;17;00;08","01;17;30;03","We can think already of ways that society does does these. Now, we we for example, the Census Bureau collects information, you know, annually and every ten years collects various kinds of information. There's there's financial surveys done every few years. And some of that information is put in repositories that that at least researchers can access for different reasons. But how, you know, how does that how would that differ?"
"Unknown","01;17;30;03","01;17;41;10","How do you how does what we do today how might that differ from if we were really thinking of communities as cognitive organisms, how might we improve on any of these processes? Right."
"Unknown","01;17;43;28","01;18;18;17","I don't know if there's thoughts on that, but I can show you. Steve, Stephen guys. Yeah. I mean, one thing I think that's interesting is this. This actually points as well, though, to an interesting dilemma. I dunno if it's a dilemma, but certainly a challenge in the sense that these artifacts, these artifacts of knowledge that we have, they're kind of we have the option in a community setting to place them in our environment because they aren't, they can be equilibrium based artifacts."
"Unknown","01;18;18;17","01;19;11;10","So for instance, if I create a book and I put it on a shelf, it could be there 100 years, right? And then come back and it's still a book, right? So you've got this ability for that kind of storage. Now when I remember something, I'm actually in France, I'm establishing this kind of fires, an update of fires this is generated on these lower level sensory flux pieces of sorghum which I have at higher levels, potentially started to interpret as what you might call a signal but you get into this interesting question because it is like the error is kind of the signal in active inference, although it's possibly at higher levels of thinking it"
"Unknown","01;19;11;10","01;19;32;23","gets a little bit different because we we've been talking about that with some of the modeling. But there's a there's a there's an interesting question around as you scale our where some of this sense data in active inference is kind of held in the kind of collective notion of a community which knows how to interact, for instance, with the artifacts."
"Unknown","01;19;33;11","01;19;48;20","Yet you've also got aspects a bit like I've got my clothes and I've got other things that are kind of a part of me, are they not? Part of me? They part of the environment. You know, there's I think there's something quite interesting, and I think that's an area I'm really interested in exploring this is teasing that out."
"Unknown","01;19;48;20","01;20;14;12","So I wonder what your thoughts are on that well, part of part of I think part of what you're speaking about might be what I've been calling richness of information, right? So so obviously a census can collect information once a year about, you know, numbers and and education levels and things like that. That's one that's one stream of information, a valid stream of information."
"Unknown","01;20;14;26","01;20;46;29","And yet another is very personal. It's what what is your gut what is your gut telling you about this situation or this, you know, this this constellation of what's happening today? What is your gut feeling of what's happening right so how does that how does a community that, you know, process, sense and process all of that information together, if you have a, you know, if we're a part of the community and we're trying to decide on some issue, it would be good if we heard your gut."
"Unknown","01;20;48;18","01;21;11;14","What is your gut telling you about this? Is this good or bad or is this direction good or bad or, you know, even if even if there's no like data, the data to back it up, what is your sense based on the the your your complexity, your wholeness, your like? We can't even put a word on that, what you what you are or where that information comes from, maybe."
"Unknown","01;21;11;14","01;21;32;14","But what is this? What is the sense that you're having and I would like to share my sense, too, and everyone maybe could share their sense so how do we how do we do that? And how do we do that when there's 100,000 of us? How do we do that? Well, you know, to give just a few thoughts, there's there's two sides to the conversation."
"Unknown","01;21;32;20","01;22;02;16","There's sharing, communicating, and then there's really engaging and listening, which is part of the nature of attention topic. So 100 people speaking over each other is zero conversation. That's not. Yeah, yeah, that's not conversation. Right, exactly. So how do we how do we do that? And I don't think that that's not, you know, like it's almost surprising in a way that that week we have such enormous technical capacity in today's society to do unbelievable things."
"Unknown","01;22;03;06","01;22;39;20","And yet this very basic question of how do we as a community of say 10,000, 100,000, how do we richly share information in a way that all of us feels heard that our that we can express are kind of like hard knowledge and gut knowledge? How do we participate together in describing our situation, describing our fears, describing our uncertainty, anticipating what is going to happen next if we take choice A, B, or C, how?"
"Unknown","01;22;39;28","01;23;01;28","You know, it's kind of interesting that that that that that tool doesn't exist in spite of our technological process. And we might be reasons why that I mean, there may be political reasons and economic reasons why that tool doesn't exist because of that tool did exist. People would want to participate, you know, like naturally I want my story heard."
"Unknown","01;23;01;28","01;23;27;05","I want to I want my community to understand what I know because maybe it's going to help somebody and and I want to hear. But what, you know, in a in a in a healthy conversation, in a healthy exchange, I really want to know what you're thinking and I want to I want to contextualize all this information in light of what our purpose is, what our goal is, what are we after?"
"Unknown","01;23;27;05","01;24;10;09","What do we want right well, I can't comment on that because I think this is a really important point. And and also, though, as well as see, this is what I find, I'm recasting speech as an action policy, as an extended cognition into a spatial landscape of cement six. Right. So effectively, it's actually words could be seen as in a virtual environment that we have projects in our and what that can kind of open up is that when I'm talking to someone and being heard, which basically means the words are being heard, right?"
"Unknown","01;24;10;26","01;24;35;25","So but there's there's certain things that I can't communicate through words because they're not in that semantic landscape, which is the compression of my a useful tool. The thing with tools is generally speaking is it's not very healthy to relate to tools, right? It's like tools are things so nonverbal work can be really powerful. We actually had that with our work with in the community who use alternative communication."
"Unknown","01;24;35;25","01;24;56;14","You know, we really push that. So they it's it can take them 3 minutes to do two, three words because if we're using the head switch and have to scan through each letter and then hit the head switch, and then so we really like how about it not being about the words and it's about being the the look of the eye and that building up of non verbal."
"Unknown","01;24;56;22","01;25;21;12","No, in between people which at some point will probably be well we actually then articulate that through fabric landscapes so then they stop painting the room and do world building and then you start making the words. So there's, there's something about like you said, there may be something that too well we need, we need the tools, but also sometimes tools just can't go there."
"Unknown","01;25;21;17","01;25;45;01","So what do we do where we don't use tools? And then when we bring it into a tool based environment, I think this is a good point. Yeah. Yeah. And I think much of human communication actually happens nonverbally too. If we can be in the same room and I'm watching your facial expressions, I'm getting a lot more information about you and your intent than if we if I was only hearing your voice, if I was only reading your words."
"Unknown","01;25;45;14","01;26;16;29","So sure, there's there's nonverbal communication, there's artistic expression, there's there's poetic expression, you know, using words in a different way. And and obviously, we again, we as an individual, I want to be heard. And if I'm maybe I'm expressing myself in words, maybe I'm expressing myself in my hello, I'm raising my eyebrows. Or maybe I'm maybe I don't even have words to express myself, but I have an image in my head that I want to communicate somehow."
"Unknown","01;26;17;04","01;26;43;10","Somehow we we have to be able to communicate richly and in mass. And how do we do that? And part of the answer to that might be we communicate in smaller groups and that information that is is sort of propagated up the hierarchy or something maybe. I mean, you know, the the the slate is wide open here. So this is the question to the world."
"Unknown","01;26;44;02","01;27;20;22","How can we communicate richly and as such that our purpose like being fulfilled, you know, our, our purpose of of maintaining, achieving and maintaining vitality into the future. Right? So that's the big picture. And then how what are the what are the, what are the many tools are or social norms or educational processes or, you know, any number of things that lead us to fulfilling our purpose, you know, our intrinsic purpose, I should say, you know, our biological purpose in sense by John."
"Unknown","01;27;20;22","01;27;54;25","I hope that people clip that out or hear your question and really consider it. And what it makes me think about on this slide and to return it to active inference again is really like the rhetoric of participation, because in a reward maximization culture, things like communicate, it's like but not now. We have decisions to make. Whereas when we reframe about reducing uncertainty on a multi scale, so individual and shared generative models, it's like we have we communicated enough to even know each other's generative model."
"Unknown","01;27;55;00","01;28;13;29","Because once I know that your generative model includes this dietary restriction, I don't need 100 text messages a day. I actually can generate recipes that are going to be compatible with you. So it's not like we just need to have more communication or a different kind or these two people need to talk or some sort of secret trick."
"Unknown","01;28;14;07","01;28;44;26","It's actually that we can balance a lot of these sometimes locally contradictory needs like choose to. And you could find a situation where they align on this list and you could find a situation or imagine a situation where they diverge and the power comes from being able to have that goal directness and the epistemic gain, and then potentially through peer mentorship or through extended cognitive architecture, we could be able to mark, you know, where is there a yellow flag?"
"Unknown","01;28;44;26","01;29;06;06","Where is there a red flag? Where do we need to pull back and share more about one person's generative model or how are we working as part of an integrated unit that's reducing uncertainty given the preference vector rather than well, if we each just make as much money as possible, then the group will have as much money as possible."
"Unknown","01;29;06;07","01;29;33;01","Right? So this is a different way that we can go about having that conversation. And as hopefully where we're drawing out, it's something where everyone's perspective isn't just a group to be formed, their perspective is their contribution and their value. Yep. Good, good. We can also look to biology, to Horace how does the cells of the body make decisions?"
"Unknown","01;29;33;01","01;30;00;20","You know, like how does a liver know what to do and when to act? How does the heartbeat know when to speed up or slow down? There's rich communication that happens multi scale, some local, some distant through hormones through messengers. There's enormously rich communication that happens between tissues and cells in order for all the pieces to understand what the what what is necessary now."
"Unknown","01;30;01;21","01;30;23;02","Right? So we there's we can, we can this is an open question. It's a clean slate. There's there's great potential for the science world and other communities to move forward of this question of how do we actually communicate and make decisions together? How do we do that? And and there's lots of biological examples for us to look at to gain inspiration from."
"Unknown","01;30;23;21","01;30;45;28","So a question a question from the chat just before Steven from Yvonne, just about the tools. How many people have used the kinds of tools that you're suggesting or it sounds like you suggested that it didn't exist, but what is the preferred field for a startup from Yvonne? Where does this tools where is this coming out of this sort of tool for communication and collaboration?"
"Unknown","01;30;47;01","01;31;19;26","I'm not sure I understand the question exactly where's it coming from? He asked, What is the preferred field to make a startup in this kind of a field? Like, would it be in the field of industrial engineering or. Oh, well, so I have ideas in my head of how we might, you know, start to build such tools and the you know, the reason I'm thinking about it is for this very this very problem of how do you mean?"
"Unknown","01;31;19;26","01;31;47;28","How do communities communicate how if this cloud model were to if we were to move forward with, with studying this cloud model and eventually developing a field trial with a club model, how does communication happen within the cloud model? So that's that's my interest, you know, is is the application to this problem of societal transformation and and demonstrating new ways of of the cognition at the local level, the clubs."
"Unknown","01;31;48;16","01;32;23;10","But obviously, if you had a tool that could do this, there would be tremendous opportunities for others to use the tool to this is just one example out of a thousand you might think of. But and I used to I work in the utility industry and I've seen how messages get transferred from, you know, a caller calls in and says, you know, there was a there's a there's an accident, there's a wire down, there's sparks flying, there's children around you know, there's some kind of rich situation happening that others need to know about."
"Unknown","01;32;23;24","01;32;45;02","And by the time that message gets to the person in the field or in the church, you know, it might be quite garbled. It might be maybe not unclear at all what the problem is or what the dangers are with the situation right. So that would just be one example of how industry might use a tool for better communication."
"Unknown","01;32;47;01","01;33;08;09","And and, you know, there would be many, many more examples you could think of. So I would think my guess would be that if the science community moved forward with this problem of how do you richly communicate with a large group, that those tools and the concepts that would come out of that would be applicable to a to a wide variety of industries."
"Unknown","01;33;08;09","01;33;30;05","And to this particular question of how does the club model work and how do how to communities cognate. Thank you, John. Stephen. And then anyone else with race hands. Yeah, thanks. This this sort of reminds me of some of the principles actually. Systemic coaching can be an interesting area, like looking at coaching groups and the system. It seems to be that."
"Unknown","01;33;31;04","01;33;56;00","And I was just wondering if you've encountered the viable systems model Stafford is viable systems model because I think that some of the active inference work can recast that because you've got not just levels of regulation on, on the body because it's based on the I thing as the body, on the nervous system of a stroke or or different nervous systems."
"Unknown","01;33;56;00","01;34;19;02","But that doesn't necessarily have that bottom up. Teleology that you get from active inference doesn't necessarily have the kind of the idea that the lower level is also no something is tends to be the higher levels of regulation, the lower level. So but that might be something to look at as one area that we're interested in. And yeah, I just thought I'd mention that in case, you know, no go great."
"Unknown","01;34;19;09","01;34;52;23","And you know, those are the kinds of ideas that would you would want to explore as you build with the kind of tools we've been discussing. And on that, on that topic, the goal is not to build one tool that does all of this, right. We could have many tools. We could, you know, different groups could explore a variety of approaches and tools and, and, you know, some depths of simplicity and complexity and, you know, there's room for room for many discussions on this topic."
"Unknown","01;34;52;23","01;35;18;24","Right. And one other just to just to kind of continue with you, the idea of coaching, I've been I've been around enough folks in my life to realize that some groups and some people are really skilled at communicating and talking with others and, you know, getting facilitating group conversation and things like that. And I have met many times."
"Unknown","01;35;18;24","01;35;57;10","I've been just so impressed with the ability of certain groups or certain individuals to to kind of facilitate communication and show by example what healthy communication looks like. And and at the same time, I've watched TV, you know, I've seen TV shows of terrible examples of how to communicate you know, examples of dishonesty and examples of manipulation, examples of holding back, examples of of confusion, you know, examples of shallow, shallow thinking and, you know, social norms."
"Unknown","01;35;57;14","01;36;20;10","Part of this whole process would also be to like the club model. It would be to develop social norms that are useful for the community. Right. That are reinforced to healthy, healthy behaviors or healthy ways of communication, health, healthy skill development, that would help the community to better process the information that happens. Right. So so that kind of coaching is available to it."
"Unknown","01;36;20;16","01;36;53;13","And this is something in the narrative as active inference we talked about. When we see representations of communication like they are upgraded or priors are updated, to think that those types of communication are more likely or that they're prevalent or even that they exist at all. And then we fulfill that prediction by reducing our uncertainty about our own behavior and our own thinking through other minds of other people's behavior, thinking, well, what happens when there's two people and they need to is they want to cut in front and then you're not surprised when they do it, you're not surprised when you do it."
"Unknown","01;36;54;09","01;37;22;22","But there's also a way to show representations of that not happening so that it will not surprise either person when they both slow down and that shows how our intersubjective level of computation is something that is influenced by both the bottom up, you know, the sensory input and the top down. With our cultural scaffolding. So systems in change need to be able to resonate from the small to the large, or there's going to be some pathologies."
"Unknown","01;37;22;23","01;38;00;26","So Stephen. And then any other comments, so this actually could be an interesting or could inform anyway the types of questions that I could pose to Cole first and himself, you know, around some of these practical implications. So we could have these in mind. So I was just thinking, you know, do you have sort of I wonder if you actually have thoughts about all of the holes in this or are there questions around where this whole field of active inference is sort of going in the sort of global sense and whether you thought, oh, I wonder what what how Fiston would think about that?"
"Unknown","01;38;00;27","01;38;29;03","You know, it's just just a question to frame it. Carl, if you're listening, feel free to to join in. No, I would love to. I would love to, you know, be one of the many ways to start this whole process off would be to have a conference where we get together some folks who have experience in these fields in a variety of fields, who could offer their thoughts and cautions and encouragements and whatever they may be."
"Unknown","01;38;29;13","01;39;05;24","Well, we'll try to come on June 21st 20, 21 Carl first and will be joining us for a little symposium. And in another sense we have a nano symposia every week. But any type of logistics or organization that are the enabling architecture is what Active Lab is there for great fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. You know, I might maybe should say too, we've been talking about active inference and obviously all of us who are interested in the topic but you know, it could be that the active inference 2.0 is called something else."
"Unknown","01;39;05;24","01;39;33;09","It goes like we learn something in the next decade or whatever and active inference is no longer, you know, like we've moved beyond that and now we're talking about some other thing. You know what the important aspect of this for us is? How does cognition happen? How does, you know, how how do biological organisms structure themselves? And orient themselves and organize themselves in order to process information?"
"Unknown","01;39;33;09","01;39;55;28","And, you know, how does that work? So whether it's active inference or whether it's you know, something else, sure. Everything evolves. We learn as we go. So it might be next year, it might be a different word, but the concept is how do we achieve and maintain vitality into the future? You know, that's how do we fulfill our purpose."
"Unknown","01;39;56;06","01;40;29;12","And even today for different non English human languages and for computer languages, the word is already not active inference. And so that's why it's always so rewarding and valuable to be very clear on what active inference is, which parts are drawing from Bayesian statistics, from complex systems, from predictive processing, from all of these other areas, instead of thinking that we need to reinvent the wheel because we certainly don't, we're also just a part of the cognitive architecture, and it'll be quite interesting, right?"
"Unknown","01;40;29;12","01;41;02;26","For sure. So maybe in the last 15 minutes of this point one, John, help us via another slide or by raising another salient question, what can we as listeners and participants think about in this next week to kind of simmer during this week between our two sessions OK, OK, maybe next week we'll talk, we'll talk more about you know we've we've only that covered two slide zero we had I think like 60 slides we could have looked at."
"Unknown","01;41;02;26","01;41;30;27","We covered two of them or maybe three of them. But the the the goal here was to talk about part three of the paper which is design. So I think maybe for our listeners, maybe the question of like how would you actually do this? What would in part in part three, I spend some time talking about a prototype called the what I call the leader framework, local economic direct democracy association framework."
"Unknown","01;41;31;13","01;41;55;10","The emphasis there is the concept is a full integrated systems approach, but the emphasis in the simulation trial that I published is on economics. So just take that alone. What would what would a fundamentally different economic system look like? How would it function and how how could it apply to a club model, you know, like implemented at the local level?"
"Unknown","01;41;55;20","01;42;24;13","Well, what might that look like? How and when I say economic, I mean economic slash, financial, slash, monetary, institutional, you know, like all of those things wrapped up into the word economic what how how would that look? What what are the possibilities right. We could we'll go there next minute. Great question. One thought is econ, eco and ecosystem and economy."
"Unknown","01;42;24;13","01;42;53;17","It's like they start with the first three letters. They're so close, they're almost on the right track with an ecological perspective on economics. Yet you add one more letter and the changes from ecology to economics and all of a sudden it's like never the twain shall meet. So it's an awesome question, just rethinking how these different intertwined systems relate, just like intertwined systems in an ecosystem of like primary producers, prey, animals, predators, renewal, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;42;54;03","01;43;14;29","Right, right. So so on that, you know, just to follow that up just a little more, what is an economic system? You know, before we go about designing new ones what what is the purpose of an economic system? We ought to ask that question first before we jump into potential designs. Right? So what is what a what is it supposed to achieve in the first place?"
"Unknown","01;43;15;22","01;43;42;03","And I think for some listeners or for the general population, at least if you ask that question, the answer would be like, good, an economic system is about, you know, allocating resources back and forth, you know, choosing who gets what and and how resources are used but I would argue that that's not at all with an economic system like intrinsically, potentially what an economic system is."
"Unknown","01;43;42;14","01;44;03;26","I would say an economic system is exactly what we've been talking about so far today. It is that it is a cognitive system. It is a it has a different variety of cognitive system that allows a community to coordinate in a slightly different way, like a governance system allows its community coordinate in one way. Legal system allows a community to coordinate in a different way."
"Unknown","01;44;04;02","01;44;31;02","And an economic system allows it to coordinate in a different way. So if so, if the goal is functional societal cognition, what does an economic system look like? What one thought on that and using the bodies intertwined signaling systems like neurological, chemical, et cetera, from the point of view of the ribosome the protein translating machinery, insulin is just another peptide."
"Unknown","01;44;31;10","01;45;05;17","It's just linking the amino acids together and it's making a protein. But to the point of view of a receptor, the insulin molecule is in affordance for binding. And then to the point of view, the downstream signaling cascades inside of the cell, we start to see semantics enter into the picture and then there's a turnover for the insulin and there's lactate being shuttled from the muscles which are using it and there they're calling out for help through these different mechanisms so it's like a cargo ship might be carrying something and it's putting it in a box and it's just moving it like an encrypted message."
"Unknown","01;45;05;17","01;45;32;06","It's just moving the information. It doesn't need the semantics to be able to relay the information. And similarly, when there's these intertwining systems, it's like that one insulin peptide can be handled by a producer, by a transporter, by a signal detector, by a degrading enzyme. And the idea that all of those pieces are, you know, you could just change one out or you could remove one, it wouldn't be the same system as a whole."
"Unknown","01;45;32;23","01;46;06;02","So Stephen, then any other thoughts you're I light the hormone reference as I think that the nature of the hormone system where you you know, the hormone gets released into the blood, let's say the blood and it travels around the body is actually maybe closer to this idea of a message passing kind of signal going out there, you know, sort of sense in sort of a general way, which is and maybe this is something that the economic system does."
"Unknown","01;46;06;02","01;46;25;13","Right is and you can't do that so easily through necessarily just dynamical processes with people where it's like, OK, you can you can kind of infer things, you can sort of build things up. But can you set up a pipeline of value distribution or at least the information in relation to value distribution and how that can be processed."
"Unknown","01;46;25;25","01;46;59;08","And you can release your hormones, which is basically money or budgetary predictions into that system. And it flows, right? It flows around it and it gets picked up and it becomes more like a traditional signal that can be computed and but you can't put out the dynamical system information because it's not a thing. It is dynamical so there's something interesting there, I think around that, that, that analogy to that."
"Unknown","01;47;00;08","01;47;25;00","It's the system, it's the system we're working with to be able to explore how message passing algorithms instrumentally used by us as curious and motivated investigators allow us to act in the world to reduce our uncertainty about blood sugar. So in follow it on that. The question to for the public is what is money? You know, in its best sense, what is money?"
"Unknown","01;47;26;28","01;47;58;21","So we'll try that. We'll try to tackle some of that next week when we meet again. Yep. So just on a closing note, we heard two big questions right there at the end. How can we actually do it? And it would be awesome if people could read especially the third paper in the series and look at the letter framework that John, as a leader that John has proposed and there's a simulation there and it's a scaffold for a lot of rich discussions so on the how can we actually do this, we want to hear many perspectives as well as people's thoughts on the third section of the paper."
"Unknown","01;47;58;29","01;48;22;29","And then the second question, what is money? Which is of course, a fascinating question for history, anthropology, game theory. So many different areas converge on what is money, and it's a system in flux as we see quite literally day to day, depending on how closely you follow crypto. Right. Thank you, everybody, for joining. This has been fantastic. Awesome discussion."
"Unknown","01;48;22;29","01;48;44;16","So everybody who's watching live, thanks so much for participating. And next week in number 21.2, we'll have a follow up discussion with you, John. So thanks again for your engagement and for really giving us this foundation with the multiple precursor videos, because it really helps. And I think this is going to be a great conversation sequence. So peace out, everybody."
"Unknown","01;48;45;03","01;48;49;18","See you later. All right. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye bye bye."
