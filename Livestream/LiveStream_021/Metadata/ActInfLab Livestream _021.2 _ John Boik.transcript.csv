"Speaker 1","00;00;08;27","00;00;43;13","Hello, everyone. Welcome. Thanks for joining active lab. This is live stream number 21.2, I think. And this is our sixth discussion with John. The first four were background discussions where John and I worked through these Jamba boards and through the three part series that John had written, Science Driven Societal Transformation and now here we are today on May 11th, 20, 21 in our second participatory group discussion."
"Speaker 1","00;00;43;13","00;01;07;05","So this is going to be an unpacking and an extension and an opportunity to share perspectives and asked John questions. So thanks to all who have joined live and who will be joining live. And also if you're watching on YouTube, feel free to leave a question in the chat and we will relay that to you. So we're just going to go around with a quick round of introductions."
"Speaker 1","00;01;07;05","00;01;24;20","Maybe each of us could just say hello and something that they're thinking of or something that they're excited to talk about today. And then we will pass back to John and just start off on this road together. So I'm Daniel and I'm in California. I will pass to Lee."
"Speaker 2","00;01;26;29","00;01;54;02","I am Lee. I'm in I'm in London at the minute. And although I'm a Ph.D. researcher at the University of York, John, I'm today, I'm interested to talk about maybe minimum viable prototypes for one of the clubs and also a little bit around the metaphor of the super organism as well. If we have time and I'll pass to Scott, Scott I think."
"Speaker 3","00;01;55;09","00;02;27;13","Thank you. My name is Scott David. I'm at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab, where I'm the director of the Information Risk and Synthetic Intelligence Research Initiative. Delighted to be here today. And I'm also very, very interested in chatting about the scale scale independent variables and how the interventions at one scale can help to alter system performances at other scales."
"Speaker 3","00;02;27;13","00;02;34;20","Do the fractal nature of some of the affordances we're talking about be of great interest? To me, and I'll pass it to Dave."
"Speaker 2","00;02;35;23","00;03;03;28","Dave Douglas, I'm in the Philippines, 120 miles north of Manila, where it's cool because the Mile High City and I just came across the answer to a question What is the state in the parcels and particles paper? Dr. Frist and says a state is a particle so yes it really, really is monads not only all the way up but all the way down to and who's left."
"Speaker 2","00;03;03;28","00;03;06;11","Daniel, you've already we already know you."
"Speaker 1","00;03;07;10","00;03;11;04","We'll go to we'll go to John. Thanks for the spicy introduction."
"Speaker 4","00;03;11;04","00;03;50;17","Dave John Boik mean, Daniel, if you go to sir set to slide one, add this this series, this these numerous talks are on the topic of science driven societal transformation. That's the title of a three part series that I recently published in the journal Sustainability Part one is Worldview. Part two is motivation and strategy and part 33 is design and looking at societal transformation through a particular lens in this series."
"Speaker 4","00;03;51;03","00;04;04;16","And that lens is the de novo development of fundamentally new systems so when I say systems, I'm talking about economic systems, governance systems, legal systems, et cetera."
"Speaker 4","00;04;06;22","00;04;39;16","The we're going to focus today, I think, on maybe some of the practical aspects, like how would this be done? And I would like to just start by saying just a few words about this. The kind of theory of change that I talk about, especially in people remember to be if I were brilliant, which I'm not, and I came up with this amazing new design for societal systems, new governance systems, et cetera, if there were no way to actually practically implement that, then it would have just been an academic exercise."
"Speaker 4","00;04;40;06","00;05;12;03","So part of the series is arguing that there actually is a reasonable way to move forward and a viable path to move forward that is doable, that that actually could be put into into implementation so this the series is is itself is is essentially outlining an R&D program for the development of this framework to study and create and develop and test new integrated systems."
"Speaker 4","00;05;12;24","00;05;36;04","And that happens at according to this theory of change that happens at the at the local level. So the concept is, is that this R&D program is a is a collaboration between the global science community and local communities. And the new systems are implemented at the local level on a volunteer basis in what I call a club model."
"Speaker 4","00;05;36;22","00;06;03;20","So the the concept there is that the scientific community would have developed the tools and technologies and resource some things necessary to make these new systems work well. And they the local communities and volunteer local communities somewhere in the world would, would look at the results of all the computer simulations and all the studies that have been done and say that looks interesting."
"Speaker 4","00;06;04;07","00;06;28;01","Gee, it looks like our community might really benefit from this let's give it a field trail, let's give it a try it. And so that's the partnership and then the community itself. Now, this could be I don't mean a city I don't mean a nation. I really mean like perhaps a subset of a city. So say just a thousand people or something like that might be enough to start a club."
"Speaker 4","00;06;28;27","00;06;57;07","And the club would function. Everyone in the club would function as normal in society, except that on top of on top of this, another layer of organization, on top of the normal layer of organization, and that's this club level. So civic club, you can you can think of it as a civic club and the civic club has all these, you know, ways that they go by decision making and exchanging currencies."
"Speaker 4","00;06;57;07","00;07;20;21","And various things that allow them then to test out these new frameworks of, of societal systems. So that's the gist of it. And I just want to say a few things about this club model before we really could go into so we're kind of all on the same page on that but just before I do that, maybe go to slide two of that same deck."
"Speaker 4","00;07;21;10","00;07;55;03","I'll point people to principle societies project dot org. If they're looking for more information on this. The all of our videos are posted there and the papers are posted there and some other materials posted there. So for for information, go to PSP and let's go to slide 17 OK, oh, that is not the right book. Quite the right one."
"Speaker 4","00;07;55;03","00;08;01;02","I wanted the theory of change you want and that's not it."
"Speaker 1","00;08;02;09","00;08;03;13","There are different strategies."
"Speaker 4","00;08;05;28","00;08;07;02","Which slide that you're looking at."
"Speaker 1","00;08;07;12","00;08;08;27","17 on."
"Speaker 4","00;08;09;15","00;08;09;20","To."
"Speaker 2","00;08;10;00","00;08;10;09","Yep."
"Speaker 4","00;08;13;04","00;08;35;10","Theory of change. Well that's somehow I'm. Oh there we go yes things change and strategy so this is just kind of capturing what I just said. The idea is to implement new fundamentally new systems at the club level."
"Speaker 4","00;08;37;10","00;09;01;02","I'll call the club community, but this community could be relatively small and just a portion of the city. And the reason and one of the reasons I'm looking at the club level is because I see it as kind of the Goldilocks level. It's the it's the smallest size organization of a community that could make the club a able to replicate."
"Speaker 4","00;09;01;08","00;09;32;07","Right. And function. So if that if we were instead just looking at, say, an individual business that business like I say, say I was promoting a cooperative business model or something like that, that business would have to function within the wider set of businesses and would have to compete in the normal market for the consumers attention. And it would have a hard time doing that because it's operating according to some different set of rules than a normal business."
"Speaker 4","00;09;33;07","00;09;51;20","So at the club level, I see that as just large enough that all of these new functional systems can be tested and and it's large enough that that the organization, the community can be self-replicating, the club model can be self-replicating, it can grow in a local area and the idea can spread to other local areas."
"Speaker 4","00;09;55;27","00;09;58;14","Right now. Slide 19, please."
"Speaker 1","00;09;59;04","00;10;05;04","Can we just go in just completely and then, Scott, just because we're getting hands raised on each of these slides. So yeah. So then Scott."
"Speaker 2","00;10;05;07","00;10;05;19","Sure."
"Speaker 2","00;10;07;22","00;10;19;08","That's. John. What are the in order to start a club, what are the minimum requirements that are needed? Does it need any funding or there are the set of conditions that it might need."
"Speaker 4","00;10;21;27","00;10;47;12","Ideally there wouldn't be any requirements. Ideally, there would be support from the from the, you know, the global community to start a club. But but but the but the clubs are designed such or at least I would later we'll see. Today, we'll talk about a simulation I did of a book club model. The particular framework I called the leader framework, but I designed that so that it could bootstrap its own growth."
"Speaker 4","00;10;47;15","00;11;13;23","So there was no that was not necessary to you know, for for to have millions of dollars, say to start the club or anything like that. It really just grew step by step exponentially faster. So in the first few years, hardly anything was happening. And then it started to grow very rapidly after that. So, you know, what would be necessary?"
"Speaker 4","00;11;13;23","00;11;36;05","Mostly just individuals that are that look at the that by the time I feel trial would ever be started, there would have been, you know, let's say hundreds of papers, scientific papers on simulations and all other aspects of this. So everyone would know what they're getting into. This would be very clear what the what the you know, what the new systems are and what they do, how they function."
"Speaker 4","00;11;37;11","00;11;55;27","And then at that point, all it would really be necessary is for some entity, somewhere in the world to say, well, it looks really interesting. Let's do a field trip you know, here's we have a thousand people in our little in our community that are interested in this and let's give it a shot. So that's the main thing. I mean, maybe a little bit of funding would be necessary, but not an extreme amount."
"Speaker 1","00;11;56;17","00;12;17;09","So it sounds it sounds almost like there's a prelude phase, which is the what we're in. And then the stage will be set for proper emergence for a community to then take that next step. But it's a really interesting question about the viable system. So I hope that we pursue that line as well. Yeah. John, anything else?"
"Speaker 4","00;12;17;19","00;12;40;02","And I just maybe will add that by the time the first field trial ever starts, there really should be no surprises about any of this. I mean, the community would, you know, conduct the trial, but it should be a foregone conclusion what's going to happen as far as how it works and what the benefits are, because this should have been worked out very well already."
"Speaker 4","00;12;40;02","00;13;04;26","So, you know, it shouldn't be it's not like here's a you know, here here's a new here's a new machine tractor or something. Now see if you can drive it. It's not quite like that because there would be, you know, training involved. We would realize what the purpose of the tractor is, what we're going to accomplish with the tractor, how how it works how you repair it."
"Speaker 4","00;13;05;12","00;13;25;26","You know, like there would be a again, there's just it'll be very few surprises by the time the first field trials gets. That doesn't mean the community wouldn't be able to make decisions on how it what it funds and how it functions. Of course, the community would make decisions about how about its the kinds of jobs it creates and things like that."
"Speaker 4","00;13;26;26","00;13;32;03","But the fundamental mechanics mechanics of the system should be pretty well worked at."
"Speaker 1","00;13;32;29","00;13;34;28","Daily any other. It's also not just."
"Speaker 2","00;13;36;04","00;13;48;05","It just very quickly, you know, so if the it's a particular community. So you've got this prelude phase where you're kind of working out all the details of that, you know, the design, is that done with the community? Oh, certainly."
"Speaker 4","00;13;48;06","00;14;16;11","I mean, that would be with any communities like globally. In a sense, the prelude part is the global science community and any the vigils or communities anywhere in the world that want to participate, provide feedback, do user testing, you know, so all of the little parts of the systems would be also tested in various groups. And there would be, you know, like really just a ton of testing that would occur before the before the first formal field trial ever started."
"Speaker 4","00;14;17;09","00;14;52;06","And and that particular community would could have input on, you know, what kind of particular design elements it might want in its system. So and that's actually a good point. I'm glad you said that, because I also wanted to say that the the purpose of this R&D program is not to build one system that fits all. It's to build it's an ongoing exploration of the you know, different pieces and approaches and ways you might create systems such that they fulfill their purpose."
"Speaker 4","00;14;52;19","00;15;20;05","So there could be a wide variety of, you know, parts to choose from or ways to do things or, you know, hopefully there would be numerous kinds and types and pieces of systems that would be tested over time that communities could, you know, implement them. And all with the purpose of you know, fit for purpose, you know, always with the concept of fit, fit for purpose behind this."
"Speaker 1","00;15;21;19","00;15;23;23","Scott And then anyone else who raises their hands."
"Speaker 3","00;15;25;18","00;15;44;16","I just wanted to go back. You were talking a little bit about the size of groups in the clubs. It's the optimization is going to be really interesting because you might have an Dunbar's number involved there, that Dunbar's number concept being the most people you can have as your friend kind of idea. So whatever is 120 or something."
"Speaker 3","00;15;44;16","00;16;05;13","But one of the things that's interesting also you have the internal voice dynamics of the club plus the external voice dynamics of the club. So as the club cohere as an internal voice, it will have a more coherent external voice which will allow it to in train and harmonically couple other systems more effectively. Right because it be more coherent."
"Speaker 3","00;16;05;25","00;16;33;12","One of the things that I'd like to get into later in the conversation is we have some ideas we've been working on, on scaling how legislative, judicial and executive function. The three functions of all governance systems have rule making enforcement of the rules and operation of the rules. How those naturally later on, just as a function of scale, as you increase in scale from rulemaking, you have to go into different abstractions for enforcement and operation under those rules."
"Speaker 3","00;16;34;02","00;17;08;29","And so that's it would be very interesting to look at the dynamics of club growth as an internal process of internal voice and a recognition of the layering on of governance that occurs internally, and then how that governance then needs to expand into the external environment in order to be more effective. The bottom line is if you have a system, a club where we say we are the Free Speech Club, we have the rights to free speech and there's no other club that has a duty to respect that, then you don't have a right to free speech outside of the club."
"Speaker 3","00;17;10;09","00;17;20;05","Right. And so how do you iterate this story outside of the club so that it becomes a reality that's shared so it can be enjoyed? Right, right. I but to talk about that."
"Speaker 4","00;17;20;17","00;17;48;16","Yeah, you know, there's there's a there's a ton there that we can go through. I have this concept in mind as I was designing these systems or designing the framework. So all good points. Just a little bit on size. I'll try to talk about a couple of things briefly that you raised a little bit on size so so in our brains, we have a community of neurons that are that are functioning to help the body make decisions."
"Speaker 4","00;17;48;16","00;18;23;23","And that that community of neurons is very much connected with the rest of the body, also feet and the liver and the heart and everything else. So how does all of that you know, how does how do all those cells and tissues and organisms cooperate right together to make the body function the way the body functions? One thing that happens is there's a very rich stream of communication that is passing between all these different cells and tissues and things or signals or small molecule signals and blood is circulating."
"Speaker 4","00;18;23;23","00;19;02;11","And there's all these this awash in signals of communication. So communication is one of the prerequisites for any kind of large organized, you know, set of individuals, whether they're cells or whether they're people to function together. So one of the questions that we can talk about today is what kinds of tools are necessary to allow for rich communication to occur in, say, a group of, let's just say, 10,000 people or 100,000 people or a million people?"
"Speaker 4","00;19;02;19","00;19;30;27","How do how does a large group of people come together richly communicate their narrative their story? They're they're both you know, I want to tell I want to tell my group what is happening for me, what I anticipate will happen if we choose A over B, over C, where this might lead and the short run where this might lead in the long run, how this fits into other issues, issues D and E and F."
"Speaker 4","00;19;31;08","00;20;09;17","I mean, you know, I'm an intelligent person that everyone else has intelligence and that intelligence can be used in the group, the cognitive, you know, the group cognition in order for the group to make wise choices about, you know, actions and and where they want to put their attention. So so the tool question is a big one. And I would say that that currently there are no tools that allow a large group of individuals to come together to collaborate and to be a rich communication and rich storytelling."
"Speaker 4","00;20;09;29","00;20;31;28","Right. It doesn't exist yet, I would say, and I have ideas on how we might create that. But that's one of the that's one of the one of the tasks that would have to happen over the over the first several years of the program is addressing that particular problem. Of how does a group richly communicate and collaborate in making decisions."
"Speaker 4","00;20;32;17","00;20;49;27","So so if we're just talking to get to your point now, if we just have a small group and we're just talking, we're working out things, we're making decisions together, well, maybe that group can't be more than a few people before it starts to fall apart or, you know, maybe it can't be more than ten or 20 or 100 people or something."
"Speaker 4","00;20;51;09","00;21;11;28","But if we have some way to richly communicate, then maybe we can scale that, you know, we can scale that communication to a larger group, to thousands or ten thousands. And still there might be some limit beyond what a club wouldn't, you know, like maybe a club should never be more than a hundred thousand or never. More than a million are never more than 10,000, you know, who knows?"
"Speaker 4","00;21;12;17","00;21;37;27","And so that's between lots of individuals in a club and then there should be similar communication between clubs that must happen and that's getting to a that's touching. Another point that you raised is how do how does a club reach reach the, you know, interact with the wider world and the, the both in the my framing both with other clubs."
"Speaker 4","00;21;38;13","00;21;47;06","How how does decision making occur between clubs? How does communication happen between clubs? And then also how does communication happen with the rest of the world."
"Speaker 1","00;21;47;15","00;21;55;25","Right. And Sean, Stephen and then Scot and then anyone else who raises their hand yeah."
"Speaker 5","00;21;55;25","00;22;42;09","Thanks. I think I'm interested by this the word purpose. You know, we think about purpose and we're this and clubs tend to have a particular focus or purpose, as you're mentioning and think it's interesting you're bringing in the science intentionality, you know, the intentionality of the science community to enable sort of seeding. So I'm wondering how that might you might think about that sitting alongside, say, community organizations or like community hubs, for instance, or multi-service agencies in the community or nodes of support, those types of things."
"Speaker 5","00;22;43;21","00;23;02;27","This might be something which could fit in there and give this kind of lab purpose that might complement or is it different, similar to some of those types of service provisions that exist out in the towns and cities."
"Speaker 4","00;23;03;24","00;23;34;12","I'm not exactly sure the question you're pointing to, but let me say a few things and maybe I'm going to touch on it. Uh, so, so kind of in the, in the abstract, the, the, you know, the concept behind this whole program is that, um, that, that an organism has an intrinsic purpose and that intrinsic purpose is to thrive both now and in the future."
"Speaker 4","00;23;34;12","00;23;59;00","So expected, thriving and it in order to do that, it uses cognition, right? And via cognition. And we've talked about how active inference fits in to that whole picture, the cognition. It really reduces the uncertainty about its capacity to thrive. It's the essential variables that, you know, that it that it needs, that it functions, the world it functions in."
"Speaker 4","00;23;59;00","00;24;35;04","And whether it's need true needs will be met. Right? So that's an organism. And I'm viewing a society as an organism, right? So in the sort of the larger picture, the abstract, the little abstract, the, the question is, you know, is, is a community functioning in a way, is a new system functioning in a way that is reducing uncertainty about the capacity to thrive so that's that's that would be that would be, you know, implemented in a way via some kind of fitness metrics."
"Speaker 4","00;24;35;19","00;24;54;13","So just like a normal society and regular society, we have, say, BP and other various types of, you know, information we gather and metrics that we use. There would be a set of metrics that would go along with this whole program so that a community would know how it's doing and how it would how it can expect to be doing."
"Speaker 4","00;24;54;20","00;25;45;16","Two years from now and five years from now, ten years from now, you know, maybe even 20 years from now. So so there may be many subgroups within say that say that there's a club and the club has 10,000 people, for example. Clearly there would be subgroups within that club that would be interested in various aspects of, you know, of topics or ways of doing things where various kinds of communication and you know, maybe some, some subgroups are really focused on the social components, the community components, the, the, you know, maybe emotional components, social components, and then other groups are interested in technical components and modeling or whatever."
"Speaker 4","00;25;45;16","00;26;08;20","You know, other groups are interested in the environmental components. For example, well, that's great. That's, you know, association between groups is a part of cognition. Our neurons associate in in ways that allows for cognition of the whole. And in the same way, a, you know, a club and a community would do the same. So there could be all kinds of subgroups that are all functioning."
"Speaker 4","00;26;08;20","00;26;49;23","But the umbrella purpose, would it be present? Right. Because it would be reported daily, say, or even hourly or weekly, you know, there would be everyone would know how how we're doing as a whole and that we're all in this together to raise our our joint capacity to thrive and maintain or maintain our ability to thrive. So, yes, it would be all kinds of groups that would focus on different aspects of this and of the umbrella you know, recording and collecting of information would be happening still across groups across the community so that there would be some sense of how are we doing and what's going to happen next."
"Speaker 5","00;26;50;22","00;27;36;02","Got you. Can I just reply slightly to that? Yeah, just focusing on that. Just that's really interesting. It sounds as well this could tie in with the kind of another type of evaluative capacity or ongoing role in evaluative capacity. But with an agent based or active inference based engine, so to speak, so that it's giving this update to communities around how they are progressing, so to speak, when that may help them in other areas, some of which may be outside of the club, more bounded area, you know, gets into the nation complexity."
"Speaker 5","00;27;36;17","00;27;49;15","So the interesting if you thought about this might be how this might link in with some of the new developments in evaluative evaluation going on. And that might be quite a good avenue."
"Speaker 4","00;27;50;02","00;28;07;14","Yeah, there would be. I mean, if you were going to collect information and and assess how we're doing and what's going to happen next, there would be all kinds of evaluation that would have to occur not just on the simple things like you could think of some simple things right off the bat, like do we have enough food?"
"Speaker 4","00;28;07;18","00;28;37;17","Do we have enough water? Well, fine. But humans are complex organisms. We have complex needs, social needs, you know, emotional needs. You know, like physical needs. You know, we and all of those needs should be taken into account in some kind of, you know, comprehensive evaluation of how are we doing then what's going to happen next? And and obviously, every any organism has to know that, you know, every organism wants to know it needs to assess its status."
"Speaker 4","00;28;37;17","00;28;49;13","Like how am I, how am I doing? Am I too cold? Am I too hot, am I happy, unhappy? Am I happy that, like, every organism needs to do that? And a community a community as an organism needs to do that."
"Speaker 1","00;28;51;10","00;29;16;25","Too. Thanks, John. Also, welcome, Blue. And on the Goldilocks note and this narrative note, I really like what Scott had said about the internal and external communications and as internal communications become structured from a connections perspective, but also from a narrative perspective, the external interfaces and narratives can be structured. So Goldilocks doesn't just evoke the sort of upside down U-curve."
"Speaker 1","00;29;16;26","00;29;38;27","I mean, this is something that we know from pharmacology, from temperature everything. There's too much and there's too little, and there's a failure mode on either side, just like a bowling alley. And of course, the middle solution is going to be better. It just wears the middle. But Goldilocks also reminds us that that middle solution has to be more like a child's story rather than some sort of abstruse optimization problem."
"Speaker 1","00;29;39;06","00;29;49;01","So it's kind of a fun reference that it should be comprehensible internally and also externally in order to be functional right."
"Speaker 4","00;29;49;07","00;30;24;20","Right, right. That's so, yeah. And maybe just a touch on that. You know, from this to say the scientific viewpoint, one might think about fitness, you know, in terms of metrics and statistics and things like that. But other people won't relate maybe some much to that. Kind of assessment. So everyone who's involved has to there has to be the way to communicate the ideas of how are we doing and, you know, what is our status in ways that are meaningful to everyone involved or else if it's not meaningful, it really won't work."
"Speaker 4","00;30;24;20","00;30;59;17","Right. So so some some people might might discuss in status in very technical terms and other people might discuss status and more, say, emotional terms or social terms or something like that. But but the general sense, the general the general purpose has to make sense to everyone else. Why you're part of this, one of the thing on the Goldilocks is the question is it to be clear, it's not my intent that a club say a club started in Houston, Texas with a thousand people."
"Speaker 4","00;30;59;24","00;31;36;28","It's not my intent that the club would stay at a thousand people. It would grow. If the whole concept of this is that if this this new model, this new club model these new frameworks actually work, if they actually empower a community to do better, to to be more secure or to have a higher quality of life, to have economic security, to, you know, in numerous ways, if if these clubs benefit the population the way I think it would then they would grow because it's kind of like the you know, why don't we use typewriters anymore?"
"Speaker 4","00;31;36;28","00;32;06;23","Because we have computers does that work so much better? I mean, they're just so much better. Who would want to use a typewriter, you know, that kind of thing. So that's the concept of this. It should be so easy to join a club it's so easy to participate in that, that, like, why not? Like, it would be better if I participate in the club and if that's if that comes true, if it really works as advertised, then clubs will grow and the club model will spread to other places."
"Speaker 4","00;32;06;23","00;32;31;05","And then instead of having a club of 10,000 or 1000, you have a club of 100,000 and every city has a club. And pretty soon the, you know, much of the world is starting to function along these, you know, with these, with this, along with these new systems, much of the world is engaging with them or enough of the world is engaging with them that the ideas behind them suddenly become the start to become the dominant ideas."
"Speaker 4","00;32;32;17","00;32;39;23","So the goal is not to help the community so much. The goal is to actually transform globally society or at least semi globally."
"Speaker 1","00;32;40;21","00;32;59;29","Thanks, John. I'm going to ask a question from the chat and then Stephen and Lee. So in the chat, Natalia writes, I read in the paper, thanks for reading the paper, Natalia, that people would keep their income when not working. I'm curious what role motivation plays in the success of the system and what kinds of structures are in place to manage that?"
"Speaker 1","00;32;59;29","00;33;11;08","So agents level motivations and how do we design incentive structures and ecosystems for participation that are able to incentivize various kinds of participants?"
"Speaker 4","00;33;12;03","00;33;34;05","All right. OK, so so what what you know, what motivates us today in our economy you know, a variety of things. We're complex organisms were motivated by a variety of things, but largely because of the way the system is designed is that if you don't participate, if you don't go out there and get some kind of jobs, you're going to be in the street."
"Speaker 4","00;33;34;11","00;34;01;22","You know, there's this like this kind of, you know, you're forced to participate. And if you don't and if you don't, you're going to be in trouble. Well well, that's not very useful. For many reasons. Our more useful is to offer people what they actually really want, what what humans tend to really want, which is a variety of things."
"Speaker 4","00;34;01;22","00;34;23;13","They want to help each other. They want to be part of a community. They want to learn. They want to develop skills. They want to do any number of things that engage them with each other. And they want to solve problems. They want to be a part of a problem solving process. They want they want to you know, cooperate."
"Speaker 4","00;34;23;27","00;34;53;12","It makes us happy to cooperate. And all of nature is cooperating like this. Cooperation is the rule rather than the the exception in nature. So how can we build a system that just allows us to really be ourselves, to really get to what we want most work, right? Like I want to be in a in a kind and cooperative and full missional setting a group."
"Speaker 4","00;34;53;12","00;35;15;00","I want to work with each other. I want to work with the people around me and help each other and they want to help me. And so how do we make that happen at scale? Right. That's the question. And so the motivation isn't to get rich. I mean, we'll talk about the leader framework in a little while. And that's just one example of a way to organize an economic system."
"Speaker 4","00;35;15;00","00;35;39;24","But but that particular system actually achieves income equality over time. So clearly the motivation isn't to make money. Like, that's not why you're engaged in the economic system. The economic system is only a it's really a it's a cognitive system, not a not a money system. Money is just a tool that's used as a as a way to share information."
"Speaker 4","00;35;39;24","00;35;52;07","Right. So in the in the lead a framework, incomes equalize over time. And the motivation to engage is to be to fulfill all these deeper human needs that we all have."
"Speaker 1","00;35;54;13","00;35;57;12","Thanks for the response, John. So Stephen and then Lee."
"Speaker 5","00;36;01;02","00;36;27;21","Yeah, I'll just sort of carrying on a bit from what you're just saying there with this the community getting involved and the benefits to the purpose and to their motivation at the community level, that is a missing link at the moment in terms of and it probably was much more present even 100 years ago. 80 years ago, you'd have had the Women's Institute and you had all sorts of different."
"Speaker 5","00;36;27;29","00;37;06;24","So we professionalize an awful lot of roles and you see that with nursing in all sorts of professions where they've increasingly professionalized and trained so the question I've got there is how do you bring in the motivations of the professionals who have another niche that they're trying to optimize around, maybe writing papers, getting the career and things like this and do they have to be humble in some way to honor the input from this community?"
"Speaker 5","00;37;07;16","00;37;33;24","Because obviously you're trying to invert some of the assumptions about where everything should be located, i.e., it doesn't need to all be driven by professions just keep driving more and more professions that you can bring in community input and wisdom to also be part of that in these clubs. But how do you marry the types of niches that people are in and the competition for their time and."
"Speaker 4","00;37;37;01","00;38;07;29","I don't I don't actually see that as too much of a problem. Let's just let's just pick a profession, say nursing or something like that. And the question becomes, well, let's say that I live in Houston and the club has started. Then why would I want you? I'm a professional I make a reasonable salary, let's say, why would I want to participate in a club well, there might be numerous reasons why I might see I might understand the potential of the club."
"Speaker 4","00;38;07;29","00;38;31;19","I mean, you know, there's this whole body of literature now, these simulations and other literature that suggests that this club model might actually empower the people who belong to a club to make better decisions to achieve, you know, higher environmental quality and higher social quality. So I might be interested just to join for that reason, because I see it as a beneficial thing for the larger community."
"Speaker 4","00;38;31;28","00;38;58;01","I can engage with these people and make decisions, and together we can, you know, make beautiful things happen. But let's now let's focus just on the economic aspect. And again, you know, there might be any number of ways to design any of these systems, economic systems, governance systems, you know, there could be all kinds of concepts that we that that the R&D program could assess and try and test out."
"Speaker 4","00;38;58;01","00;39;29;10","Right. But all of that in the lead a framework the kind of prototypical economic system that we hopefully be talking about here and the question becomes how do we get from here to there? Like how do we get from today's society and incomes and structure to some other structure, you know, down the road? Right. So I try to show that in this simulation, that model that I published it goes over a 30 year period."
"Speaker 4","00;39;29;10","00;39;59;06","So so again, that kind of the expansion of the club and its activities is exponential. So maybe in the first few years there's not a whole lot happening as people join, but you know, there's not big effects. But then these bootstraps itself economically and otherwise, and then they're starting to be bigger effects. So, you know, just kind of jumping to the chase a little bit in the lead a framework, it's designed so that incomes rise over time."
"Speaker 4","00;39;59;10","00;40;26;24","Right. And the and the the people in the simulation, people only join if they're going to be better off economically. Otherwise, there's no reason to join in this election. So I, I, let's say I'm a nurse I have a pretty good income. Why would I join? Well, if I join at any point, it's I will get a pay like again and my income is high."
"Speaker 4","00;40;26;24","00;40;50;29","The, let's say the in the lowest the target income is rising, but my income is still higher than that. I can still join and I'll get a kind of a I'll get a small a small bonus. That's not the word I used in the paper, but it's kind of like that I'll get I'll get a say what. Let's just say $1,000 a year for joining."
"Speaker 4","00;40;51;03","00;41;13;06","Well that's $1,000 a year that I didn't have otherwise. So even I get even though my income is high relative to where this income target is growing, I still get a benefit from it. And then I get to use that money and that, you know, part of it is a is a local currency. So I get to use the dollar, dollar currency, the national currency and this local currency and the decision making process."
"Speaker 4","00;41;13;06","00;41;31;23","And I'm engaged in I have I have some skin in the game now. And then as that income rises, at some point it's likely to reach mine or go above what my current income is. And then for sure, I want to join because if I join my income, you know, like my annual income is going to rise maybe substantially."
"Speaker 4","00;41;32;15","00;42;09;08","So in the in the simulation, the income target rises up to about somewhere around 100 and the equivalent of about $110,000 per year. Per family. So, you know, that's more than some nurses make, and especially for those nurses that are at the bottom level, bottom economic level or teachers or firemen or police or whatever, you know, the there would be motivation to join because your income is going to not only increase but become stable like you don't have to work if you lose your job, there's no work."
"Speaker 4","00;42;09;11","00;42;18;29","And so you're going to be taken care of. The system is circulating currency in such a way that once you're in, you're OK. Doesn't matter if you're working or not."
"Speaker 1","00;42;20;03","00;42;37;25","It it's John, it's a way to rethink this driven by money versus not driven by money because you've really set it both ways. You've said people are not motivated by money, yet you've repeatedly appealed to the idea that every person will gain more money and implicitly that that's what is important. And so it's actually just it is what it is."
"Speaker 1","00;42;38;05","00;42;54;14","And that's where active inference and all these other techniques and extended cognition come into play. Because there'll be a variety of narratives for people who are in different positions. So we'll go to Lee and then Scott, and then I'll ask a question in the chat yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;42;54;14","00;43;16;25","So it's kind of a related point actually. So in the paper, I remember you were reading that at one point. You're talking about, you know, effectively that, you know, those systems start to outcompete the native system. You know, there are going to be winners and losers effectively. So, you know, if you're a franchise owner of a McDonald's or something, you know, your neighbor disappeared."
"Speaker 2","00;43;17;16","00;43;38;22","So on a larger scale, right. That means that you know that and. Well, I guess what I'm what I'm I'm asking is, do you anticipate that ultimately the current system, you know, with lots of vested interest to remain the way it is, it's going to start pushing back once you realize that this kind of club model is potentially a threat to it?"
"Speaker 4","00;43;39;14","00;44;05;13","Yeah. So right. So it's true. There's winners and losers in this. And the and in a sense, if if if you're measuring winners and losers, why does this civilization survive and thrive? Well, then there's hardly any losers because you know that. Yeah, the whole concept of this is so that societies and civilization can thrive into the future. Right."
"Speaker 4","00;44;05;25","00;44;29;13","And that's not and you know, just as a counterpoint, that's not our current system. You know, we're our current system is essentially on a suicide route, you know, trajectory of destroying life on the planet. So the current system is not working. You know, it's not working in the sense of insecurity about will we even be here in 100 years?"
"Speaker 4","00;44;29;13","00;44;53;08","Is is quite high. Right? So but but in a in another sense, yes, there will be losers and winners. So the idea is that that this R&D program is creating testing new ways of organizing society that really do that really function well. And any organism that functions well is going to outcompete other organisms, you know, that are not functioning well in that sense."
"Speaker 4","00;44;53;19","00;45;23;24","So a community say that is using these tools and using these systems and it's really flourishing it probably will be doing flourishing more than other communities that are. And that's the reason that other communities might say, hey, that looks good, but let's do that. Now you have a subset of, say, you know, multi-millionaires and billionaires, and at least on some perspective, they will be losers because you know that that's not going to work."
"Speaker 4","00;45;23;24","00;45;47;22","That's not going to be compatible with this new way of doing things. And you raised one of the reasons why it wouldn't be compatible is that where are they going to get their low wage workers to work in, you know, work in their factories and stuff? Where are they going to come from if all the other folks are having high wage jobs in these new you know, these new systems."
"Speaker 4","00;45;47;22","00;46;11;18","Right. These new frameworks. So the the the business model will start to falter. The conventional business model will start to start to falter. And as it should, because, you know, what what are we what are we doing here? What is the what are we doing in society? Right. Don't we want to flourish? Don't we want systems that help us to to reduce our uncertainty and flourish into the future?"
"Speaker 4","00;46;11;18","00;46;50;19","Well, I would think we do overall. Right. So systems that don't do that really have to fall by the wayside or transform themselves into into new systems that do function better. And the the long term aim of this R&D program isn't necessarily that the world will be using these kinds of systems. It's another option. Other, you know, control future is that current governance systems current legal systems, current financial systems, you know, all of our current systems might learn from these experience, these experiments everywhere and go, you know what, that's that's actually a good idea."
"Speaker 4","00;46;50;19","00;47;10;09","That works well. Let's incorporate that into our structure and you know, we'll be better off. Everyone will be better off. So that would be fun. Maybe that maybe the clubs grow to a point around the world and they just the ideas just assimilate out into the larger world that are taken up and then everyone is still doing better."
"Speaker 4","00;47;10;09","00;47;32;03","And so that would be great. Or maybe it doesn't go that way. Maybe, maybe it becomes, you know, like us against them in a sense. There's the clubs that are growing the the native systems, the current systems are not doing well. They refuse to learn from these experienced experiments. They're not interested in change. Well, then they probably will be dinosaurs, you know?"
"Speaker 2","00;47;33;04","00;47;55;11","I mean, I'm just thinking about, you know, so there are examples of a community energy generation for example. So those connections start to exist. You know, then there are examples of the vested interests where they kind of see that as a potential threat, a move to outlaw them. So, I mean, it's just those kind of, you know, if they kind of conflict around wondering where they might be."
"Speaker 4","00;47;55;20","00;48;22;25","And, you know, of course, those kinds of conflicts will happen. And the and the R&D program and the people involved in trading this whole system have to think these things through carefully to try to avoid, you know, problems that might be foreseen. Right. Obviously. So these are very important questions. And and we would have to give a lot of thought as to how we, you know, skirt past these problems."
"Speaker 4","00;48;23;06","00;48;43;18","Well, now, you know, and I you know, I don't that's to be done. That's work to be done. Right. I have a few ideas and that's an eye. And I can say that's one of the reasons I wanted the global science community as a kind of, you know, a co-leader in this whole process, because it is for one thing, it's global, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;48;43;18","00;49;05;19","It's not limited to the laws of a particular nation. So and it's authoritative in the sense that we can write papers and we can do simulations and we can talk with some authority of would this be a good you know, do these things help humans? Would this be good for human societies and civilization? You know, we can we can we can do that."
"Speaker 4","00;49;05;19","00;49;28;04","We can we're independent of any particular nation. And that's and and then suppose that there's a nation that says, no way, this is against the law. You can't do it here. Well, OK, we can't do it there. But there will be other nations that have those rules. And this club model can thrive wherever it's allowed to thrive. Right."
"Speaker 4","00;49;28;08","00;49;58;01","And you would think that there would be some nation somewhere in this world where there might be some allowance for these kinds of social experiments to occur. And once it works, that's the thing that's the concept is that once it's shown to work, you know, first in one community, say, and then maybe in two and then four in the need to, you know, once it's once it looks like this actually works then there's a whole other slew of of papers and simulations showing, you know, like we're assessing that."
"Speaker 4","00;49;58;13","00;50;15;01","And that information is broadcast to the world and, you know, at some point it becomes harder and harder for a society to to keep it out because, you know, no no no country uses typewriters anymore, you know."
"Speaker 1","00;50;16;22","00;50;18;15","Except the hipster countries."
"Speaker 4","00;50;19;08","00;50;23;15","So we have except the accept the accept the hipsters."
"Speaker 1","00;50;23;29","00;50;29;23","They'll say, I want that good old fashioned government. So Scott and then a question from chat and then Dave."
"Speaker 3","00;50;32;06","00;50;56;22","So great conversation. Thank you. This is so fascinating. So the couple of book references and the things we want to talk a little bit about money and risk here. So going back to what we were talking about a little while ago and that moved from money and prosperity, you know, there's a book by I think it's has been called Doing Money where the author suggests that money is a universal risk consolidator."
"Speaker 3","00;50;57;28","00;50;59;26","And so I'll hold up here."
"Speaker 1","00;51;02;15","00;51;03;10","20 billion."
"Speaker 3","00;51;04;17","00;51;28;04","Could be due to the bearer upon. Right. So it only is as good as the narrative, right? So I always carry Zimbabwean money around because that's inflation protected in the United States that you can't get near the inflation rate. So the reason to raise that is money. You know, we there's a book called The Past is a foreign country where we think people in the past, though, they just didn't get it."
"Speaker 3","00;51;28;21","00;51;48;06","And then we look at this and go, you know, money actually, it's interesting when people want to accumulate money, there's a lot of theories of money. This Smith in Switzerland. Hume But money is a form of communication between peoples in encoding of risk in the sense is what we look at in decoding risk and a universal risk encoding in a sense."
"Speaker 3","00;51;48;17","00;52;10;10","And it's kind of interesting because then it becomes abstracted into its own, its own end. That's when it becomes the commodity of money. Right? And this is not a medium of communication in exchange anymore, but it's own gain, it's own because it's used generically against all risk. I can de-risk so many universal risks. That's pretty true. It's like a universal solvent of water."
"Speaker 3","00;52;10;25","00;52;34;02","You know, it becomes something that's biologically very dynamic. And so the idea of the medium of exchange is a fascinating one. Here. So I just wanted to run through that a little bit. And then so if you look at it that way, then the meaning. So this is Zimbabwe local community meaning. And then there's the United States local community meaning."
"Speaker 3","00;52;34;13","00;52;53;17","And they're different because the community is what generates the value not the money. This is a piece of paper has exactly the same value as a US dollar, but it's the symbol of a system. And the system as a community and the communities where the value comes from, not from the piece of paper. So that's the intrinsic uncovering."
"Speaker 3","00;52;54;12","00;53;26;20","One of the things that have been person with just to share on this point is so the past people have been doing money and maybe they're not so stupid, maybe they've been doing clubs, maybe this is a money club right? And so one of the challenges is, well, now maybe we need a redistribution idea among the clubs. And I think one of the things that's really appealing about where you're describing things is the intrinsic transparency that comes with the exponential increase in interaction volumes."
"Speaker 3","00;53;27;24","00;53;52;24","So it's impossible to sip press. Transparency among so many interactions is very similar to after 28 financial break where there were calls to get rid of the rating agencies because there was one stop shop for conflicts of interest. You pay them more money, you get a better rating. And they said instead, let's get rid of the rating agencies and let's use the spreads and credit default swap markets because it tells you the same information."
"Speaker 3","00;53;52;24","00;54;10;22","Will the company pay its debts as they become due? That's the rating agency. Tell you and that's the spreads and credit default swap markets tell you. But the difference is in the credit default swap markets, those are set by thousands of interactions, so you can't game them right that the distributed governance looks like. And that's what intrinsically feels like."
"Speaker 3","00;54;10;22","00;54;36;24","You're building that from the bottom up. But not just these are the financial instruments but these are the anything. And so that community as the source of trust and knowledge. And then I call the community trust community information boomerang because then when you want to authenticate or audit, you go back to the community because that's the ultimate source of trust, because that's where it came from in the first place, because it didn't come from the data passing through it."
"Speaker 3","00;54;37;01","00;54;58;03","It came from the fact of the meaning in the community drenching and enriching the information as it goes through. Right. So I really love the way you're telling me. I just want to make a few comments on it. But all that abstraction of money is kind of an interesting thing that you get to the levels of abstraction where abstraction itself becomes a form of violence."
"Speaker 3","00;54;59;07","00;55;19;13","Because it's because it reduces the granularity with which a system sees the individual. And so just last point, Kandinsky of the folks on the phone have heard this already, but Kandinsky made it. The the painter said once that violent societies yield abstract art. And one of the things I always wondered is, is that reversal is abstraction itself, violence."
"Speaker 3","00;55;19;13","00;55;38;02","And to me, it feels they get to a certain scale. It feels like bands try dealing with Varese. And the other day I was so frustrated I was wanted to slam my phone down on the receiver down, but I only had a cell phone. I don't have an old cell phones. I couldn't slam it down with drama anyway."
"Speaker 4","00;55;42;12","00;56;08;12","So these are you raised a whole series of really interesting and important points so first, what is money like? You know, if we're going to if we're going to design new systems, including new economic systems, new financial systems, new monetary systems, what is what is money? What is what is what is what is its function in a club or in a society?"
"Speaker 4","00;56;08;12","00;56;35;08","Right. Well, already in what I call native systems, money is a voting tool. If I have $1,000,000,000, I get to vote for any number of things that I want. I can make I can make whole organizations do fulfill my, you know, desires because I have I have enormous voting power. Now, obviously, that voting power is not democratic, it's not transparent."
"Speaker 4","00;56;35;08","00;57;12;06","It's you know, it's really dysfunctional. The flow of information and the and quite obviously, if we're going to design new systems, which you would want do, it's fine. That money is used as a information tool. But that information tool should be completely transparent, fairly distributed. You know, it should actually function as a way for all of us to share our desires, our fears, our our our you know, our viewpoint it's our, our, our preferences to the community."
"Speaker 4","00;57;12;07","00;57;56;13","You know, it's redesigned money that serves an informational purpose and isn't true and is transparent and is, you know, deeply democratic. And its function, that's a that would be a useful way to communicate, you know, so so that's part of the task is how do we do that? How do we design a system that functions, but how do we turn our economic system that functions that way where money is no longer even viewed as money in the normal way that economics is, as a matter of fact, that economics, the like the economic profession, save for a club is not even resembles economics, because suddenly we're not talking about economics, we're talking about cognition, we're talking"
"Speaker 4","00;57;56;13","00;58;21;28","about a societal cog. This is all about decision making, uncertainty in reference to some fitness, you know, vitality score of like this is cognition. How do we how do we it's no longer economics. Now it's a now it's a new field called cognition that happens to use a voting tool that we might call money. So."
"Speaker 3","00;58;22;16","00;58;23;04","Oh, sorry."
"Speaker 4","00;58;23;24","00;58;48;13","Just a couple of things on that. So, you know, X Club, it redesigned the, say, national currency. You can't redesign the dollar or anything like that. So but it can't create a currency for its own use within its own within its own milieu. That functions exactly the way that I'm describing that that is transparent. That is, you know, does all of the things that we've just been describing."
"Speaker 4","00;58;48;20","00;59;00;03","So I take a shot of that in my design of the lead framework. And if we get to it I'll try to, you know, show you how how can I show you how that works."
"Speaker 3","00;59;00;03","00;59;29;17","Well, and so it's just a quick follow up. That's one of the elements of sovereignty, right? Is the tax and the money issuance, the M1 supply. You can't use a Starbucks card everywhere because that would intrude on the sovereign supply of money on the fiat and so the exertion of authority into every every interaction is has three parties in it because the trading medium is a declaration by the sovereign that they are there to help."
"Speaker 3","00;59;29;17","00;59;39;07","But it's like Von Munchausen by proxy syndrome, right? They keep people weak in their interactions in order for themselves to be strong."
"Speaker 4","00;59;40;23","00;59;41;02","Right."
"Speaker 1","00;59;41;13","00;59;51;17","Very interesting. Just because there's a bunch of questions, the chat and a lot of raised hands. So I want to get to everyone in order. So, Dave, that I'm going to ask a question in the chat and then blue in Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;59;52;13","01;00;34;25","That yeah it's not self evident what the relations of property intellectual property, occupation and competence in the US, there seems to be a an insistence that there that the traditional money relationship structures everything else. Your competence is determined by who write your paycheck, your credibility is determined by that it isn't that way. Every place in Mexico the right to professional association and voluntary association is written into the constitution."
"Speaker 2","01;00;35;03","01;01;20;26","In the Philippines, the government is constitutionally obligated not just to tolerate but to actively promote most professional associations and voluntary associations and reading some of the things and by no means all the things that Robert David Steele says. Denmark apparently is doing a fabulous job of managing the knowledge economy and moving more and more all the time to open source everything except maybe initiation of a government force out and out violence to preserve buildings and children and things like that."
"Speaker 2","01;01;23;09","01;01;38;18","Thanks for the comment. Sure. Yeah. If you looked at it, Steele's proposals for setting up be very much more transparent way of exchanging knowledge and vetting competence."
"Speaker 4","01;01;39;23","01;01;41;06","No, I'm not I'm not familiar."
"Speaker 1","01;01;42;02","01;01;43;05","Let's share."
"Speaker 4","01;01;43;05","01;01;44;15","That. So it sounds interesting."
"Speaker 2","01;01;44;15","01;01;46;00","I'm off. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;01;46;19","01;02;10;09","Cool. And part of this prelude in the research and development phase is certainly to take stock of various proposals that address different aspects related to transparency, accountability, information propagation, value exchange, crypto economics, and FTAs. All these things are going to be woven together in a new tapestry that hopefully is our parachute slash trampoline. So if on."
"Speaker 4","01;02;11;17","01;02;12;03","It."
"Speaker 1","01;02;13;01","01;02;34;12","Yvonne asked a question in the chat, he says, Hello, thanks, John. For the second stream. Sixth stream, it is excellent. My question is, does the club model imply a governance where two or more clubs come into confrontation in their ways of acting so early? Stage Club development or late stage, let's just say two clubs don't just believe different things."
"Speaker 1","01;02;34;12","01;02;38;17","They don't just infer differently, but they act differently. What do we do?"
"Speaker 4","01;02;38;24","01;03;04;24","Sure. OK, so so the in the R&D program, maybe the first task will this to be to work out how cognition, societal cognition, can happen in a club setting, you know, like and then all the different systems that support that. But very quickly, once progress is being made towards that end, the next big question is how do clubs coordinate?"
"Speaker 4","01;03;04;29","01;03;31;29","How do how do they communicate? So just as there would be just as there would be systems and technologies and frameworks that allow individuals in a club to communicate and coordinate together and make decisions together, whether they're economic decisions or whether they're governance decisions or whatever kind of legal decisions, whatever that is, that would be a similar kind of overlay to the to the between clubs setting."
"Speaker 4","01;03;31;29","01;03;59;25","Right. So that those those maybe it would be similar technologies. Maybe they would be adapted a little bit for the club to club interactions. But the same kind of concept holds is that clubs, the community of clubs is a cognitive community is a you know, is a is a is an organism, a cognitive organism. So how does it make decisions and view the world and and act now?"
"Speaker 4","01;03;59;25","01;04;20;22","It might be that let's say that down the road there are hundreds of clubs or thousands of clubs and one clubs says, you know what, we really like the slavery idea. That's going to work really well for us. And, you know, we're going to we're going to go off on this tangent or, you know, some, some say destructive tangent."
"Speaker 4","01;04;22;05","01;04;45;11","Well, you know, I mean, how do you how does a healthy family or a healthy group of friends deal with issues like this? You know, how do how do organisms deal with issues like this? You can put pressure in various ways on an organism that is being antisocial, you know, or individual in your family is a brother that's being at a violent or antisocial."
"Speaker 4","01;04;45;11","01;05;06;06","There's various ways you can try to pressure them maybe to behave more socially, appropriately or something. So so that would be part of the the conceptualizing and the design of these frameworks is how do you deal with it? How do you deal with problems when when some club is not is, you know, misbehaving or some individual in the club is misbehaving?"
"Speaker 4","01;05;06;06","01;05;26;19","There ought to be that ought to be well thought out. So you have a procedure that you follow when things like that happen. Right. But but just off the top of my head, there would be many things you might do. Say say a club was, you know, somehow turned wrong. Oh, like a cancer in this community. Well, you can you can decide not to trade with that."
"Speaker 4","01;05;26;19","01;05;43;15","You can all the other clubs can say, you know what, this is not this is not part of our larger community. This isn't right. This doesn't work, and we're going to exile. You you know, I mean, various things you might do, but all of these have to be given thought of how do you deal with the situations that arise."
"Speaker 4","01;05;43;29","01;06;10;15","And, you know, there could well be reasonable ways that through communication, through, you know, through other means that you could start to harmonize the whole if it's in a state of disharmony. Thanks. I mean, obviously, obviously, the human body does that, right? I mean, the human so there's trillions of cells in the human body and somehow they basically all work together."
"Speaker 4","01;06;10;15","01;06;34;01","And on a rare occasion, some cells decide not to. And we might call that a cancer. So, you know, the cancers can happen. And how do you then, you know, the question becomes, how do you prevent cancer from happening? And obviously, I would say obviously one way is to keep the organism healthy. You know, keep it keep it all healthy."
"Speaker 4","01;06;34;23","01;06;48;03","And and that helps keep communications open. You know, that that helps. And then if a cancer still arises, then, you know, how do you then we have to have a way to deal with that."
"Speaker 1","01;06;49;13","01;06;52;11","Thanks, John. So blue and then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;06;55;14","01;07;21;16","So John, I just want to say thanks. I've really enjoyed all of your streams thus far. And this is like a huge problem that you've attempted to tackle here. And so I don't want to like approach it in a way like it seems like I'm a naysayer or like I'm booing. I just there's some extra components here that I think, you know, maybe you have thought about or have approached it in a very delicate way."
"Speaker 2","01;07;21;16","01;07;46;26","So the concentration of wealth and power or I feel in this country and this is definitely personal opinion or maybe in the world is like stems from some kind of spiritual bankruptcy. Right. And and we've always had authority and like you talked about authority and societal cognition in the last paper. And he talks about, you know, how authority comes from either voluntary deference or coercion."
"Speaker 2","01;07;46;27","01;08;19;25","Right. And previously, from the beginning of written records until now and maybe even so now that voluntary deference and coercion both can come from religion and religious groups. And we've seen the God deem right. And so I know that you've kind of sidestepped and produced a very agnostic platform. And I mean, I know that you also to talk about like the interconnectedness of all things and kind of bringing that forward in an education way and not a religious way."
"Speaker 2","01;08;20;04","01;08;41;16","And I definitely appreciate that. But do you think that there it's possible that we're hard wired? You know, we have this God gene, right? Like that we're hardwired to need something beyond and that that if we have that something beyond maybe the concentration of wealth and power, if we all gave if we all did tithing 10% of all of our salary."
"Speaker 2","01;08;41;23","01;08;55;01","I mean, I think that that would equal out the world just that. Right. So so I mean, is it possible that religion is absent and maybe plays a more central role in society than you've allowed it for here?"
"Speaker 4","01;09;00;19","01;09;36;06","Yeah, I've not talked about religion much at all in any of the papers, nor in the series. So these discussions and I don't I don't really want to I, I think this program can go and continue and move forward and reach its aims. Fine. Without without focusing on the topic of religion. Now, you know, because people, people belong to all kinds of organizations, including religious organizations."
"Speaker 4","01;09;36;06","01;10;10;14","The people get meaning from all kinds of organizations and associations so good, you know, fine. That's fine. The, the, the topic here is how does a community coordinate how does it make decisions? How can we create systems that favor beneficial and healthy cognition? Right. So those two things can exist at the same time. You know, people can belong to religions and, and, and participate in healthier systems at the same time."
"Speaker 4","01;10;12;00","01;10;49;09","As far as meaning goes, you know, people find some people find meaning in religion. But in the I think it's useful for this project to also consider the, the some of the ideas that I had in my first paper world view because those ideas of like how we are all interconnected, how we are like and really in some sense transcendent ideas that that have scientific you know, a rationale behind them."
"Speaker 4","01;10;49;09","01;11;22;27","Right that's useful to consider those points in the worldview paper because that at least in my in my thinking those concern ups are are central to even coming up with the the concept of purpose. So what is the if we're if we're together in a society, what what are we doing? What is our purpose like if we don't have a purpose, why are we even associating with each other, you know, just randomly or like just to take advantage of each other?"
"Speaker 4","01;11;22;27","01;11;49;06","Like, why are we even in a community together, you know, like whether it's a large community or small community. So I'm suggesting in the particular in the first paper that that if we come together with a purpose, you know, and that purpose is to thrive now and in the future, then we can do something about that. We can you know, we can create systems that allow us to fulfill that purpose that are true, that are true to purpose."
"Speaker 4","01;11;49;06","01;12;09;29","The technology, in a sense, that's that functions the way it's supposed to function. And the the concept of purpose comes from this larger world view of what is a human, what is an individual. Well, how are we all related to all of life? You know, that's at least to my mind, that's kind of where where the idea of purpose comes from."
"Speaker 4","01;12;10;06","01;12;41;14","You know, the world we're actually together as a society. We're an organism. An organism is connected to all other organisms and all of life is connected all the way up to the biosphere. And our purpose can include all of that. So you could call that a trance, you know, a transcendent perspective, perhaps, and that might be I'm hoping that might be meaningful to folks who might want to be involved in this kind of project because, you know, if it is there a scientific reasons for all of that?"
"Speaker 4","01;12;41;14","01;13;07;01","You know, there's a rationale for all of that. We can explore all of that scientifically and otherwise. You know, as so so yes, people belong to religions and they can continue to belong to religions. And and and from my perspective, that that you know, those organizations will will continue to exist as long as they're useful. Just like any organization, just like any association."
"Speaker 4","01;13;07;02","01;13;33;02","It should continue to exist as long as it's useful. That can happen in the club setting. You know, some people might be religiously oriented. That's fine. And but that's not really the, you know, the club focus, the R&D project, the design of new systems, the engagement of people in societal cognition framework, that can all happen whether someone is religious or not."
"Speaker 2","01;13;34;10","01;13;35;04","So so just."
"Speaker 4","01;13;35;11","01;13;36;24","To dissect that, I sidestep it well."
"Speaker 2","01;13;36;24","01;14;15;17","Enough. There can I just ask a quick follow up? So so what? So definitely in the societal cognition, I mean, I just think that we have to factor in the role that religion plays in the societal cognition because we give our we do voluntary deference and coercion through religion. And I think that it's something that if people ascribe to a religious practice that we have to allow for that and examine what role that will have on societal cognition at large, like whether they're part of a religious organization or not or whatever."
"Speaker 4","01;14;16;00","01;14;30;06","I'm sure. Sure. Those are fine questions. Does does say, you know, does religion A in some ways impact the capacity of these systems to function in the way we're thinking they could function? That's a fair question. That's a scientific question."
"Speaker 2","01;14;31;20","01;14;37;28","Or perhaps examining the framework through the lens of each religion would be maybe useful."
"Speaker 4","01;14;38;12","01;14;56;04","And that would be useful also how that would be part of the question of like, you know, is there some impact that this that religion is having on the system? And if so, let's talk about what how do how does this group see the world? How does that how does that you know, how to what's our differences of the way we see the world?"
"Speaker 4","01;14;56;04","01;15;01;21","You know, those are all fine questions. And all of those questions can be addressed in a kind of a scientific manner."
"Speaker 1","01;15;03;00","01;15;24;05","When when Scott mentioned that there's the buyer and the seller, but also there's like the umbrella of the trust in the software and in the Fiat. You know, Fiat Lux is how the book begins. In some ways. It's a lot like a marriage partnership where there is a third party and that third party is the context. And various religions have different ways to talk about that third entity."
"Speaker 1","01;15;24;15","01;15;45;07","But it's so interesting how when we're dealing with identity and communication and trust, it is like we need to have a higher level scaffold. Now, can nature provide that? Can so called science today or in the future provide that? That's what we're going to discover and discuss. So Stephen and then Lee and then Dave."
"Speaker 5","01;15;48;04","01;16;21;13","Yeah, I mean, this this idea of the environment and how we connect in, say, a shared epistemic niche a way of understanding. And I've Kristen talked about that in some of his interviews around, you know, even religion can help us have a shared I think is an epistemic framework or an epistemic niche for how we can align. And that then ties into you know, how do we treat hidden states if we're going to have active inference."
"Speaker 5","01;16;21;13","01;16;46;17","So what is cognition dynamical system in the brain and body you know the need and where we are in the nation becomes a big part of that. And of course what we're seeing over the last 200 years is there's more and more states that are being fixed in the environment. The things that we say we know are mechanical objects which will take over and get rid of uncertainty."
"Speaker 5","01;16;47;16","01;17;15;23","The markets will supposedly deal with all of that, all these different, and it leaves less of a role for trying to attune to hidden states beyond. So that that may be one of those question tunes around, you know, money being a classic case of that, you know, how much do we trust in the economy economics and that so you know, just vote for the best economics and it will do with everything."
"Speaker 5","01;17;17;04","01;17;45;28","But where is that is that really the optic cue that fits talks about the answer cuz I choose in the environment like traffic lights that we just build all the traffic lights and then we just work to do what they tell us. But that's where that that violence can come in that I think was also mentioned is because they want to cuz will always win if they're very strong over active influence in a community because active influence in the community needs integration."
"Speaker 5","01;17;45;28","01;18;04;20","It needs time to actually listen to the landscape and if you can have the optic cues that say well just you know that's not needed, you kill a lot of that. So in some ways that might be relevant here is showing the benefit of epistemic issues yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;18;05;02","01;18;29;11","So in some ways these conversations are related to some of the points that Bloom is picking up on. So so you know, if you try to talk a little bit about about this so religion is a part of culture. You know, you can think of that as religious groups, as are different cultural groups, kind of social cultural groups."
"Speaker 4","01;18;29;11","01;18;29;18","Right."
"Speaker 4","01;18;31;22","01;19;00;20","And then, you know, culture is really useful. Cultural norms are really useful or can be useful. They can draw our attention to things in the world that are most important and help us to avoid danger. And, you know, a healthy culture is is a part of cognition. It's a way to offload my cognitive burden onto the, you know, the history of this culture that has learned as it has gone through life what works and what doesn't work."
"Speaker 4","01;19;00;20","01;19;31;20","You know, so so so all you know, it is good that that it say we had a large club with cultural multiple subsets of cultural subsets in it. The the again, the purpose of the club is societal cognition. Right. And we should have ways to measure if that's functional or dysfunctional both in are we achieving equality of high quality of life."
"Speaker 4","01;19;31;20","01;19;55;05","Are we, you know, are we are we is our uncertainty about the future high or low or how are we doing and so so part of that is in engaging with cultural groups of subsets, you know, within a within a club or within a community. Right. The idea of all of this, what, you know, like what is the idea of cognition?"
"Speaker 4","01;19;55;05","01;20;26;28","Well, cognition requires communication. You know, there's no that cells in the brain don't function if there is not communication that's going back and forth. Rich, rich communication, right. So we can beside as a as a as a group, you know, we can we can we can we can study different kind of designs for systems. We can measure their success we can you know, we can we can apply a kind of a scientific method to come up with good ways to ensure that we're we can all thrive."
"Speaker 4","01;20;27;12","01;21;03;08","But part of that is also in allowing for and providing for and facilitating the communication between group associations that are subsets of any club or any society. Right. I mean, the idea has to be communication and in a cooperative sense. Right? Or else there's no cognition to begin with, you know, then you just have rules and it's who get God knows who made those rules in the first place, you know, so we're just all we're doing is just, just let's just look at how cognition works and let's be honest about it."
"Speaker 4","01;21;03;08","01;21;39;03","Let's be transparent about it. Let's, you know, let's just peel back the covers and see how social cognition works and see how cognition works in, in biology and learn what we can learn from it. And let's bring the richness of that out and make it all transparent and fair. So that allows for subgroups to have cultural differences then that's important because cultural, you know, cultural subgroups will have a different perspective on how to do things or what's important to where we should focus our attention."
"Speaker 4","01;21;39;03","01;22;01;09","You know, that's all good, right? As long as as long as it's set up such that we're all able to openly communicate and tell our story and tell our narrative, whether that's as an individual or whether that's as a cultural subgroup. You know, there's a narrative to expressed. There's concerns there's desires, there's needs. You know, again, humans are very complex organisms."
"Speaker 4","01;22;01;09","01;22;30;13","We have very complex needs. And all of those, you know, all the core needs need to be fulfilled. Then we're ever a healthy society. We build, you know, the need for association, the need for love, the need for helping each other. Like we, you know, we want to help each other. We have to address all of that. And it just has to be open and transparent and openly discussed about what we're doing and how this works and how people, you know, how these tools and approaches facilitate cooperation and cognition or hinder it."
"Speaker 4","01;22;30;22","01;22;32;15","You know, that's the experiment."
"Speaker 1","01;22;34;00","01;22;40;08","Thanks, John Lee. And then anyone else with the question yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;22;40;08","01;23;15;14","I think this is a related question. I'm just going to read out just one thing from your paper, actually. So in this paragraph, you you say in a second order approach to actually print and emphasize if a society understands itself as a cognitive organism, if it understands its cognitive processes, reducing uncertainty for the purpose of achieving a sustainably maintaining vitality and understand its social systems of the cognitive architecture, then given those beliefs, what kind of societal systems might it develop and employ?"
"Speaker 2","01;23;16;06","01;23;33;27","And so that got me thinking, is that all those beliefs prerequisite for everybody in the club. Does it need to be that level of shared understanding or can it be just held within a kind of a subsystem? You know, is that something that perhaps the the scientists who are doing the simulation?"
"Speaker 4","01;23;33;27","01;23;58;01","It's actually a good question. Now, I think we should allow that if this R&D program were to go forward, that, you know, it might start small and focused and it might be a focus group involved of those people who are interested in this kind of thing. Right. And if it started to work and, you know, proved to be beneficial to communities, then it might grow and other people would get involved."
"Speaker 4","01;23;58;01","01;24;21;15","And so we can think of this whole thing as progression. I think that's fair. That's the way it would naturally play out. And the you know, if the scientific community is involved in this and if the scientific community is involved in creating and helping to, you know, designing new systems, well, then there's going to certainly be a focus on the scientific viewpoint in order to do that."
"Speaker 4","01;24;22;10","01;24;47;08","Communities obviously would have their input into the R&D program. And, you know, it would be between the two, between the two, it would move forward. But I would guess, though, that early participants and early efforts would be focused, you know, would more or less align with what I have in the worldview paper, or else they why would they be interested in participating in the first place?"
"Speaker 4","01;24;47;08","01;25;09;01","You know, like they would maybe only be interested because they they can see some alignment with the goals of the program and the way the program is oriented and what it's trying to achieve. Right. So quite likely the early participants in this whole thing, whether they're scientists or community members, might be kind of more or less aligned with ideas in the world of your paper."
"Speaker 4","01;25;09;01","01;25;32;20","And and especially the purpose of, you know, the purpose of the club or the purpose of societal cognition. Now, suppose down the road, you know, 20 years from now, I live in Los Angeles, and there, you know, like I don't, I don't care at all about any of that stuff. I just want to live my life and, you know, make sure my I have a roof over my head and stuff."
"Speaker 4","01;25;32;27","01;25;53;23","But this club is up and going and is doing well and they're all there, you know, they're actually doing well. My neighbor is a part of it and his life is improved in some way. So like, I don't really I don't really, you know, like I don't I don't care about any of that purpose stuff too much, but I like what's happening, you know, like they got a nice scene going on there that's beneficial."
"Speaker 4","01;25;54;00","01;26;11;28","So I'm going to join anyway, you know? And so to a degree, the culture of it would change, it would evolve, but hopefully that would be it would start with a certain kind of it would start in a healthy, functional way, you know, aligned with the purpose of the whole project. And then it would evolve the way it evolves."
"Speaker 4","01;26;11;28","01;26;37;14","You know, I would, I would guess that if it's beneficial, those beneficial ideas would continue to be the, you know, at its core somehow but how would exactly it evolves, you know, as as decades goes on and is, you know, 100 years from now, it's maybe, maybe, you know, if this exists 100 years from now and if it's spread widely, maybe we're using very different language to talk about it."
"Speaker 4","01;26;37;14","01;26;38;26","And we see it differently."
"Speaker 1","01;26;38;26","01;26;49;00","Perhaps Thanks, John. Now, as the author, it is up to you. Would you like to shift the second slide for today?"
"Speaker 4","01;26;49;24","01;26;51;29","Oh, these are awesome. OK."
"Speaker 1","01;26;53;05","01;27;12;03","Thanks to everyone in the chat and for participating because it's a conversation and John's initial inroads are tripartite and very provocative and we're seeing that play out. And so it's a great beginning to a discussion, even though it's our dot two video so job, where would you like to take it for the last session?"
"Speaker 4","01;27;13;20","01;27;36;16","Yeah, obviously there's a lot of ideas in this whole series. There's just a ton of ideas, both both superficial and deep. And if this goes forward, it's going to take a lot of discussion and it's going to take a lot of people involved to bring different perspectives to kind of bring this whole concept to fruition. Right? So we're just scratching the surface."
"Speaker 4","01;27;36;16","01;27;58;00","That's all we're doing and we're just putting out some of the big ideas. And then, you know, there's a ton of work that has to happen to make this real. So can you go to space for number four, four of some of the slides maybe and maybe slide 76."
"Speaker 1","01;27;58;26","01;28;01;18","View seven integrated components on slide six."
"Speaker 4","01;28;02;18","01;28;04;23","Six. Yep, yep. Seven Unbreakable."
"Speaker 1","01;28;05;03","01;28;05;16","Awesome."
"Speaker 4","01;28;05;18","01;28;32;17","OK, so maybe in the last little remaining time we'll just touch on this little framework of the simulation model that I put out. It's really the the idea of the leader is more than just an economic system. It is actually the idea of it is put out in the Bay. And in my book Economic Direct Democracy talks about the whole picture, the larger picture."
"Speaker 4","01;28;32;18","01;28;58;05","But there is as you can see from the slide, there's seven components to that. And and they really touch on all six overarching systems that I talk about in the series. So economic governance, legal and political education and health, it's all in there somewhere. So the idea of the leader that's local economic, direct democracy association the idea of the leader leader is an integrated framework of cognitive systems."
"Speaker 4","01;28;59;23","01;29;37;28","The simulation really focuses more just on the economic aspect because that was the it really was just the easiest piece to pick up. First and that the value in particular focuses on what I call the token exchange system, which is the first three in the list. So there's a talk token is a is a local digital currency so that the community creates and uses there's the token monetary system, there's what I call the crowd based financial system, and there's market system, local markets, people sell, you know, traded goods and sell them in local markets."
"Speaker 4","01;29;37;28","01;29;59;29","They also obviously sell distantly to people who are either in the local area, but not a part of the club, but also far distant that are not a part of the club. So those first three things constitute the token exchange system. And we'll just maybe talk a little bit about the same relation and some of the results and how that works."
"Speaker 4","01;30;04;00","01;30;37;11","Maybe Slide eight. Yeah. Yep. So in the simulation, there's five aggregate agents. There is organizations, persons, crowd based financial system, local government, and then the rest of the world, which I call rest of counties, that the data for the simulation, the initial data was from the US Census for Eugene, Oregon, relatively small community, small county, population, 100,000 or something like that."
"Speaker 4","01;30;38;04","01;31;09;12","And and I used starting income values from the census data for Eugene County and from 2014 or something like that. This paper was published I believe in 2014. So I probably used a little earlier data to get things rolling OK, so the, the simulation just really illustrate it. It doesn't, it doesn't predict how this system would work. It just illustrates my thinking about how a system could work."
"Speaker 4","01;31;10;01","01;31;39;18","And in particular, I wanted to, I wanted to design a system that would, that could bootstrap itself up without a large influx of cash or other things from outside. So that was part of the idea of how can a system bootstrap itself up, start with very little and grow from there. And the second was I wanted to create an economic system for the for the club model where over time incomes became equal, income, income and wealth equalized."
"Speaker 4","01;31;40;05","01;32;22;27","And the the thinking there is that money and in the and, you know, the whole economic and financial aspects of that really is part of the cognitive community's cognitive system. So we're using money as a very transparent voting tool. It's like votes in for patients carrying information about people's desires and fears and everything and uh, yeah, so that's, that's I wanted to show that using a stock flow consistent model agent based or stock flow consistent model, I just wanted to show that the numbers add up correctly, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;32;23;10","01;32;44;09","Like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not creating dollars out of nowhere. There's like there's a logical way this plays out and all the numbers add up there. If there's a flow from one agent, one of these major agents, there's a, you know, there's any flow from one agent, go somewhere just doesn't disappear."
"Speaker 4","01;32;46;15","01;33;11;10","So very briefly, the the lines in blue are the flow of tokens and dollars so a community is creating tokens as it grows. As it grows, it creates more tokens. The concept is that the value of a token would be sort of it's sort of equivalent to the value of a dollar and it's made to be done inflation inflationary."
"Speaker 4","01;33;11;10","01;33;35;11","So let's just just say for 2014 it was the value of a token is the value of a dollar purchasing power of a token is that of a dollar in 2014 and the community would create tokens a little bit the first year or little bit more of the second year. More people get engaged as more use for tokens as is more ways to use them in in the local markets."
"Speaker 4","01;33;35;11","01;34;04;03","Then there would be more tickets tokens created and and the and the and the volume of tokens in the local community would grow and salary for those who are members of the club salaries would be paid both in tokens and dollars. So maybe in the first year you would just get a few top tenants and then over time your share of tokens in your wages would go up and the same would be true."
"Speaker 4","01;34;04;03","01;34;25;18","Even if you're just say you yourself on the business, you know, people you would sell your if you're a member of the community would sell things to other members of the community and they would pay you in both dollars and tokens. I'm using dollar as the national currency. So organizations just to look at the blue lines again, organizations pay wages to persons."
"Speaker 4","01;34;25;18","01;34;52;27","The persons might be employed or unemployed. I also call the unemployed not that there's some people who are unemployed or not in the workforce. That's what the work stands for. And people who are members who receive dollars and tokens as part of their wages and part of their income would naturally they would have to contribute a certain fraction to the crowd based financial system."
"Speaker 4","01;34;53;27","01;35;16;01","And that's the blue line for contributions to the CBC and the scene from the CBC. If I'm an organization or I'm an individual and I have some idea to start a business, or I need I need loans for my business or I'm a nonprofit and I want grants, I can go to the CBS and apply for a grant or or a subsidy or donation."
"Speaker 4","01;35;16;24","01;35;42;05","And once as a person, once my once some of my currency is in the DFS, I more or less get to decide how that money is used. Like I want to support schools or I like this idea of a new light bulb. I like that. I like that this business idea that this person came up with, I'd like to give them a subsidy or I'd like to give them a loan or a donation or something like that."
"Speaker 4","01;35;43;04","01;36;13;24","Again, this is all very transparent. And again, as time goes on, incomes become more equal so that when because incomes become more equal, everyone has equal amount of power. And the CDF asked to direct how the community spends its money the green line ends in this figure. Our dollars and obviously you have to pay taxes in dollars. The government's not going to accept tokens."
"Speaker 4","01;36;13;24","01;36;43;05","So you pay taxes in dollars. The government also provides some income support for people who are unemployed. That's natural normal. The government also provides some grants and contracts and subsidy is to organizations. That's quite normal. And organic organizations that are members also have to deal with the outside world. They have to sell their goods and exchange goods and services using dollars."
"Speaker 4","01;36;43;06","01;37;08;23","So there's the green lines so that's how the basic system works. And then I and then as this, this the system evolves over a period of 28 years in the simulation and I'll show you what the results are as this everything goes round and round. We're not going to have, we only have a few minutes left. So I'm going to kind of have to just get to the point here there's some options on the next slide, which I can ask."
"Speaker 1","01;37;09;23","01;37;17;06","Which of these agents are active inference agents or where does active inference come into play? Or could come into play with later versions of this simulation?"
"Speaker 4","01;37;19;24","01;37;56;09","OK, so again, the the the leader framework is an integrated system that has a governance component. The governance component has a legislative component, and all the major six overarching systems are addressed in some way. I'm only simulating the economic part right. So so if you were in a real club and a real club looked anything like the leader, there would be a governance system that you would be participating in some kind of collaborative governance system to help decide what should happen in the community, the building legislative system and legal system and so on."
"Speaker 4","01;37;57;04","01;38;28;14","Education system and everything so that's one way that active inference would be involved just in the process of decision making under uncertainty and in the in this particular simulation, you know, obviously businesses are having to make decisions and choose choose what they do with their resources. So that's another way that cognition is happening. And then the maybe the main in this economic picture, maybe the main agent is the CVS."
"Speaker 4","01;38;28;26","01;38;53;17","That's a that's a financial system where everyone is able to participate in a transparent and democratic way to fund those things that they think are useful to their community that create the kind of jobs that they want to create, you know, do as a community. Do we want lots of nonprofit jobs? Do we want for profit jobs? Do we want jobs in the manufacturing center?"
"Speaker 4","01;38;53;17","01;39;20;09","Do we create manufacturing sector do we want like do we want to support this kind of business? Do we want to support that kind of business? These are all decisions that the community makes through the CVS. And then you know, if if the community decides like, yeah, we want this bakery, this would be great, or this bookstore or this soup farm or whatever it is, then the community can, you know, associate within the CBN first and say, OK, here's a thousand of us."
"Speaker 4","01;39;20;09","01;39;29;17","We like this idea for this farm. Here's funding for it. So, you know, go for it. So active inference particularly would be happen in the CVS."
"Speaker 1","01;39;31;04","01;39;33;17","Yes, even a question. And then anyone else with a question."
"Speaker 5","01;39;35;29","01;40;04;15","I suppose in a way you've seen a mix here between like in the in the red boxes, you can have active inference that dynamic or non-linear systems of inference. And then you've got this message passing, which to some extent is that in the aggregated system, the sort of steady equilibrium system, ie the pile of money or the spreadsheet and a message passing where data goes from one to another."
"Speaker 5","01;40;04;15","01;40;27;06","But then within that, there may have to be another process of inference that happens assuming people have any agency and it's not just all automated. So it's like to me, that's probably where you've got system dynamics in that diagram. And then you've got these inside that nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e. the inference processes embedded in inside. Yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;40;27;23","01;40;45;08","There obviously is a lot going on there that we're not going to have time to talk about because we have like 5 minutes left or 10 minutes left. But but just to give you one example of that, suppose that a group in the community wants to create some kind of business and they want to produce some kind of product, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;40;45;29","01;41;05;15","So they come to the city and say, Hey, we want to make this new thing. Well, a lot of information has to go back and forth right this is an information rich system. So so I want to if I'm going to, if I'm going to support this with my resources in the city events, I want to know where you get what you know, where are you getting the raw materials?"
"Speaker 4","01;41;05;22","01;41;27;08","How is that impacting the environment and how is your product going to improve or harm? My sense of community or any one of the metrics that we're measuring, how is that going to is there any pollution? How are you going to deal with your ways? How much energy do you need? Do we have that level of energy like electricity or whatever as a community?"
"Speaker 4","01;41;27;08","01;41;47;18","Do we have that resource? I mean, there is an enormous amount of discussion and information has to flow between these different parties in order to make the kind of decisions that, you know, intelligent decisions that you would want to make in the CBN. That's OK. So in the few minutes time we have remaining, we could turn to slide 15, please."
"Speaker 1","01;41;48;12","01;41;49;05","All right. Go for it."
"Speaker 4","01;41;50;02","01;42;22;19","So these are some of the results that I should say that some of the right at the get go as a community is forming, as a club is forming, you know, they would be choosing their trajectory. They would be and in this upper left hand corner, as an example of that, they would be choosing that they want income to rise to a certain level over time, that they want participation to happen in this club at a certain rate over time."
"Speaker 4","01;42;23;09","01;42;45;06","They want to they want in particularly the lower lower left there, they want the income target to rise at a certain rate over time. And obviously, you can't you know, like you can't just flood a community with money on day one and expect that to work because there's no the same whatsoever to say with digital currency because there's not a place to spend it."
"Speaker 4","01;42;45;10","01;43;09;24","Like there's, you know, it's a tool for voting. And if there's no place to vote, the tool is useless, right? So that's partly why things grow slowly over time so that there becomes outlets for using the currency. You know, to create the kind of economy and economic system that the community wants. So some of these things would be decided ahead of time."
"Speaker 4","01;43;09;24","01;43;29;17","But here's what we want is a trajectory. Here's what we're here's what we're doing as a community using the system. This is where we're going. This is what we're going to do. This is how it works. And if we all cooperate in this way, that's exactly how it's going to happen. You know, that's that's the concept is so it's not just here's a system use it however you want."
"Speaker 4","01;43;29;17","01;43;50;15","Let's see how it goes. It's really more you know, we we're a community that we have a goal and here is how we intend to reach our goal. We want, say, for example, we want incomes to rise to a certain level over time. And this is, you know, can this system do that? And if the answer is yes, well, then here's how we're going to do it."
"Speaker 4","01;43;50;15","01;44;06;21","We're going to increase it a certain amount every year and it's all going to work out. And so in that sense, some of this should be no there should be no surprises for the community as they do a field trial. It should be working exactly the way they intended it to work, bringing them where they want to go."
"Speaker 4","01;44;07;02","01;44;28;07","For example, when you drive a car on a trip, you know where you want to go. If you're halfway there, if it's a two day trip and on day one, you're halfway there, then you know your moving in the right direction. It's all going just where you intended to go. OK, so on this slide, I may be on the lower right hand corner."
"Speaker 4","01;44;29;13","01;45;12;22","This is what happens over 30 years as this simulation moves forward. The this is showing the average family income in the membership. It starts at a fairly low level. This is from the census data. This is where they start when you're 00 and every year the average family income increase is essentially the leader is paying people to join either because the because the income target is rising and my income is go up my wages are going up as the income target goes up or I actually have make a lot of money but I'm joining anyway just to get that bonus, you know whatever it is $1,000 a year and tokens or whatever that bonuses."
"Speaker 4","01;45;13;22","01;45;42;20","So people are joining because it is it is in their economic best interest to join. And as that goes on the income target rises and then family income you can see the blue line their family income average family income more than doubles over the 30 year period. So the average family is between tokens and dollars. The average family income is over it's around 110,000 annually as as time goes on."
"Speaker 4","01;45;43;04","01;46;11;24","Now I might note that the dollar aspect obviously the community needs to bring in dollars in order for this to happen because some of the income is paid in some of the wages are paying dollars and some are paid in tokens. So part of what this community is doing is they're adjusting their outflows, they're adjusting their transactions with the rest of the world such that they're keeping dollars in circulation longer than would otherwise otherwise be natural."
"Speaker 4","01;46;12;09","01;46;47;26","So for example, there's like a buy local program and there's ways to support local local businesses and keep money, keep dollars circulating in their local economy longer. And in the end, what happens is at this high income level, what actually happens is the community is is is increasing the the number of dollars in circulation locally up to the point where their average dollar income is the national dollar, an average national dollar income."
"Speaker 4","01;46;48;07","01;47;16;22","So, you know, like today in today's world, the incomes are very, very unequal. There's a few extremely wealthy people and most everyone else is not making very much. But there is an average dollar, you know, average dollar income over the country. And what the leader is doing over time is is kind of pulling in dollars into their local system such that they're just reaching the average over time."
"Speaker 4","01;47;17;09","01;47;50;28","And then so they're reaching the average an average dollar income, which is about 70,000 or so dollars. And then they're also have on top of that income in tokens which the community is creating. So between the tokens and dollars eventually they get to the point where where they're having about a family of about a hundred thousand so somebody had said earlier that, you know, maybe it was you, Danielle, that I'm both I'm both saying that money is a different animal in this system and motivations are different."
"Speaker 4","01;47;51;06","01;48;11;04","And in the next breath I'm saying, oh, this is a motivation. You can, you can make more money. So both of those things are true. At the same time. And and there's a transition period where we go from here to there, right? I mean, this whole thing just doesn't happen overnight. If we want to transform society, it takes time."
"Speaker 4","01;48;12;11","01;48;33;08","And so in this transition period, we might be well, you might be thinking of money and income in both ways, like in the more traditional sense of I need money to pay my rent and then in the new sense of money as the voting tool. And we all need to have a more or less equal income so that we have more or less equal voting power in this community."
"Speaker 4","01;48;33;28","01;48;59;22","Now, what happens after 30 years or 50 years? And maybe our understanding of all of this deepens and widens and, you know, maybe the, the current concepts of money and economy fall away or more time in exchange for this new, new focus on cognition and well-being and value of community, depending on how well it's thriving isn't it?"
"Speaker 1","01;48;59;23","01;49;15;16","So is the code, is the code or the formalism available because people might tweak a parameter and get a totally different response. They might include another variable or another function, get a totally different outcome. So how can we do a short version of this in the source way so that we can be working together on something that's transparent?"
"Speaker 4","01;49;16;11","01;49;39;27","Yeah. Yeah. The code was made of open source to be made available publicly back in 2014. And also there's a interactive simulation on the website. It needs a little work but it functions so you can go to the website principal society's project dot org and you can to some degree you can type in some different numbers and see how that all works out."
"Speaker 4","01;49;40;15","01;50;02;14","So you can play with that a little bit on the website. But beyond that, this simulation is really quite simple and if I were to record it, I might record it in a different way today than I did back in 24 or ten. But this simulation is really quite simple. It needs this is just a first glance of a conceptual glance of how this could work and it needs all kinds of work."
"Speaker 4","01;50;02;14","01;50;35;19","There's all kinds of ways that we could expand this that, you know, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered and we could expand the simulation to answer questions better or address more questions. So, so you know, you can download the code that I put up in 2014, but ideally I think we would move forward and develop a, you know, kind of a more functional framework for this that we could try out different approaches and in different ways to make one maybe on this slide 16 in these last few minutes."
"Speaker 4","01;50;36;10","01;51;04;10","This is maybe one of the quicker slides you can see on the right the histogram of this is the starting distribution of income in the county. And then below is the income distribution at the end of the 30 year period. And you can see practically everybody is making this 110,000 currency per year on the left you can see how the unemployment rate changes."
"Speaker 4","01;51;04;10","01;51;48;07","It starts at about 7% or so in the county and drops down to essentially full employment On the next slide slide 17 and on the top left is the curve of how much money is in circulation in the best over time. And you can see that there are about 6 billion in currency circulates annually at the end of 30 years and the CBO has so again this is a highly transparent, deeply democratic and collaborative way to decide how money should be spent in the community and so imagine this is a very small community of like a hundred thousand people or something like that."
"Speaker 4","01;51;48;07","01;52;31;08","So this is $6 billion for a hundred thousand people to decide how they want to, you know, what they want for their community, what kind of jobs they want, what kind of what kind of you know, how many nonprofits they want versus for profits, how what they want. Like, you know, that's a lot of money. And with that much money, the community would have enormous flexibility and capacity to make the kinds of decisions that it would want to make about how how it lends its life maybe that's the that's the, you know, that's maybe the main slides, the main results, essentially income more than doubles, enormous amount of money circulates annually in the CPUs."
"Speaker 4","01;52;31;15","01;52;46;09","And the community gets decide gets to decide in a very transparent and deeply democratic way how that money is spent. So maybe we'll end there since we're out of time. But there's obviously a lot more details and simulation paper and they can read that, too, to pick up more."
"Speaker 1","01;52;47;02","01;53;11;02","Thanks so much, John. So we'll chill for a few more minutes. People can drop off whenever they want to, but maybe if anyone who wants to raise their hand and give a final thought. But it's awesome that the code is posted maybe you can add that in a YouTube comment because it'd be awesome to see maybe where this even plays nicely with the active inference models that we've been exploring in these recent discussions."
"Speaker 1","01;53;11;24","01;53;54;09","So any one wants to raise your hand, give a few more seconds for that. Also, one note about communication, and Stephen was talking about like the agent's activity for its agents and message passing between agents. Also, we know that message passing is a mechanism by which active inference can be computed within an agent. There's a lot of cool papers on that, and it reminded me of some work that I had done in the US, social insects in the ants which investigated how physiological mechanisms that were inside of a solitary insect body like related to the regulation of foraging over evolutionary time in the colony context, become rewired to be playing out across multiple bodies."
"Speaker 1","01;53;54;17","01;54;13;25","So the regulation of foraging for a solitary insect is all on board the fly, but the regulation of foraging for the ant colony is something that's distributed and it got there at the revolution and hundreds of millions of years of it working. So yes, there are failures. Just because one is seeking a goal doesn't mean that they reach the goal most."
"Speaker 1","01;54;13;25","01;54;41;15","And species of course are extinct. But it does point to this way where the kinds of connections that are inside of an agents can be of one kind, and then the communications between agents can be different. We see that with neurons, with ants, with societies, and by having a scale free framework like active inference, we could rethink how communication happens inside and outside so that we can take some agency ourselves in designing our niche in our evolutionary transitions upcoming."
"Speaker 1","01;54;42;00","01;54;43;18","So Dave and then Lee."
"Speaker 2","01;54;46;24","01;55;16;07","I see some data from the actual physical economy in Eugene. Is there any interest in setting up the R.a.f matrices and running an actual physical simulation of the economy? You don't just slop everything into into money, but actually use physical activity and see whether you're exceeding break even over a period of decades."
"Speaker 4","01;55;16;25","01;55;45;17","I mean, I'm not sure if you mean by physical, you mean like an actual claw. Oh, yes. That's where this is going. You know, like in whatever would take six years, ten years, whenever this is ready. Yes. Let's do a real let's do a field trial in a real club and see how this works. But if you're talking about more like in silicone, I'm sure I'm looking at here is just some simple metrics about about real change exchange of currency."
"Speaker 4","01;55;45;26","01;56;14;10","But there's all kinds of things that have to be exchanged and considered. There's energy, there's waste, there's, you know, pollutants. There's a there's raw materials, there's human resources. There's like all of these things. All of the components could become part of a simulation model and should become part of some models over time. So again, this is a very, very simple simulation, and there's tremendous opportunities to expand it and make it more meaningful."
"Speaker 1","01;56;15;18","01;56;16;15","Thanks, Lee."
"Speaker 2","01;56;20;15","01;56;39;13","I am sorry, and I'm going to try back to question to the price of one. So so my first question is, given that there's you know, you see this kind of prelude phase. What what would you see as priorities, initial priorities for for research then to get this really moving? Yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;56;39;13","01;56;57;15","Yeah. I mean, good question. And I wish I had a, you know, a clear path to let's do A, B, C, and D and then it's all going to work out. But I don't. So we have to decide that together, really. I mean, I could I could come up with a list of ideas that we could all discuss together."
"Speaker 4","01;56;57;25","01;57;30;28","You know, for just one is this these kinds of simulation models could be expanded. But there's other things, too. For example, it would be really interesting to just do a survey either of the general population in, you know, in one country or maybe multiple countries, or do a simulation of the global in the global science community and just say to scientists, you know, if this kind of R&D program were were available or were, you know, was activated and there was funding available, would you be interested in participating in this?"
"Speaker 4","01;57;30;28","01;58;01;02","You know, like it would be really interesting to know, is there support for this in the scientific community and in the public does the public is the public interested in fundamentally new systems? You know, those would be interesting questions. There could be media. So you know, somebody should make a documentary about the concept of society as a cognitive organism, what we could become or, you know, we could be art projects that could be media projects, that could be literature projects, that could be civil relations, that could be surveys."
"Speaker 4","01;58;01;02","01;58;26;15","There could be assessments of, say, you know, to some community, some maybe a smallish community and assess what is there, how do we apply metrics to their current fitness, what kind of metrics there could be work on metrics. There could be work on applying metrics to it to an existing community, just as a just to get a background of like where are we now and how would we collect this information that could be there."
"Speaker 4","01;58;26;15","01;58;56;08","Would you know, there could be work on computer models to be like, you know, if we had 50 metrics, how do we combine them into something meaningful for you? Know, for making decisions? You know, there are or on the topic of tools, how what kind of tool would allow 10,000 people to richly communicate and make decisions together? And how can I how can I tell my story to a thousand people or 10,000 people."
"Speaker 4","01;58;56;15","01;59;10;05","How can I can, how can I tell my story, my narrative, my understanding of things in some rich way such that it is computed and used by the whole in a, in a meaningful way. There's also, you know, a few ideas."
"Speaker 1","01;59;10;17","01;59;30;16","You know, and the way that yeah. Thanks for the answer. And Livestream is a new affordance it allows those to speak, but with 100,000 people there isn't enough hours in the life to linearly hear from everyone. And so when we want to speak and we want to hear and listen, active listening, passive speaking, all these things, how are we going to make that happen at scale."
"Speaker 1","01;59;30;16","01;59;38;08","So awesome question that you're raising Stephen and anyone else and then we'll close out yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;59;38;08","02;00;20;22","I think the scale question keeps coming up, right? That's the start to realize that that's everywhere. But often this is not talked about one thing and just sort of to finish off was this the inference is up about how to act in the world, which but there's also the ways to get an insight into the inferences that we're making so in some ways I always think this is even a way to look more deeply and go beyond you know, system dynamics, which is used quite a lot in population work."
"Speaker 5","02;00;21;03","02;00;42;28","But to go into this kind of way to sort of say OK, we're not necessarily creating these clubs to tell you what to do and to replace other governance structures, but to give other ways to get insights into what is going on in the inference process here."
"Speaker 4","02;00;43;10","02;01;07;14","Yeah, excellent. Excellent. So this is, you know, potentially this whole concept is potentially useful for making actually making decisions, decisions for the future as a group but also for individuals and a group to understand how are we how do we cognitive, how are we combating how, what, how can we do that? How could we coordinate better or how do we coordinate?"
"Speaker 4","02;01;07;20","02;01;28;28","How does how do we actually function? You know, like all of these are questions and all of these are open to assessment and so like I could imagine thousands if this went forward, there could be thousands of papers on all kinds of topics. Not just about cognition, but, you know, that would include cognition. But how does it actually work?"
"Speaker 4","02;01;28;28","02;01;32;24","How do you how do humans, how do humans associate and cognitive fit together?"
"Speaker 1","02;01;34;21","02;01;57;29","What a time it will be. So thank you, John. It was great to have you on. And the six appearances were just the tip of the iceberg. So we look forward to continuing the discussion with you, with seeing you in our Tools organizational unit, where we're really inspired to be working towards developing some of those things that you're suggesting that there's a need for."
"Speaker 1","02;01;58;10","02;02;09;25","So thanks, everyone, for joining live and for watching and for the awesome questions. Yvonne Nataliya, et cetera. So we'll see you in the coming weeks with future papers and future discussion. So see you later."
"Speaker 4","02;02;11;17","02;02;12;04","Thanks so much."
"Speaker 1","02;02;12;29","02;02;13;07","Bye."
