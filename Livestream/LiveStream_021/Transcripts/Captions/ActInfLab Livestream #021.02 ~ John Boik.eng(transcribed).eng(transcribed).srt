1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,759
okay hello

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,160
everyone welcome to the active inference

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,880
lab

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,199
to an active inference live stream with

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,000
john boyk

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
this is going to be great it's our

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,279
second

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
of these interactive discussions on the

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,560
sequence of papers

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
that john has written and today

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
we're gonna be hearing about motivation

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
and strategy as well as active inference

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,040
of course

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,920
a lot so i'm daniel friedman i'm a

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
postdoc in california

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
and i'm gonna pass it to john to

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,559
introduce myself

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
lead us into this second discussion

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,559
while i share the jamboard link with our

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,600
live participants

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
so john thanks again for coming on and

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
please take it away

um all right so my name is john boyk uh

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,719
i'm a

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
courtesy faculty at oregon state

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
university environmental sciences

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,479
graduate program

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
and uh we're here in this series of

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
talks this is the second in the series

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,680
to

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
talk about the the um series of three

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
papers that i recently published

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
in the journal sustainability the topic

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
is societal transformation

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,720
in particular the de novo development of

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
new societal systems new economic

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
systems new governance systems legal

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
systems educational systems and so on

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
and last week as maybe you can see on

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,079
the jamboard now

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
last week we started with the first part

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
which was on world worldview the topic

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
the title is science-driven

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
societal transformation part one

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
worldview and

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
uh we didn't actually get through that

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,759
so we're going to pick up a few

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,079
tail end ideas there and then hopefully

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,159
start on the second paper part two

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
which is uh subtitled motivation and

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
strategy

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
and the links for the three papers are

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
there and i of course

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
encourage people to download the papers

57
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,200
they're

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,080
they're open access so everyone can get

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,720
them for

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
free um page two

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,160
perhaps yep

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
okay uh so uh just for more information

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
about the the project about the for the

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
links for the papers for other links

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
there's a

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
bunch of uh little articles that you

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
could look at if you're interested

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,519
there's also an interactive model

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
you could go to the principled societies

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,959
project

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
website and the address is given there

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,400
so

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
further information if you need it you

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,959
can find it there

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
cool three all right three

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
okay all right so we uh we

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
didn't get through the first uh through

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
the paper all the way in the

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
in the first our first talk so there's a

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
few things that i'd like to catch up on

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
uh before we move on to

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
paper part two um we we touched on

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,280
active inference

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
uh in the in the lat in our last talk

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
but we didn't really get around to

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
discussing it so i want to say a few

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
words about active inference itself

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,760
a little bit of a description about it

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
for those who are not familiar

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
um and then we have the topics of

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
cooperation and communication

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
and uh the the concept that complex

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
organisms have complex needs

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
and then on to some practical

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
implications and this is

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
really the main thing i wanted to finish

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
up with is that

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
in in part one i i provide some kind of

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,630
high level sort of

100
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,840
[Music]

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
abstract concepts and i would imagine

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
that the reader in certain places might

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,159
be wondering

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
why are we discussing this what does

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
this have to do with

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
actually building new societal systems

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
so i want to talk about

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
a little bit of the practical

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
implications of all of this

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
kind of abstract all these abstract

111
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,798
notions that we've been working with

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
so i would like to just

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
recall just a few ideas from our last

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,680
talk uh and one is the and that

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
i i claim at least that is society has

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
an intrinsic purpose

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
and uh that and and by intrinsic purpose

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
i really mean

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
a biological purpose that we have gained

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,800
through

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
eons of evolution and that intrinsic

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,160
purpose

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
is the same purpose that every living

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
organism has

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,759
so every living organism has this

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,199
purpose whether that's a

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,720
bacteria or a human and then i also

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
claim that society is an organism

129
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
that can be seen as an organism can be

130
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
viewed as an organism

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,639
and a society has the same intrinsic

132
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
purpose so

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
if we're if our task is to develop new

134
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
societal systems it really

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
helps to have some ideas of well who are

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
we and who are we building this for

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
and what is the purpose of uh if we were

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,639
to build a new

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,800
societal system new economic system for

140
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,919
example

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
what what would be the purpose and

142
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,440
if we know the purpose then we can take

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,639
the remaining

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,039
the next step and say okay we know what

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,720
an economic system is supposed to do we

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
know what a government system is

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,039
supposed to do

148
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,000
so is this new design design a design

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,400
bead

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
is it fit for purpose that's where

151
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
that's the

152
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
concept is that if we're going to

153
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,759
design new societal systems de novo from

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,400
scratch

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
then we ought to have an idea of what

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
they are supposed to do

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,520
and then how we might measure their

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
fitness so that we can determine

159
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
did we did we create something that is

160
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
fit for purpose and which one of these

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
options which one of these designs might

162
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
be more fit for purpose

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,479
than others all right so that's that's

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
kind of where we're going here

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,840
and uh so the the i claim that the

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
intrinsic purpose of a society and

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
organism any organism or any organism

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
is to achieve and maintain vitality

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
which is accomplished through

170
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
largely through cognition and

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,199
cooperation

172
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
and so to maintain and achieve vitality

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,319
for who and that who i claim is the

174
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,360
extended self

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
so the extent this all of us

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,680
are are enmeshed

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,160
in our world enmeshed in our environment

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
enmeshed in

179
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
in a society with each other and

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
if we're speaking of a body then the

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,039
extended self

182
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,080
is those interactions

183
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
with those necessary and vital

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
interactions with

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
the rest of the world so the extended

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
self then is the self

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,000
that extends to other people to to

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
societies to other societies to the

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
environment the local environment the

190
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
global environment the biosphere

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
so then in that sense then if our

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,759
purpose is to

193
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
achieve and maintain fit vitality our

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
purpose is to

195
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
achieve achieve and maintain vitality

196
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,039
for that

197
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
larger extended self that really

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
goes all the way to the biosphere where

199
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
all of life

200
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
is in this together all of life is

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
connected in one

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
and uh and all of life is doing this

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
thing

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
doing this thing of acting to achieve

205
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
and maintain vitality

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
and over eons of evolution we get this

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
amazing

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,440
world of life and whales and sequoia

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,479
trees and

210
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,599
ecosystems and all these tea trees

211
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
talking to a fungi in the ground

212
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
and plants talking to each other and

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
beads doing their thing with

214
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
flowers and each other and i mean it's

215
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,039
just like

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,639
amazing coordination

217
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
and communication and cooperation

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
happening between species and within a

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
species and within a

220
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,199
human body like all of our cells

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,479
so we just if i would say that if we're

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
going to

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
create a better society or create new

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,440
systems that lead to a better society

225
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
then the task will be to to fulfill our

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,039
intrinsic purpose

227
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
which in in a way means to simply get

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,199
with the program

229
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,120
that is get with the program of what all

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,479
of life is doing

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,839
around us right just align with

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
what life is doing and uh then we will

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
you know we'd be off to a good start if

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,039
we can do that

235
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,719
all right so that's uh that's the

236
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,240
purpose and then i

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
at the bottom of that slide i just i

238
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
highlight the word wisdom because

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
it is reasonable you know we we think of

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
a wise action is something that is

241
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
benefit you know widely beneficial

242
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
and action that is

243
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
aware of the needs of others and is

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,640
as useful action but that is what we're

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
talking about we're talking about

246
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
uh of of taking actions that help to

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
fulfill our intrinsic purpose and really

248
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,200
by definition i would say

249
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
that would be wise actions so in that

250
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,640
sense

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
we're aiming at a wisdom society

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
a society where wisdom is valued

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,480
and discussed and sought after

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
and you know and and hopefully one in

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
which

256
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
uh individuals and groups and

257
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
others institutions that act

258
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
with wisdom will be recognized you know

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
as such

260
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
okay so i do ask the question there at

261
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
the bottom can wisdom be reversely

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,839
defined now

263
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,320
often it's you know it's it's a term

264
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
that is just

265
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
generically applied to like to uh

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
to uh you know actions that are that are

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
some people feel are useful or

268
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
appear to be useful but but if we're

269
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
going to build

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
new societal systems and we're going to

271
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
have some sense of

272
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
fitness for these systems and the

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,120
systems are in some

274
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
way supposed to help us to act with

275
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,120
wisdom

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
and to facilitate action with wisdom

277
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
then perhaps there is some way actually

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
to

279
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
rigorously define wisdom or to know when

280
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
when actions are wise and i would say

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
then that leads us right into the

282
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
concept of active inference

283
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
because because uh through active

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
inference we what we might say that

285
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,839
actions that reduce uncertainty and

286
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,000
maintain

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
uh you know reduce expected uncertainty

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
about our

289
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
are thriving or survival or survival

290
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
into the future

291
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
those are though those are benef those

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
are beneficial actions

293
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
and then again by definition they're

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,959
wise actions so

295
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,920
there might be some way to actually talk

296
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
about

297
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
wisdom in the same sentence as fitness

298
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,160
right the the two cons two concepts

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
concepts

300
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,800
must be closely related

301
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
okay john can i ask i have uh two things

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,480
i

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
wrote down so one was cognition

304
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
and when we talk about multi-scale

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
cognition especially with a

306
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,399
computational or a modeling bent it's

307
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,160
easy to get caught up with cognition

308
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,839
being a really mechanical process

309
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,920
but i liked how you brought it to wisdom

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
and so it's like if we're gonna be a

311
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,399
cognitive

312
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,920
system or if that's a framework we're

313
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,320
taking are we gonna be calculators

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
and just do zero through nine

315
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
calculations or will there be wisdom

316
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
in the system and that kind of brings me

317
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
to the question which is

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
clarifying wisdom is is a big

319
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,959
opportunity

320
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,839
but also there are risks and

321
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,880
uncertainties so

322
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
here you know in 2021 looking forward

323
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
potentially to some type of

324
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
wisdom transformation what can we

325
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
cling to and how can we follow wisdom

326
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
because it sounds like a great idea but

327
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
then how will we know it in the midst

328
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
right right okay so uh your i'll talk to

329
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
your first point

330
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
uh first that excellent so so i i want

331
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,519
to

332
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
emphasize that we're not talking about

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
building a society of

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,639
robotic you know

335
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,800
linear thinking logical

336
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
organisms you know that's not really

337
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,920
what humans are

338
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
anyway that's what no organisms are you

339
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,600
know we

340
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
every organism has uh

341
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
you know some degree of complexity of of

342
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,560
its

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,480
of itself and uh humans are very complex

344
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
it will talk about the complexity of

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
human needs in a moment but

346
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
this it's life is not all about logic

347
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
and uh it is partly about uh you know a

348
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
good share of it is about heart

349
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
and intuition and all the other

350
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
emotion and all the other aspects that

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
come to play

352
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
in in what it means to be human so i'll

353
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
repeat something i had said earlier too

354
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,880
is uh you know the if we are to build

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,000
better societal systems better societies

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
those would be societies that would help

357
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,079
us be ourselves more

358
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,880
help us be true to ourselves more true

359
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
to our hearts more true to our

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,320
deepest longings more so i'm certainly

361
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
not talking about

362
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,040
uh building a society of legislation

363
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
people doing logic or computational

364
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
logic or something like that that's not

365
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
at all what this is about

366
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
this is about being more human more

367
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,480
ourselves

368
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
more capable of of uh

369
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
making wise decisions right yep and

370
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
and i think some of these ideas from the

371
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,399
you know from over that that have been

372
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
developed say in the last 10 years of

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
science

374
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,839
ideas from complex systems science ideas

375
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,120
from cognitive science

376
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,199
ideas from active inference ideas from

377
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
evolutionary biology and some others

378
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
are we're in a much better position

379
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:13,839
today

380
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,639
to be talking about you know how how

381
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
might we do this how might we build

382
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,399
systems that actually recognize the full

383
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
human the full society the full the full

384
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,959
interactions and then

385
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,320
and then help provide guidance of of how

386
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
how that might best be done right yeah

387
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,880
just one quick point on that is

388
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
people have talked about general systems

389
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
theory and about how we could simulate

390
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,199
or

391
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
choose utilitarian outcomes or all these

392
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,320
different ideas that have been

393
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
percolating for truly thousands of years

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
in many cultures what's different well

395
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
in your pocket

396
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,959
there's something that can simulate not

397
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
the universe but it can do

398
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,240
calculations that complement human

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
abilities in a really potentially

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,839
beneficial way

401
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
that's different it's on a continuum

402
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
with other extended cognitive

403
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
elements like books and communications

404
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
telecommunications media and things like

405
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
that but we're in a computational

406
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
and a conceptual phase that's totally

407
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
novel

408
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
and so we need to consider um classical

409
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,839
critiques like

410
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
it can't be done it won't be done amidst

411
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,120
the

412
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
truly ongoing changes that's right

413
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,839
actually

414
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,399
exponentially uh expanding

415
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,360
capacities for computation but your

416
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
point is very well taken this

417
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
again i do not mean that we're going to

418
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,399
have computers

419
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
deciding our every action it's not at

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,320
all what i'm talking about i'm talking

421
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
about becoming more human and using the

422
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
tools that we have available to extend

423
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
our computation and help us to

424
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,079
understand

425
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
better with the you know the

426
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
complexities of the world around us

427
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,639
right so uh right so this is this is uh

428
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,720
humans taking advantage of all the tools

429
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
they have to become

430
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,680
more themselves and better and wiser and

431
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,079
and

432
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,839
better decision making better decision

433
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,079
makers

434
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,880
okay so uh then so that's what that's

435
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
what we're gonna cover

436
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,079
today uh this first part and then we'll

437
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,320
move on to part two

438
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
all right next slide all right four four

439
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
so um so this is a slide on uh active

440
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,839
inference and i just want to put

441
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
again for those who maybe are not too

442
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,199
familiar with the concept i want to give

443
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:27,519
a

444
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,120
kind of a brief overview um excellent

445
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
uh carl friskin obviously is

446
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,240
one of the you know the main forces

447
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,720
behind

448
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
this concept he's been working on it for

449
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,120
well over a decade now

450
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
uh uh there's a little image there on

451
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
the left of the slide that i'll just

452
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
say a few words about so we can talk

453
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
about

454
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
two uh components to the universe

455
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,399
uh the universe at large and then

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
some individual that is in some sense

457
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,240
separate from the universe

458
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,280
right so uh the the

459
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,000
concept of an individual is something

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
that is that can be demarcated from the

461
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
rest of its background so for the moment

462
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,799
we'll say there's

463
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,160
we're going to draw a circle around the

464
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
individual and then the rest of the

465
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
world is going to be

466
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
outside that circle so the rest of the

467
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,439
universe has

468
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
hidden states it has a you could say it

469
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,440
has kind of a

470
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
in a sense a generative model of how it

471
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
works how it functions

472
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,520
uh when it is when it has

473
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,799
you know is is is acted upon by an

474
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
individual it responds in some way it

475
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,320
has in a sense it has a model to do that

476
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
and the individual has a model of what

477
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
the individual

478
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
how it understands the larger picture

479
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
now obviously the universe

480
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
is bigger than a human mind so there is

481
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
no way that a human

482
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
mind is ever going to understand every

483
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
little detail about the universe that's

484
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,400
impossible so um a human then or any

485
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
really any individual is faced with this

486
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
problem of

487
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,080
trying to act in a universe that is far

488
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,799
more complex far more complicated and

489
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,200
and

490
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,720
dangerous at times so how do you how do

491
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
you act

492
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
under uncertainty that's the problem of

493
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
humans and other organisms how do you

494
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
make good decisions under uncertainty

495
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
and that's certainly the problem for

496
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,360
society too how do you make good

497
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,039
decisions wise decisions

498
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,240
under uncertainty so

499
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,200
a uh when we talk about separating the

500
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
individual from the rest of the universe

501
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
we're talking statistically we're

502
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
talking about independence from the rest

503
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,760
of the universe

504
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,400
and in this line of thinking that

505
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
independence is granted by what's called

506
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
a markov blanket

507
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
so the individual knows its

508
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,960
own beliefs or it has its own beliefs

509
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,360
and

510
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
it can choose actions and it can receive

511
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
sensations from the world so it can act

512
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
and it can observe

513
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
the the result of its actions

514
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
and then the universe on the other half

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
the universe is impacted by actions and

516
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
then

517
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
changes in some way has some dynamics

518
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
and then that leads to sensations

519
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
for the individual and then the

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
individual receives a sensation so we

521
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
have kind of a circular

522
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
pattern going on here where the uh the

523
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
individual acts

524
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
well maybe we'll say this way the

525
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
individual receives sensations

526
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
after some action receive sensations

527
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,880
from the universe

528
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,720
and then it can do really one of two

529
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
things it can

530
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
it can it can alter its beliefs about

531
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,240
the world maybe

532
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,039
maybe the sensations tell the individual

533
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
that it was wrong in some ways so maybe

534
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
one option then is for the the

535
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
individual to

536
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,640
update its beliefs about the world

537
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
that's uh new here

538
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
or it can take some kind of action to

539
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
better fit the work better fit his

540
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,919
experience

541
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
to to how it understands the world so if

542
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,679
i'm

543
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,559
cold if my sensation is being pulled my

544
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,120
action might be to put on a coat so that

545
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,600
i

546
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
don't freeze to death right i can bring

547
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,440
the world

548
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
a like try to align the world with what

549
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,600
i expect the world to

550
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
to what i expect of myself and what i

551
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
expect of my own condition

552
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
and how i expect the world to act so

553
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,799
that's the

554
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
that's the kind of the two options we

555
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
have available we can update our

556
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
understanding and beliefs about the

557
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,240
world

558
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,120
and we can choose actions uh so that's

559
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,919
really the

560
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,400
gist of what that picture is and then

561
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
over on the left

562
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
on the right hand side i have a few

563
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
equations that sort of puts that into

564
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
kind of a

565
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,620
formulative

566
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,280
[Music]

567
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,440
way so the first one that was just

568
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,559
that's that's as

569
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,200
just a slide taken from wikipedia but

570
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,039
the concept is that

571
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,440
because i'm an individual and because i

572
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,559
don't

573
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
i can't actually know what the

574
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
generative process of the universe is

575
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
i can only know my sensations and and

576
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
and my actions

577
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,799
i would like to reduce

578
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
the surprise that appears

579
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
like i don't you know it's surprising to

580
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
me if i'm cold and sick and hungry

581
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,880
and harmed right i don't want those

582
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
kinds of surprises

583
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,440
i want some certainty about me existing

584
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
into the future but the trouble is

585
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,919
i don't know what the world's model is

586
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,400
so

587
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
i have to essentially create my own

588
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,559
version of it

589
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,080
that's the the density q

590
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,520
in this model i'm going to create a

591
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,919
my best guess as to how the universe

592
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,960
works

593
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,320
and uh the universe has the density

594
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,080
p in this equation

595
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,840
and uh i'm going to do something

596
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,360
actually that is it's not

597
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,880
really common in data science so if

598
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
any data scientists are listening there

599
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
you ought to be probably

600
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
very familiar with these concepts

601
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
already this is a

602
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
variational inference so it's a

603
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
technique widely used in data science to

604
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,799
solve problems and it and the id that's

605
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,400
the central idea is

606
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,320
you you have some complicated density p

607
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,400
and you don't really know how to deal

608
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
with it so

609
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
you do you instead choose a much simpler

610
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,400
density q that is more better behaved

611
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
and then you work with that and the and

612
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the whole idea is if

613
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
if if you bring q closer and closer

614
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
to p then you'll be closer and closer to

615
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
actually having a

616
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,919
model of the real model of the world so

617
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,200
uh just in that term for the elbow the

618
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
evidence lower bound is it's called in

619
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,640
data science

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
there's a kl terminal divergence term

621
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
and that just simply means that term

622
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,760
will go to zero

623
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,799
as p and q come closer

624
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,000
and the other term there uh log log

625
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,679
p uh that is really

626
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
just the negative that is called

627
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,799
surprise

628
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,159
so uh um you

629
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,440
the agent i would like to reduce the

630
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,400
surprise that it it it uh

631
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
recognizes experiences

632
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
and uh and doing and one way to do that

633
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,880
is to

634
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,919
uh is to also bring

635
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
the the densities p and q closer so you

636
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,480
get a good model of the universe

637
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,960
and you act and act in a in a way that

638
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,559
is consistent with your understanding of

639
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,679
the universe

640
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
and you update your beliefs as necessary

641
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
to be have a better model of the

642
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,919
universe

643
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
and if you do all of that the your

644
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
surprise

645
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
about how the universe acts and you're

646
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
surprised about

647
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,279
maintaining yourself into the future

648
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,679
will be will be reduced

649
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,200
so uh that's that that functional is

650
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
called a free energy

651
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
functional and the whole concept is an

652
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
active inference is to use this

653
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
action updating uh observing from the

654
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
universe what the sensations are

655
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
and then going in a circle and and

656
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,000
updating an action

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and updating an action of you know

658
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
updating action

659
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
observation updating action observation

660
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,240
so

661
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,600
uh the the the

662
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,760
the idea is to reduce this functional of

663
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
free energy

664
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,279
and that fristen

665
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
i would say claims that

666
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,919
this is what all organisms are doing

667
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
this is what life is doing

668
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,520
and if this doing so leads to

669
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
really all the structural diversity that

670
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,640
we

671
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,679
that we are aware of in our universe the

672
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,080
ecologies and ecosystems and organisms

673
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,480
and cooperating cells within a human

674
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,960
body

675
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
and all of that is is is

676
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
uh has has has become what it

677
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
has become through a process

678
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,559
through this free energy minimization

679
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,760
process

680
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,520
so uh so in a sense if we wanted to

681
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,360
somehow uh

682
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,400
talk rigorously about wisdom it would be

683
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
in some sense

684
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,520
at least you know from this perspective

685
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
it would be

686
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
wise actions and and

687
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,279
learning activities and explorations

688
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,480
wisdom is

689
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,440
the kind of equivalent to reducing

690
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
expected free energy i just want to make

691
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,520
a just a few

692
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,880
other comments here is this

693
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
this is the simple this page is the

694
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
simple version so

695
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,679
uh what we really want to do is is

696
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
reduce expected free energy like

697
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,840
what will happen you know a tiger is

698
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,640
running at me

699
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,679
i could run i could fight

700
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,720
i could jump on a car i could jump in a

701
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,120
car

702
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,279
i could do all these things i have these

703
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,480
options paths

704
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
these paths i could take these decisions

705
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,679
i could take

706
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,559
which of them is going to be best for me

707
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
in the long run

708
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
or in the short run and so that

709
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,320
requires expectations of free energy

710
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,679
over possible

711
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,919
decisions of the in the future and that

712
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,520
becomes quite complicated

713
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,400
none of that is really in this slide but

714
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,600
i do want do you want

715
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,360
to everyone to realize that that's there

716
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,799
john i want to lock in

717
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,679
two really key points that you touched

718
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,440
on here and then ask a question

719
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,200
so the first is the first thing you said

720
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
on this slide is

721
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
active inference is about the reduction

722
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
of uncertainty so

723
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,279
that's in direct contrast with the

724
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,640
human as an economic maximizer or an

725
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
optimizer of the reward or that we're

726
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,039
trying to do some sort of

727
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,480
optimization maximization on an outcome

728
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
it's a process-based reduction of

729
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,240
uncertainty that active inference

730
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,039
highlights

731
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,880
and so of course you're highlighting the

732
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
outcomes that we want to see those are

733
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,480
our values our preferences

734
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,960
and our predictions we hope but we're

735
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
going about it with a process

736
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,279
based and uncertainty reduction based

737
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:37,919
lens

738
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,640
rather than simply like number is going

739
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,440
to go up

740
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,520
we got to get there so that's the

741
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
richness

742
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
of just if nothing else all the

743
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,159
critiques of active immigrants aside

744
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,360
to focus on the process and the

745
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
reduction of uncertainty is really

746
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,440
powerful

747
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
and the second lock in is you

748
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,279
immediately went from the reduction of

749
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,240
uncertainty

750
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,159
to collective behavior and it's like

751
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
there's things that the brain knows that

752
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,720
a neuron

753
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,960
doesn't like how to speak english and

754
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,320
there's things the colony

755
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
knows and does that the ant nest mate

756
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
doesn't so part of this

757
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
is about realizing well there's things

758
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,520
surely society knows

759
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,600
with all of our diversity and all of our

760
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,559
different skills

761
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,360
that an individual doesn't so what does

762
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,679
it look like to take that seriously

763
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,919
that the cognitive systems are not just

764
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,600
nested internally like

765
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,440
well the brain the brain region the

766
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
neural circuit the neuron the organelle

767
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
yeah you can go down but you can go out

768
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,080
and it's not just a cope and so what

769
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
that looks like is a really

770
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,919
important point so the two things there

771
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,440
reduction of uncertainty with active

772
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,080
inference

773
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,559
and multi-scale cognitive systems and

774
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,440
it's really

775
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
important points um good or can i ask

776
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,000
the question

777
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
no excellent excellent yeah go ahead i'm

778
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,120
just trying to catch up because

779
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
you say a lot of awesome points in each

780
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,399
of these

781
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,799
breakdowns and the question is really um

782
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,640
what kinds this is on the jamboard

783
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,120
what kinds of social processes or data

784
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,240
are promising

785
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
for active inference modeling let's just

786
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,520
say now

787
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
maybe in the future we'll license other

788
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,200
deployments

789
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
but right now like what kind of data

790
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,559
would you be curious to

791
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,120
collect or find out about we may talk

792
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,760
about it

793
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
later in the economic or social context

794
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
but what kind of data types are we

795
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,919
thinking about

796
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
making active inference models of

797
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,799
yeah okay so to answer that question

798
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,000
um uh i'm i'm going to ask that question

799
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
in about two more slides so i'm going to

800
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,200
ask that very question

801
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,520
to you and to the viewers out there

802
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
but i'll do i can give you just one

803
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,880
that's simple okay we can come back to

804
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,279
it but

805
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,039
go for an example yeah i'll just i'll

806
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
give one example uh because i also want

807
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
to emphasize something else that you

808
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,679
also just very briefly touched on so uh

809
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,320
and

810
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,159
also i had touched on but i want to

811
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,960
emphasize that if we're talking about

812
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,720
expected uncertainty

813
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,000
that implies that we

814
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,960
are anticipatory so i just want to

815
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
underline

816
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
that every organism is anticipatory

817
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,919
every organism is doing

818
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,720
this reducing free energy you know i

819
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
mean from this view

820
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,840
and that requires anticipation of

821
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,440
what the future will be and

822
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
so so anticipation

823
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,880
or you might call it forecasting

824
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,919
forecasting

825
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,679
is central to um

826
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,840
our our well-being our our continued

827
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,600
existence i'm forecasting that if i see

828
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,679
a tiger coming towards me

829
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,320
that it's i'm gonna be it's lunch if i

830
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,200
don't do something

831
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
so uh you know that's i if we don't

832
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
we don't think clearly about what's to

833
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,320
happen next

834
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,200
then cognition is there is no hardly any

835
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
cognition

836
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
just one one short comment on that is

837
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,440
anticipation

838
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,200
and anticipatory systems has been

839
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,880
discussed in many other

840
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,039
contexts like cybernetics and active

841
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,559
inference helps us walk

842
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,480
from this very simple beginning you said

843
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
okay there's an inside and outside

844
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,080
if you don't have that you know you need

845
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
to think a little bit more clearly about

846
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,960
the system or something like that but

847
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
we can start with the simplest and then

848
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,279
we can build it out to the sophisticated

849
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,600
affect of inference with the affective

850
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,360
charge and all these other

851
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
modern models but we're starting with

852
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:26,880
this

853
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
loop which is why we always come back to

854
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
these kinds of figures and why it's

855
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,000
really important that you're making it

856
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
at this level right

857
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,720
good uh so uh just so so we can ask the

858
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,279
question

859
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
uh all right

860
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,200
you know tell me like

861
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,519
kinds of things what does this want to

862
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,840
be good at forecasting

863
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,559
uh and you know actually i'll ask this

864
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,840
question a few slides so we don't have

865
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,320
to go too far into it now but

866
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,919
let's just just just take say governance

867
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,039
uh or leaders political leaders if

868
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,919
they if a political leader unders is

869
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,880
good at

870
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,399
understanding what's coming next what

871
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,159
the future is going to be then great

872
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,840
then the political leader can say hey we

873
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
better do something because

874
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,840
if we don't this thing is going to

875
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
happen right

876
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,679
but as a society today do we actually

877
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,320
remember

878
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,240
those predictions do we in any way like

879
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,960
you know score accuracy of people's

880
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
predictions or the predictions of

881
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
science or the predictions of

882
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
organizations is there

883
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,480
like how does society today remember

884
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
remember that predictions have been made

885
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
and now the future is has evolved and

886
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,399
come about

887
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,200
and how who was good at who was going to

888
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
anticipate in the future

889
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,000
who who excels what

890
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,399
what what what organization or political

891
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,039
group or

892
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,279
whatever who's been really good at

893
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,039
understanding what's going to come next

894
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,000
right

895
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
so that's just i'll just leave that an

896
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
open question

897
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,760
because that you know it gets the mind

898
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,440
working out that you can think of all

899
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
kinds of

900
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
ways that we don't do a good job of

901
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
of remembering and anticipating today

902
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
just to ask a question from the chat um

903
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
someone wrote does john use active

904
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,240
inference

905
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,559
mathematical framework in his work for

906
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,720
merely descriptive purposes

907
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
so potentially as opposed to generative

908
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,679
or like real-time decision making so

909
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,760
where does where are you right now or

910
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,960
where do you want to be with

911
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,480
respect to using active inference to

912
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
describe simulate

913
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
make decision support etc right right

914
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,600
yeah

915
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,640
a good question so and maybe

916
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,320
maybe the part of the answer to that

917
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
question is to is to tell you what stage

918
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,480
this project is at

919
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,279
so the the series has just been

920
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,320
published

921
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,760
this uh the series proposes a

922
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,080
r d program uh that we that

923
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,360
that we that society could undertake and

924
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,760
uh

925
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,918
it is conceptual at the moment uh the

926
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,760
the whole program is conceptual it's not

927
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,520
been funded it's it's

928
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
i mean you're in a sense you're looking

929
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,960
at it this is it

930
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,719
it's the three papers and our

931
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,000
conversation and

932
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
whatever you know other people have to

933
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,359
add to this

934
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,239
so uh this is where we're at we're we're

935
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,119
obviously

936
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,679
focusing or i'm focusing now on the the

937
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,960
kind of the

938
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
the big picture conceptual ideas because

939
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
that has to

940
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,520
it's that has to happen before you

941
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
actually get into the nuts and bolts of

942
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,280
okay how do we use this what how does

943
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
this go what kind of models can we build

944
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,359
but uh i would guess and i would expect

945
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,879
that if this project moves forward

946
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,879
then at some point we'll be talking

947
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,000
about the

948
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,719
numerous ways that the society uses

949
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,520
information

950
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,800
and how it remembers and how it

951
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
anticipates and

952
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
what models might be used for different

953
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,359
kinds of intuition participation

954
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,560
and um and you know

955
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,000
how do the nuts and bolts of that go

956
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,079
together so that's to come

957
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,119
that's the research project to come

958
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,560
and i hope i hope we get a chance to go

959
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
there that would be fantastic

960
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,400
we'll lay it out as likely and then

961
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
we'll make it happen okay there we go

962
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,880
there we go

963
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
all right so uh so that's that slides go

964
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,640
on to the next

965
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,079
sounds good five yeah and and maybe

966
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,640
two you know before we move off the last

967
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,119
slide

968
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
i i do want to say that active inference

969
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,240
has this

970
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,119
wonderful uh part of it that i'm very

971
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,320
attracted to

972
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,160
and that is that it it provides

973
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,040
a way for an organism acting in its

974
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,079
environment

975
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,280
to play it by ear to to

976
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
to learn as it goes to be to have a

977
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,280
process

978
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
of learning a goal for

979
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
learning an action that can evolve over

980
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,320
time

981
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
right so so so if we were gonna program

982
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,040
an active inference robot

983
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
we would not be giving it a formula for

984
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,560
you know do

985
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,760
this 10 points do that five points now

986
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
find a way to act in the world where you

987
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,880
where you

988
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
you know maximize the number of points

989
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,400
you can get it's not really like that

990
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,359
and the world is

991
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,520
for for for in a real setting the world

992
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,200
is far too complex

993
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,599
for someone to pre-program how many

994
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,520
points you get for certain

995
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
activities or reaching certain goals

996
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,640
right so

997
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,160
a intelligent agent has to be able to

998
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,280
alter its its understanding of the world

999
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,079
and its goals at the same time to and

1000
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,599
we'll talk about this again but to

1001
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,640
balance

1002
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,280
exploitation of what it knows already to

1003
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
use what it knows about the

1004
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
current situation and exploration

1005
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,119
jumping into new uh new unknowns

1006
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,440
uh considering new proposals concerning

1007
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,880
new rearrangements

1008
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,920
so so the so active inference and really

1009
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,480
the

1010
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,440
structural development and evolution of

1011
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
all of life and ecosystems and cells and

1012
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,720
communications

1013
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,680
between organisms and all of that is is

1014
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,240
kind of

1015
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,160
built on this balance between

1016
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
exploitation and exploration and you

1017
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,240
might think of that in various ways

1018
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,359
between old and new um you could even

1019
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,200
think of that in terms of

1020
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
like in modern day society to a degree

1021
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
you could even think of it in terms of

1022
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,160
liberal political versus conservative

1023
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,440
political in their best sense that is a

1024
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
you know conservative political might be

1025
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,480
more

1026
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,720
more interested in relying on tradition

1027
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,079
and then

1028
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,280
exploiting their current knowledge and

1029
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
perhaps a liberal might be more

1030
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,839
interested in exploring new ideas and

1031
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,880
and taking the leaps of you know into

1032
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
the into the unknown to

1033
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,400
to learn something new and do and do

1034
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
something better to improve a process to

1035
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,079
change a process right so decision

1036
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,920
making is very much a balance between

1037
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
those two

1038
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,160
uh exploitation exploration and active

1039
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
inference provides a mechanism

1040
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,440
by which that can occur quite naturally

1041
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,160
and

1042
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,320
i won't even go into detail to say that

1043
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,400
an action model and reducing uncertainty

1044
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,680
on that helps you act in

1045
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,440
unknown unknowns i think it's something

1046
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
unknown unknowns that's correct yeah of

1047
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,839
which there are

1048
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,000
plenty all right now slide five

1049
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,560
uh i guess this is following up on

1050
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
active inference just a bit

1051
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,960
um and i think we've talked on most of

1052
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,839
these things

1053
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,119
uh the uh

1054
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,800
yeah i think we have great the whole the

1055
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,160
whole point is to resolve

1056
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,119
expected uncertainty great so okay good

1057
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,599
so

1058
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
next six

1059
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,800
all right so i just want to touch a a

1060
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,960
few just a few ideas on cooperation and

1061
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,000
communication

1062
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,680
so uh actually cooperation and

1063
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
communication are

1064
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
you know go hand in hand right they may

1065
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,960
have even evolved

1066
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,720
together possibly so um

1067
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,839
cooperation is the is it

1068
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,800
really is almost the rule in the in the

1069
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,079
in our world

1070
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,520
life cooperates in so many ways

1071
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
so many ways and the more we study it

1072
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,839
the more we realize how deep

1073
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,079
the cooperative cooperation is with you

1074
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,359
know within a

1075
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,280
species within a within between species

1076
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,160
between trees and fungus between within

1077
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,200
ecosystems

1078
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
between ecosystems i mean it's just

1079
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
cooperation is everywhere and as i said

1080
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,480
last

1081
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
in our last show if you want evidence of

1082
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,760
it that is

1083
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,359
if you want mind-blowing evidence and

1084
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,680
cooperation just think of your own body

1085
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
the trillion of cells that are

1086
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,640
cooperating to for you to be what you

1087
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,320
are right

1088
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,920
so um cooperation exists everywhere

1089
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,040
and it is nearly impossible without

1090
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,760
communication

1091
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
like you cannot cooperate with someone

1092
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,040
if you don't co-op communicate

1093
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,520
and the richer the communication the at

1094
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,960
least potentially the richer the

1095
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,200
cooperation

1096
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,599
um and obviously by cooperation i mean

1097
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,119
black communication i mean honest

1098
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,680
communication

1099
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,240
dishonest communication is hardly

1100
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,920
communication right so we're talking

1101
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
about honest

1102
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,800
exchanges between cells between people

1103
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,720
between societies um

1104
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,880
so it's interesting though that you know

1105
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,920
like to take your

1106
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,839
body for example you have all these

1107
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,440
trillion cells

1108
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,400
and they don't have to cooperate i mean

1109
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,240
there's you know they cannot cooperate

1110
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,079
and sometimes they don't cooperate with

1111
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,000
each other

1112
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
and they can act independently to some

1113
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,520
degree

1114
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
right so there's always throughout the

1115
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
universe there's this tension

1116
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,440
between what cooperation provides

1117
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,880
and what the individual

1118
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
you know what the individual might want

1119
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
to how it might want to behave

1120
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,119
if it were just left to its own to its

1121
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,319
own right

1122
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,599
so why would anything cooperate

1123
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,640
and and the the kind of the big picture

1124
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,200
answered that question is because it

1125
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
reduces expected uncertainty it's

1126
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,640
again the it reduces free energy

1127
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
so by cooperation a

1128
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,319
an organism can assure itself of

1129
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,760
survival it can

1130
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,839
make its survival easier it can make

1131
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,000
communication easier it can

1132
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,839
you know do have all these benefits

1133
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,319
right

1134
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,599
so nevertheless every given moment

1135
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
is this there's this tenuous balance

1136
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
between you know do i continue to

1137
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,800
cooperate

1138
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,079
in this in this sphere or or

1139
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,720
or not and who and who is and at what

1140
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,800
to what extent do i cooperate do i

1141
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
cooperate within my

1142
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,839
uh family and

1143
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,440
or in my community and in and or in my

1144
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,079
society

1145
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,920
and or between societies that like at

1146
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,000
what level am i interested

1147
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
in cooperating right and the

1148
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
you know the answer the general answer

1149
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,480
that question is i am interested in

1150
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,040
cooperating on every level in which

1151
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,680
uncertain my uncertainty is reduced my

1152
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
my vitality is insured and my

1153
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,200
uncertainty is reduced right

1154
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,839
so it crossed the layers across scales

1155
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,800
but we do see this

1156
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,319
examples of when cooperation fails and

1157
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,040
one example that i like to use is the

1158
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
example of cancer in a body

1159
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,079
the cells cells

1160
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,560
transform cells start to not cooperate

1161
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,440
with the uh the uh you know with their

1162
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,119
milieu with their tissues with their

1163
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,200
with their environment so uh

1164
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,480
so my question for listeners

1165
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
is uh so we have an idea of what

1166
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,319
cooperation means

1167
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,680
and then what is the opposite of

1168
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,399
cooperation

1169
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,440
like you might think okay well the

1170
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,319
opposite of cooperation is selfishness

1171
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,960
and i would i would suggest you know

1172
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,359
maybe

1173
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,359
in certain circumstances that seems

1174
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,560
pretty clear but

1175
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,800
in a more general sense maybe that's not

1176
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
the opposite of cooperation

1177
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,599
right maybe maybe there's

1178
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
almost always cooperation and what

1179
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:42,960
changes

1180
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,000
is the extent of self of the

1181
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,640
agent or you know the organism that's

1182
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,440
that that is

1183
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,880
taking the action for example

1184
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
cancer cells cooperate with you know

1185
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,359
they cooperate with each other at least

1186
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,160
so um and they and they might cooperate

1187
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,960
within their

1188
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,760
you know within their very small tumor

1189
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,359
milieu

1190
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,720
there's a lot of communication that

1191
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,400
happens between cancer cells once a

1192
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,160
cancer forms a tremendous

1193
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,760
communication that goes on between

1194
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,920
cancer cells

1195
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,480
so maybe it's not maybe it's not so

1196
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,960
useful for us to think of cooperation

1197
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
versus selfishness but rather

1198
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,920
cooperation as a as a scale

1199
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,960
scales of cooperation in the extent like

1200
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,880
am i cooperating with my immediate

1201
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,640
family with my

1202
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,480
you know like or or or am i cooperating

1203
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,880
with

1204
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,359
societies that are far-flung and halfway

1205
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,040
across the world right

1206
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,440
to to the degree that we understand

1207
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,560
ourself

1208
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,520
to be extended we are cooperating with

1209
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,400
ourself

1210
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,040
i mean you have to understand that right

1211
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,839
if i understand that i am part of this

1212
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,280
environment this ecology then my

1213
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
any actions i take to benefit the

1214
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,280
ecology are actions that i take to

1215
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,240
benefit myself

1216
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,440
right so if my sense of self is extended

1217
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,160
out

1218
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,800
to the world to the or to the degree

1219
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,720
that it's extended out to the world

1220
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,079
i am interested in cooperating

1221
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,520
with myself to better myself to reduce

1222
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,800
my overall

1223
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,800
uncertainty right so cancer perhaps is

1224
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,319
it's not really a matter of being

1225
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,160
selfish perhaps like i can't you know

1226
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,720
people say

1227
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,400
cancers are really selfish they're just

1228
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,839
gonna they're just gonna

1229
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
you know only pay attention to what's

1230
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,359
good for them

1231
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,880
yeah but that but they're cooperating

1232
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,560
they're cooperating with a smaller group

1233
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,079
and because they're cooperating with a

1234
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,680
smaller group and that because their

1235
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,760
extensive self is reduced

1236
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
their capacity for cognition is reduced

1237
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,760
and

1238
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,200
you know we're talking we're just kind

1239
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,800
of anthropomorphic here but

1240
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,280
you know they they they would have a

1241
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
small tumor would have a

1242
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
more difficult time understanding the

1243
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,640
long-term effects

1244
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,040
their long-term effects because their

1245
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,200
their cognitive

1246
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,800
data is to a small

1247
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,680
set of cells versus the human body which

1248
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,400
has

1249
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
the full cooperation of the brain and

1250
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,440
the feet and the

1251
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
hands and the understanding and the

1252
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,640
capacity to

1253
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,240
use your mouth to ask others what's

1254
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,079
going to happen next right so

1255
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,160
the more you the more you're the more

1256
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,920
you extend into the world and are

1257
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,839
cooperating with the world the larger

1258
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,319
your

1259
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,560
cognitive capacity the larger your

1260
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,400
problem solving capacity

1261
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,880
and the better you will be at

1262
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,079
understanding

1263
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,280
in the long term you know the outcomes

1264
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,400
of your actions and

1265
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,440
how that's going to affect your own um

1266
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,880
you know how it's going to affect you as

1267
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
an individual and you as an extended

1268
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,440
self

1269
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,680
okay so i got a little off there but uh

1270
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,119
you know what i'm just saying

1271
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,920
cooperation is everywhere and it's all

1272
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,400
about

1273
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,520
communication and shared computational

1274
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,240
capacity and shared decision making

1275
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,790
the potential for more more

1276
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,849
[Music]

1277
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,640
cognitive capacity and better decision

1278
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,480
making great

1279
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,720
the only point i'd make here as a ant

1280
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,920
researcher and

1281
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,200
have thought about conflict and

1282
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,960
cooperation across scales

1283
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,720
is that it's really a story we're

1284
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
telling about a certain outcome

1285
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,400
like when the white blood cell eats a

1286
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,800
cancer cell is that altruism at the

1287
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,319
higher level is it a conflict at the

1288
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,200
lower level

1289
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,119
so it's a scale-dependent and it's often

1290
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,319
a perspectival

1291
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,160
narrative that we're telling about what

1292
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,079
cooperation is

1293
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,800
and um it's just like yin and yang

1294
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,480
there's a compliment between what we

1295
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,240
call cooperation and communication

1296
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,680
they're like the good guy and the bad

1297
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
guy they come into existence

1298
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,400
when we have fitness and free energy to

1299
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,280
dissipate

1300
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,880
so we need a story that allows us to act

1301
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,559
in that gray zone instead of

1302
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,480
getting fatalistic about competition or

1303
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,400
getting utopian about cooperation

1304
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,200
because this

1305
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,359
is not going to be necessarily a smooth

1306
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,880
and lovey-dovey ride

1307
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,960
with cooperation nowhere is it in the

1308
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
body so it's like a very

1309
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,559
nice nuanced way and that's why we fall

1310
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,000
back to active inference

1311
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,960
rather than an ism or a specific

1312
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
metaphor

1313
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,559
of choice like the selfish gene right

1314
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:19,040
right

1315
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,119
excellent yeah and just to just to

1316
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,640
underline that

1317
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,680
this project is not about asking people

1318
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,800
to behave

1319
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
like super altruistically or something

1320
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,280
like that or to cooperate you know

1321
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,839
beyond what would be natural that that

1322
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:34,640
would never

1323
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,680
work it would fail it would fail because

1324
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,559
that's not

1325
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,319
what that's not how it work that's not

1326
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,760
how what life is doing that's not how

1327
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,960
life is working

1328
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,200
so you know we just really just need to

1329
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,319
be

1330
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,680
set up our system set up our processes

1331
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,240
set up our societal decision making you

1332
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,200
know

1333
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,160
ways we go about making decisions and

1334
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,480
just

1335
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,040
align ourselves with what we actually

1336
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,880
are and what life is actually doing and

1337
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,079
that means

1338
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,079
that there is a continual conflict

1339
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,440
between cooperation

1340
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,800
and uh you know and not cooperation

1341
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,040
between an and kind of an individualism

1342
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,760
and a more cooperative stance that's

1343
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,000
just like there's a ongoing conflict

1344
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,359
between

1345
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,640
exploitation and exploration between

1346
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,920
you know conservative and liberal

1347
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
between old information

1348
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,280
the value of old information and the

1349
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
value of new information this is a

1350
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,839
all of this is a is a dance it's a

1351
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,559
dynamic

1352
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,400
dance right so but there is a sweet spot

1353
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,920
in that dance there is a a place to

1354
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,119
hover a sphere to hover in where

1355
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,000
uh you're balancing all and new

1356
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
exploitation

1357
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,000
exploration uh conservative liberal

1358
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,800
you're balancing them and because you're

1359
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,520
on that in that sweet spot in that

1360
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,680
critical

1361
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,880
area you're able to

1362
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,040
do about the best that any organism

1363
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,000
could do under uncertainty

1364
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,119
and life the magnificence of life

1365
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,480
is the proof of that

1366
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,920
awesome two seven okay

1367
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,960
speaking of life yeah right

1368
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,680
so so uh in our last talk i had

1369
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,400
mentioned that

1370
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,079
um that complexity

1371
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,240
is uh you can you can think of it at

1372
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,599
least in a certain way you can think of

1373
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,079
it as problem solving capacity

1374
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
organisms complexify and environments

1375
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,280
complexify ecologies complexify in order

1376
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,319
to solve

1377
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,040
ever more difficult challenging problems

1378
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,079
right

1379
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,359
so it is not true that that complexity

1380
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,839
is just a path to

1381
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,960
to chaos and

1382
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,800
failure right systems do fail i mean

1383
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,160
obviously that does happen there's

1384
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
there's complex systems that can fail

1385
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,440
but by and large

1386
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,880
complexity is a path to in greater

1387
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,319
problem-solving capacity so

1388
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,000
humans are complex so you know of all

1389
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,079
the organisms on the planet we're pretty

1390
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,040
complex we have

1391
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,000
complex brains we we have complex

1392
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,160
cognitive processes we can we think

1393
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
about what might happen

1394
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,280
in a thousand years and we're concerned

1395
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,119
about what might happen in a thousand

1396
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,800
years that's you know that's seen

1397
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
that's enormously complex say com

1398
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,839
compared to

1399
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,240
a bacteria that doesn't have a central

1400
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,480
nervous system

1401
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,680
so because we're complex and this is

1402
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,359
this is true for all organisms in

1403
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,040
general that the more complex an

1404
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,680
organism is the more complex it's needs

1405
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,079
all right it's it's the more the more

1406
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,359
feelers it has out

1407
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,000
in the universe the more more extended

1408
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,319
it is into the universe in a sense

1409
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,480
and that is certainly true for humans

1410
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,880
and uh this this table is some needs

1411
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,240
according to maslo

1412
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,559
maslow and i just want to mention these

1413
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,680
as an example

1414
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,280
not not that these are the needs we

1415
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,040
should focus on but just as an example

1416
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,839
of

1417
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,839
of needs he i think he has maybe nine or

1418
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,160
eight or nine of their i think

1419
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,160
but affection we we just we want to be

1420
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,680
loved and we want to love both you know

1421
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,920
we want to share friendships it makes us

1422
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,520
happy to do that we

1423
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,079
we want to be creative we want to create

1424
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:20,960
things we want to

1425
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,440
build skills we want to have freedom to

1426
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,319
associate

1427
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,000
who with whom we want to associate and

1428
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,680
freedom to move about and look around

1429
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,040
and poke around and

1430
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,559
look under things we you know we want to

1431
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,800
participate we want to cooperate we

1432
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,119
we want to understand we want to learn

1433
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,319
learning is fun

1434
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,040
for you know hopefully learning it's fun

1435
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,520
we

1436
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,760
we want the rest when we're tired we

1437
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,880
want to

1438
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,119
get some exercise we want to move about

1439
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,000
you know

1440
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,480
we need to relax sometimes like all

1441
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,400
these things

1442
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,640
this is these are if we can call these

1443
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,720
core human needs

1444
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,440
these speak to something that i've i

1445
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,559
think briefly mentioned

1446
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,720
the last uh talk which which is called

1447
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,240
essential variables

1448
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,760
so if an organism is if it's purpose

1449
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,599
intrinsic purpose is to maintain

1450
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,000
vitality into the future

1451
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,079
well you know what what are those

1452
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,359
variables

1453
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,280
that are important in maintaining

1454
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,200
vitality you know like you can think you

1455
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,160
could think of a few

1456
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,440
important things right off the top of

1457
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,920
that like fresh water to drink

1458
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,160
you know clean air to breathe the food

1459
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,079
shelter you know like you could start to

1460
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,640
think of what some of these essential

1461
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,319
variables might be but i would like to

1462
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,319
suggest that some of these core human

1463
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,280
needs

1464
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,119
somehow fit into the concept of

1465
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,400
essential variables

1466
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,400
humans need to be humans need affection

1467
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,200
you we will be sick if we don't have

1468
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,480
affection

1469
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,319
right we will be sick if we don't have

1470
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,760
freedom we will be ill

1471
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,920
and we won't be able to and and and we

1472
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,040
won't be able to solve

1473
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,720
we won't be able to be good problem

1474
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,960
solvers in our environment if we're

1475
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,920
if we're hampered by a lack of meeting

1476
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,040
essential variables

1477
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:10,400
you know will be will be worse

1478
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,280
so the point of all that is when we

1479
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,839
think about

1480
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,559
a complex organism like a human we can

1481
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,240
think about complex needs

1482
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
and then we can think about okay so now

1483
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
it's starting to become clear when we're

1484
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,920
reducing uncertainty

1485
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,079
we're reducing uncertainty about these

1486
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,839
essential variables which might

1487
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,520
touch on things like the the eight or so

1488
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,720
nine uh core needs that i'm listing

1489
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,079
so i wanted for example i want to have

1490
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,280
i don't want to be uncertain that i will

1491
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,520
be loved in the future you know or that

1492
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,119
i'll have food to eat or that i'll be

1493
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,799
able to move about freely i would like

1494
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,559
to be fairly certain that

1495
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,160
that is i'm going to have those freedoms

1496
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
i'm going to have these needs met

1497
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,400
right and so again then we're not

1498
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,760
talking about some

1499
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,240
big computational calculator thing that

1500
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,520
for this project is this

1501
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,760
is this is about heart and soul and

1502
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,720
being a human

1503
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,359
even more human than society allows us

1504
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,079
to be

1505
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,960
today like you know society is not set

1506
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,280
up

1507
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,400
our society is not set up to

1508
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,440
to focus on providing

1509
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,160
for these complex human needs right i

1510
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
mean we have poverty we have

1511
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,079
billions of people in poverty in the

1512
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,760
world and the

1513
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,839
you that's already like all kinds of

1514
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,280
needs are not met

1515
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,760
because someone doesn't have the you

1516
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,680
know the

1517
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,799
financial capacity to

1518
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,920
to do what they need to do right so

1519
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,760
uh so uh we can

1520
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,680
we can there's one last thing on this

1521
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,599
slide this little phrase that i like to

1522
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,079
use

1523
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,319
is the solving problems that matter

1524
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,440
right so

1525
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,680
so society might solve all kinds of

1526
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,559
problems for example if i work for a

1527
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,000
manufacturer that is producing some like

1528
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,359
you know let's say a

1529
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,559
some commercial relatively

1530
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,839
useless product that people are

1531
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,160
uh that they're that people are buying

1532
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,960
because the

1533
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,720
commercialism is is pushed

1534
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,359
you know i made maybe i'm solving the

1535
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,359
immediate problem of making an income so

1536
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,240
that i can pay my rent but beyond that

1537
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,720
am i solving problems that matter you

1538
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,400
know i don't have a good example maybe

1539
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,720
someone else does the useless thing that

1540
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,359
many people do in their with their

1541
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:33,920
life's

1542
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,839
work you know their 40 hours a week is

1543
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,200
doing something

1544
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,960
useless there was a book there was a

1545
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,480
book there was a book about that a while

1546
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,319
ago and they had a phrase but

1547
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,319
i forget exactly what his phrase was

1548
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,359
well i don't know if it was a

1549
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,040
family-friendly phrase but i think i

1550
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,240
know it but yeah i don't think it was

1551
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,640
yeah

1552
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,559
i hesitate to say it because it wasn't

1553
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,440
family friends friendly

1554
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,599
you know it's like you know uh whose

1555
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,359
team our team like that kind of a call

1556
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,119
and response like which problems

1557
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,119
the ones that matter i mean then what

1558
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,480
does it mean to matter well that's our

1559
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,640
preferences and our affordances

1560
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,200
and then as far as cases where the work

1561
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,640
or the problem doesn't matter

1562
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,480
there's times where the person might

1563
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,240
think that the problem matters

1564
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,480
but when you pull back it's actually a

1565
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,079
non-linear response

1566
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,799
where even if it does matter the issue

1567
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,559
that they're concerned about

1568
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,880
that their effort may not be the most

1569
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,079
efficacious

1570
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,280
and this isn't going to go back to

1571
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,359
another optimization you must be engaged

1572
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,799
in the most efficacious

1573
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,559
um because we're actually putting space

1574
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,480
for play and identity

1575
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,240
and participation understanding all

1576
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,680
these attributes that aren't just

1577
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,920
some simple cybernetic like action

1578
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,720
selection

1579
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,160
but it's really important to keep this

1580
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
as our guiding light it's the problems

1581
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,480
and

1582
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,839
those are the salient ones the ones that

1583
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,440
matter but we need to be informed by our

1584
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,319
values

1585
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,160
yeah yeah and obviously we're talking

1586
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,359
high level here we're

1587
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,440
we're trying to give a context for this

1588
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,520
whole thing of what could society be

1589
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,760
and how would we go about measuring

1590
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,720
fitness and

1591
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,319
you know what is a society supposed to

1592
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,160
accomplish and for whom

1593
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,079
and then we have to talk about the you

1594
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,839
know these these high level

1595
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,680
concepts because they can be guides for

1596
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,160
us right so the just the phrase solving

1597
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,000
problems that matter it can be a useful

1598
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,960
guide because

1599
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,240
it remember it reminds us oh yeah what

1600
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,000
what matters and what am i doing with my

1601
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,920
life and what are we doing in society

1602
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,359
with our lives

1603
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,440
are we doing things are we solving

1604
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,799
problems that matter

1605
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,319
and you know obviously there's a whole

1606
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,000
bunch of enormous problems that we're

1607
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
not solving right

1608
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,160
like climate change and other things you

1609
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,599
know

1610
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,760
if society was solving problems that

1611
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,280
matter that would be like

1612
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,720
enormous armies of biologists and

1613
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,079
you know other people the uh ecologists

1614
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:42,319
and

1615
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,119
and field workers and all kinds of

1616
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,079
people

1617
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,079
you know focusing on the problems that

1618
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,599
matter most

1619
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,839
for for happiness and survival and

1620
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,920
currently in today's world

1621
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,160
you know that that is heating up heating

1622
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,040
up to be

1623
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,480
climate change and biodiversity loss and

1624
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:00,880
you know

1625
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,119
ecological destruction and pollution and

1626
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,040
groundwater depletion and like all the

1627
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,559
things that that

1628
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,799
were were pushed you know

1629
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,720
all the damage we've done to our to our

1630
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,559
world

1631
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,359
certainly cleaning those problems up

1632
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,880
ought to be

1633
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,000
among the problems that matter okay

1634
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,200
so uh there we go i think uh

1635
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,440
uh one last thing on this slide photo or

1636
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,880
in the bottom right

1637
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,119
i i bring the topic of culture in

1638
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,040
and i just want to just say a word about

1639
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,160
culture from an

1640
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,680
active enforcement a viewpoint so

1641
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,119
you know at its best culture

1642
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,480
is a remembering of what is important

1643
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,720
to teach you know to to not only to

1644
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,319
teach new people to

1645
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,960
each new you know new young adults as

1646
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,760
they

1647
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,040
mature what's important but also to

1648
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,319
to offload some of the computational

1649
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,400
burden that individuals would otherwise

1650
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,359
face so

1651
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,200
if i have to figure out everything for

1652
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,680
myself from you know from scratch as an

1653
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,400
organism

1654
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,440
oh that's tough it is so much easier for

1655
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,559
my for me

1656
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,359
if my peers you know point me in the

1657
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,079
right direction

1658
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,760
tell me you know give me some indication

1659
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,839
of what's dangerous what's not dangerous

1660
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,599
what's important what's not important

1661
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,400
give me some guidance i can learn so

1662
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,440
much faster if i have some good guidance

1663
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
and uh and also if i can just rely on

1664
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,559
culture to

1665
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,880
just to you know like okay you know my

1666
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,599
culture

1667
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,799
does this thing and i'm not gonna maybe

1668
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,559
even think about it too deeply because

1669
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,559
i'm you know like if my culture is good

1670
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,559
it's maybe reflecting in some

1671
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,839
capacity this importance of putting

1672
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,880
attention on those things that matter

1673
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,440
right so now we've now talked about two

1674
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,880
important things here actually

1675
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,160
uh culture and how culture relates to uh

1676
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,359
to the reduction of uncertainty overall

1677
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,760
and then uh also attention and the role

1678
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,400
of culture

1679
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,559
in directing attention so those are

1680
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,760
themes that we'll

1681
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,799
be coming back on nice so

1682
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,200
attention attention and essential

1683
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,520
variables you know like

1684
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,200
those go together right if we've not

1685
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,640
obtained attention to essential

1686
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,440
variables

1687
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,400
then our whole free energy minimization

1688
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,040
thing is

1689
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,119
not functioning correctly right because

1690
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,880
we have to put attention on those things

1691
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,280
that are important

1692
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,040
okay all right next all right so now we

1693
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,720
get to the slide where i get to ask you

1694
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,200
and

1695
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,319
any any listeners like what does this

1696
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,079
mean practically so we've talked about

1697
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,440
all these high level concepts we've

1698
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,880
given

1699
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,200
some context for you know for who we are

1700
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,720
and what we might need and

1701
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,640
what a what a societal system is

1702
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,920
supposed to do

1703
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,000
and those were all fairly high level

1704
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,680
disc

1705
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,760
discussions and now it may be it's time

1706
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,280
just to talk a little bit about what

1707
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,039
that might actually mean

1708
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,240
in a practical sense so

1709
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,920
the title of the slide is practical

1710
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,839
indications but up down at the bottom i

1711
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,240
have

1712
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,880
also known as how do you solve problems

1713
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,640
because the two are the same thing like

1714
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,680
this is the question

1715
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,799
how do you how do we solve how do we how

1716
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,240
do we

1717
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,359
um how do we how do we solve problems

1718
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,920
how do we focus on

1719
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,839
uh if we're good at problem solving if

1720
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,680
we're good at solving problems how do we

1721
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,880
do it

1722
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,000
and uh obviously we want if we're going

1723
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,680
to build new societal systems we want to

1724
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,520
build societal systems that help us

1725
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,440
that facilitate our problem-solving

1726
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,920
capacity facilitate our capacity to

1727
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,720
reduce

1728
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,039
uncertainty expected uncertainty right

1729
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,240
so i'm just going to list

1730
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,240
some things and maybe on the first you

1731
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,000
know in the first read of this

1732
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
just you can we can just acknowledge

1733
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,440
like okay yeah that's how we solve

1734
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,319
problems we

1735
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,240
number one there we get we gather data

1736
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,599
we we

1737
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,319
we sense our world you know obviously

1738
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,520
right

1739
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,599
that's how an organism solves a problem

1740
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,119
and even knows that there's a problem to

1741
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,640
solve for that matter

1742
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,559
and we remember we remember what we did

1743
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,559
maybe last week or last year we remember

1744
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:07,920
how we solved something before we

1745
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,520
remember that this situation is

1746
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,400
dangerous

1747
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,920
and we might want to avoid it in the

1748
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
future so we remember remember

1749
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,039
we anticipate or make forecasts and obvi

1750
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:17,359
and

1751
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,400
we've already talked about the

1752
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,559
importance of anticipation forever for

1753
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,640
cognition in any organism

1754
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,880
and and cooperate we cooperate with

1755
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,240
those around us we

1756
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,480
we have a problem to solve and we get

1757
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,520
some help maybe

1758
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,079
we solve it together we we work together

1759
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,920
we build a house together we

1760
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,799
we you know build a jumbo chat together

1761
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,559
we do all these things together we

1762
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,599
farm together but what's

1763
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,720
uh so cooperation is one way to solve a

1764
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,760
problem and then

1765
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,839
what does cooperation entail well it

1766
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,520
requires that we

1767
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,640
maybe we as a group we reward

1768
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,960
uh pro-social or cooperative behavior

1769
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,559
and maybe penalize

1770
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,039
anti-social behavior you know i mean

1771
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,319
that's

1772
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,680
in game theory they've done all these

1773
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,039
studies about cooperation and it's

1774
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:03,520
pretty

1775
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,520
you know there's some really good ideas

1776
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,760
pretty clear ideas basic ideas of

1777
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,520
when do when how do you actually

1778
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,440
facilitate cooperation

1779
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,000
and and what makes cooperation go down

1780
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,720
the toilet

1781
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,400
right so uh if your communication

1782
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,640
really helps cooperation rewarding uh

1783
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,720
pro-social behavior

1784
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,680
transparency helps cooperation fairness

1785
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,319
helps coop

1786
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,000
like all these we know all these things

1787
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,079
right from from common experiences in

1788
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:30,480
life

1789
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,799
and also from studies in game theory in

1790
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,559
other fields

1791
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,599
so uh so solve a problem we cooperate we

1792
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,799
communicate we

1793
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,400
we direct attention there's that word

1794
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,839
attention again we direct our attention

1795
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:45,119
to those things that matter

1796
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,319
we learn from our actions and

1797
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,880
observations so we update our models of

1798
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,599
things

1799
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,920
when we realize like oh no i guess the

1800
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,760
world doesn't work that way

1801
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,599
i should i should learn something but

1802
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,119
the world is a little more

1803
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,319
it works differently than i was

1804
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,240
anticipating or i

1805
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,119
thought before uh and then we act to

1806
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,720
reduce expected uncertainty we

1807
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,160
experiment we

1808
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,280
we we have goal directed activities

1809
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,000
our actions where we you know try to

1810
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that's the exploitation aspect and then

1811
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,119
we also have the exploration aspect

1812
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,599
action for epistemic and again then we

1813
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,280
have this exploration versus

1814
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,720
exploitation trade-off so so i'm not i'm

1815
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,240
just saying what i think everyone

1816
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,760
already understands i'm just making a

1817
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,160
list here but now the question is okay

1818
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,839
fine so that's how we solve problems

1819
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,880
how do each of these play out

1820
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,119
in a societal system setting

1821
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,760
so i you know if i think if we wanted to

1822
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,359
we won't because we don't have time but

1823
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,559
i think if we wanted to

1824
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,400
we could list like 500 ways this this

1825
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,880
any of these play out and it's maybe

1826
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
should play out or could play out

1827
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,359
in a in a healthy society is a society

1828
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,280
that's good at solving problems

1829
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,119
uh i had already mentioned one earlier

1830
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,079
so like let's just say on the topic of

1831
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,720
of anticipation wouldn't it be

1832
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,920
reasonable

1833
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,039
to somehow uh remember

1834
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,520
who remember and pay attention to who is

1835
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,079
good at

1836
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,319
who is good at anticipating the future

1837
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,200
so if

1838
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,319
you know if a certain political figure

1839
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,280
or uh you know a certain organization is

1840
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:23,599
that

1841
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,200
turns out to have a really good track

1842
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,280
record of accurately predicting what's

1843
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,880
going to happen next well then maybe we

1844
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,480
want to pay attention to them

1845
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,599
and pay more attention to them to uh

1846
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,240
than to others who have a terrible track

1847
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,359
record of

1848
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,680
of uh predicting what's going to happen

1849
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,680
next you know like if a politician says

1850
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,319
oh if you

1851
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,559
do this if you do a then b is going to

1852
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,079
happen well if

1853
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,000
you know if by and large those kinds of

1854
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,359
predictions are wrong

1855
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,960
then you know politicians probably not

1856
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,359
worth much

1857
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,920
but but not just in politics obviously

1858
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,480
we may

1859
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,400
we anticipate and like for example

1860
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,520
that's what science does

1861
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,960
science is you know awash with

1862
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,640
trying to figure out how the world works

1863
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,240
and what's going to happen next

1864
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,960
and so so that's another area that we

1865
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,280
could

1866
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,119
you know a healthy society might really

1867
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,200
support the scientific

1868
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,319
uh you know the scientific endeavor

1869
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,559
and pay attention to what scientists are

1870
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,079
saying like for example with climate

1871
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,039
change and

1872
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,160
other things you know if the whole

1873
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,839
scientific world is saying hey this is

1874
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:26,880
serious you've got to pay you've got

1875
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,240
gotta do something about it

1876
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,079
well then maybe a healthy society would

1877
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,039
actually do something about it right

1878
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,079
um honesty the honesty i'm just picking

1879
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,359
out things off the list you know but i

1880
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,720
think we could talk for

1881
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,640
numerous hours about how any of these

1882
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,000
might play out in a

1883
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,839
in a real setting right um honesty so

1884
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,400
uh look at look at the dis look at the

1885
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:48,880
look

1886
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,079
the amount of dishonest uh information

1887
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,559
or manipulated information that is

1888
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,960
flowing around us today in this world

1889
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,000
um you know why is why is that i mean

1890
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
obviously a healthy society would want

1891
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,559
to

1892
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:07,599
share uh honest and valid information

1893
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,599
let's call it quality information you

1894
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,760
know models are good models are built on

1895
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,520
quality information

1896
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,038
so you know

1897
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,399
why here's a question why in our world

1898
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,479
why is there so much just information

1899
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,960
and i would i would suggest that at

1900
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,158
least some of it

1901
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,279
is due to the fact that

1902
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,040
individuals and organizations

1903
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,640
corporations

1904
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,799
are fantastically rewarded

1905
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:43,359
for putting out dishonest

1906
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,158
information right i mean i mean just

1907
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,520
think of a thief i can

1908
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,399
i can call you up in a phone scam and if

1909
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:50,799
i

1910
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:54,479
can convince you that i'm your bank

1911
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,120
and i need your account number then i

1912
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,839
can have

1913
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,399
enormous rewards for being you know

1914
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,560
dastardly dishonest

1915
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,120
you but but it's true i mean maybe

1916
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,719
that's an extreme example but it's true

1917
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,000
in just

1918
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,799
ordinary examples of business and life

1919
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:11,679
that

1920
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,880
one can be rewarded greatly

1921
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,839
or being fairly dishonest or you know

1922
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:18,799
putting out

1923
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,198
something less than quality information

1924
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,000
and then you gotta

1925
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,759
then you gotta ask okay well then if if

1926
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,920
you know like we don't society doesn't

1927
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,279
want to reward

1928
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,399
anti-social anti uh you know

1929
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,439
and anti-transparent anti-honest

1930
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,719
uh behavior how how how would a society

1931
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,399
reward pro-social honest behavior

1932
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,799
transpl how would it maybe a society

1933
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,158
could become more transparent so

1934
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,158
transparency obviously to be a part of

1935
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,120
this

1936
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,960
but but um i'm i'm sort of honing in

1937
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,120
i don't know if you if you can tell but

1938
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,640
i'm sort of honing in just on this

1939
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,199
little

1940
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,719
question about how do we what how do we

1941
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:01,440
reward

1942
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,239
behaviors in this world as a society and

1943
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,600
then that suddenly

1944
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,000
brings up the question of the how does

1945
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,520
an economic system work and

1946
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,719
how does what what how do we

1947
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,520
view money and how do we view income and

1948
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,000
how do we

1949
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,040
use money and income in our lives

1950
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,679
and is there some way that we could

1951
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,120
reinvent

1952
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,239
an economy and reinvent money so

1953
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,120
that it wasn't rewarding uh you know

1954
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,360
reinvent rules and reinvent whatever we

1955
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,080
need to reinvent so that we are actually

1956
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,920
day-to-day moment to moment we're

1957
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,920
rewarding cooperative

1958
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,120
pro-social behavior and and honest

1959
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,400
behavior so like how do we do that

1960
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,880
now i have some ideas on how to do that

1961
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,440
but

1962
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,360
that's in the part three of the paper so

1963
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,280
we'll get to them later

1964
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,960
so i don't want to go much further on

1965
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,360
this but i'm just suggesting that

1966
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,080
that that we could spend you know each

1967
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,120
of these could raise

1968
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,840
a hundred ideas of how to what we could

1969
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,239
do

1970
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,960
in a healthier society to improve our

1971
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,320
capacity for group problem solving

1972
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,600
nice points good for nine

1973
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,719
yeah i always think i am but but hold on

1974
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,000
one second

1975
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,800
on the right hand side of slide eight

1976
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,640
are a few other ideas so

1977
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,560
um uh you know obviously

1978
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,239
we've already talked about fit the

1979
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,480
societal systems measuring the fitness

1980
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,520
of them

1981
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,560
so um you know how do we how do

1982
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,159
that's also a general answer to this

1983
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,840
question of how do we build a society

1984
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,960
that is more fit

1985
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,800
well we actually measure things that are

1986
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,480
important and we score them

1987
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,400
and we share that information widely so

1988
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,760
we know how we're doing

1989
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,480
so we know so we can evaluate either our

1990
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,400
systems or our organizations or our

1991
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,840
institutions or

1992
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,080
society at large or those kinds of

1993
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,080
things so

1994
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,440
metrics are important

1995
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,960
i already mentioned science and critical

1996
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,400
thinking are important so that touches

1997
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,640
on the educational system for example

1998
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,880
the healthy educational system would

1999
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,320
really value

2000
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,080
critical thinking and would train

2001
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,600
individuals to be

2002
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,159
critical thinkers at an early age i

2003
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:12,800
would think

2004
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,120
and then obviously then removing the

2005
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,960
barriers to cooperation

2006
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,400
this society has enormous barriers to

2007
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,199
cooperation

2008
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:24,000
i might want to get it for here's just

2009
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,360
one example out of what could be a

2010
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,400
million examples

2011
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,400
say that i was kind of uh wanted to make

2012
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,679
the world i wanted to

2013
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,320
use my life's energy my work time my 40

2014
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,040
hours a week

2015
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,520
of work a week to make the world a

2016
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,159
better place

2017
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:40,159
so i want to jump in and i want to uh

2018
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,520
i don't know let's say i want to teach

2019
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,800
teach kids little

2020
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,320
children you know maybe i want to be a

2021
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,880
teacher be a good teacher

2022
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,480
well that's great fantastic but

2023
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,199
if i do that i have to pay a financial

2024
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,400
penalty like

2025
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,560
i'm not going to i could become a banker

2026
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,719
instead of suppose those are my two

2027
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,560
choices i could become a banker or a

2028
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,159
finance minute finance person or

2029
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:06,719
something

2030
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,480
or i could become a teacher well i'm

2031
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,159
going to society is going to reward me

2032
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,159
greatly for being a

2033
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,280
banker or a finance person and it's

2034
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,880
going to

2035
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,640
not reward me very well for being a

2036
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,400
teacher

2037
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,960
so i might want to cooperate i might

2038
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,600
want to

2039
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,920
work to for the betterment of humankind

2040
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,640
but

2041
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,320
if i do there's a good chance i'm going

2042
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,239
to be relatively poor

2043
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,760
you know like i pay a heavy price for

2044
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,000
that and that's a that's just a barrier

2045
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,960
to cooperation

2046
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,440
cooperate we should design systems so

2047
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,159
that the

2048
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,040
cooperation becomes the default easy no

2049
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,719
that like the

2050
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,560
do it this way because it's good for

2051
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,480
everyone it's good for you and

2052
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,560
uh sure you want to teach well great we

2053
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,840
have come on in here's

2054
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,360
here's opportunities for you to teach

2055
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,040
and you're not going to pay a penalty

2056
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,800
for becoming a teacher you know you're

2057
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,480
this is going to be easy you can be

2058
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,560
if you want to be a teacher and help

2059
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,159
young children learn better

2060
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,239
great here's wonderful opportunities and

2061
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,679
you're not going to have to

2062
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,920
pay a penalty for doing that we're going

2063
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,880
to

2064
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,080
actually just the opposite we're going

2065
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,719
to reward you for doing it

2066
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,000
okay now we're done with uh slide nine

2067
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,159
or slide it sounds good to nine

2068
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:21,199
okay so um so i

2069
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,480
the only thing i really want to say

2070
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,040
about this this slide is that this

2071
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,080
the concept of the societal systems as a

2072
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,679
cognitive architecture

2073
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,760
i you know i you know probably somewhere

2074
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,280
in the literature there's something

2075
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
you know talking about that in some

2076
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,560
sense but i it's

2077
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,920
i think maybe i don't know if it's as

2078
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,520
kind of like

2079
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,159
pointed as i'm making it in this series

2080
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:44,880
and there

2081
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,679
and there really is no name for what is

2082
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,880
what is the name

2083
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,920
for the set of societal systems

2084
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,400
that helps the society that facilitates

2085
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,719
societal cognition what is the name of

2086
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,080
that

2087
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,239
and there isn't a name you know it's

2088
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,000
it's not an economic system and it's not

2089
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,360
a governance system because that's just

2090
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,400
those are just some

2091
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,239
systems that are that have their own

2092
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,560
connotations so what is the name of this

2093
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,360
whole set of integrated systems that

2094
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,719
helps as society to think well there is

2095
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,600
no name so i

2096
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,679
i mean i there is no formal name and so

2097
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,800
you can't look at if you're going to

2098
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,320
search in the literature on this topic

2099
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:20,880
there's no

2100
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,440
there's no term to search for and uh so

2101
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,040
i thought maybe it would be useful if i

2102
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,280
try to suggest some terms at least

2103
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,840
and i and i suggest the term uh societal

2104
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,080
cognitive architecture for the general

2105
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,719
the general idea that societal systems

2106
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,239
are a cognitive architecture for society

2107
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,360
but then for the more specific

2108
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,560
developing de novo systems to be good

2109
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,800
at facilitating societal cognition i

2110
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,239
suggest the term sales uh societal

2111
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,080
societal active inference and learning

2112
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,360
systems um

2113
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,199
i mean maybe there's some other better

2114
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,280
trim i don't know but i i

2115
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,400
threw together this one so it's sales

2116
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,360
that i'm interested in developing new

2117
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,080
new

2118
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,920
designs of societal systems that excel

2119
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,280
facilitate uh sell facilitating societal

2120
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,840
cognition

2121
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,520
so uh you know if one of these terms

2122
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,280
catch on maybe then in the future we'll

2123
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,560
be able to if we're interested in the

2124
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,159
topic we can actually do a search on

2125
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:23,120
google and

2126
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,120
we'll find a you know 100 papers or a

2127
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,480
thousand papers on

2128
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,880
some of these topics well just one quick

2129
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,800
on that it points to the need for

2130
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,880
improved cognitive architecture

2131
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,600
such as knowledge management tools that

2132
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,199
help us collaborate and find

2133
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,880
information semantically like

2134
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,360
information is for our experience

2135
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,760
because you're right it is fragmented

2136
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,480
and therefore

2137
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,040
unproductive across truly different

2138
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,800
disciplines and different jargons

2139
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,960
different languages as well unscanned

2140
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,080
documents

2141
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,840
things that are just only on someone's

2142
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,360
uh notepad just

2143
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,560
it's all over the place right and

2144
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,880
and and sometimes a thing doesn't really

2145
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
exist until you name it and then it and

2146
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,360
then it sort of exists for the larger

2147
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,679
it can't exist for the larger society so

2148
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,520
i'm name i'm naming this

2149
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,840
because maybe if we name it we can talk

2150
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
about it you know

2151
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,400
yes the other the other problem there is

2152
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,080
like when i go to expl it would be much

2153
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,960
easier for me

2154
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,719
to just throw out a term like cognitive

2155
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,320
social cognitive

2156
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
societal architecture and if people

2157
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,520
understood that term then i wouldn't

2158
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,199
have to spend a half hour

2159
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,280
trying to explain what it is that i'm

2160
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,719
talking about right so

2161
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,360
terms terms can help if we have a shared

2162
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,280
understanding of what their meaning is

2163
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,840
what what is not sales because it's a

2164
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,440
you know what is what's not part of the

2165
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,120
function of the body

2166
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,360
how do we differentiate what is apart

2167
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,600
from that instead of this just being

2168
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,719
the one-to-one rapper around economics

2169
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,199
governance legal et cetera et cetera

2170
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,199
right right right good point and uh i

2171
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,040
don't i really might

2172
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,360
my use of the term sales i'm suggesting

2173
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,480
it for use

2174
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,679
really in this de novo design you know

2175
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:02,320
process

2176
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,520
of of creating new systems so

2177
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,960
um quite true the the the the

2178
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,000
you know the cognitive the concepts of

2179
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,080
cognition that we've been talking about

2180
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,440
they are universal so uh

2181
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,520
it is true but we're kind of kind of

2182
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,520
focusing on just

2183
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,120
sales as a term for the kind of r

2184
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,080
d project r d projects to move forward

2185
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,120
that might

2186
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,679
uh look at the de novo designs of new

2187
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,320
systems

2188
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,120
right just the pond traveling sales

2189
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,440
person

2190
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,040
it's a problem you know it's a hard

2191
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,600
problem actually

2192
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,040
it's traveling salesperson problem

2193
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,600
yes it is

2194
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,080
all right so with that uh we are

2195
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,120
uh uh ready to move on to uh

2196
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,480
the actual talk cool today

2197
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,560
drum rolls please drum roll schedule the

2198
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,760
time

2199
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,920
awesome the second is the second part

2200
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,520
you know this is um a different

2201
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,760
media we're kind of spilling above and

2202
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,760
beyond what you've wrote in the papers

2203
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,840
because the three papers are the version

2204
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,719
of reference

2205
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,080
that's where people will cite but

2206
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,840
actually in this increasingly

2207
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,120
digitized insightable world perhaps the

2208
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,320
things that you're

2209
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,800
sharing with us as well as even the

2210
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,880
anonymous content that people produce on

2211
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,480
a jam board or live chat like this all

2212
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,159
becomes part of how we

2213
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,800
produce our uncertainty and act yeah

2214
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,360
yeah

2215
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,880
and and hopefully becomes part of the

2216
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,120
record and part of the useful record for

2217
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,280
for moving forward on some of these

2218
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,960
concepts

2219
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,040
okay so part one was all about world

2220
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,640
view it was

2221
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,640
you know high level discussions high

2222
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,560
level topics about

2223
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,880
what creates a world view and how what

2224
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,640
kind of world view would be useful in

2225
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,520
the setting for

2226
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,199
developing new systems and then now

2227
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,880
we're moving on to the more nuts and

2228
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,440
bolts of things a little bit more

2229
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,400
in the sense of why are we even

2230
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,440
motivated to

2231
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,199
to transform and uh and

2232
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:11,600
if we do want to develop new systems

2233
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,239
uh what kind of strategy you know what

2234
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:14,530
like

2235
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,159
[Music]

2236
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,239
it's it's not enough just to come up

2237
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,760
with some great design

2238
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,840
it has to be viable in the sense that it

2239
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,440
can be implemented there has to be some

2240
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,719
way to actually

2241
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,679
use these ideas actually live these

2242
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:28,960
ideas

2243
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,199
um and if there's not then we're sort of

2244
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,080
wasting our time

2245
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,320
so strategy is core to the whole

2246
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,440
proposed r d program

2247
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,880
right um so

2248
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,360
yeah so i'm going to in in part two i

2249
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,480
talk about really

2250
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,679
uh i try to argue a given narrative in

2251
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,280
part two that i try to argue that

2252
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,040
transformation is prudent

2253
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,600
given the risks we face attractive given

2254
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,040
its potential benefits

2255
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,360
and achievable given the current

2256
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,040
political financial

2257
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,880
and social constraints so that's what i

2258
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,040
hope to accomplish in this paper

2259
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,639
and that's what i hope to accomplish in

2260
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,199
this this talk too

2261
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,360
cool all right so on the question of

2262
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,480
motivation like why transform

2263
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,639
we we touched on some of these ideas in

2264
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,480
our first talk

2265
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,960
but i i would just like to point out

2266
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,840
that we face

2267
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,199
a host of extremely difficult problems

2268
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,400
climate change being one of them

2269
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,480
climate change biodiversity laws

2270
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,080
groundwater depletion

2271
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,280
soils depletion

2272
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,880
poverty financial

2273
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,080
uh uncertainty uh

2274
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,239
you know in that sense debt might play

2275
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,600
into that role

2276
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,760
um you know if you make a list of all

2277
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,159
the

2278
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,239
very serious problems that humanity

2279
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,239
faces it's kind of a long list

2280
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,320
migration and then one problem causes

2281
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,360
another so

2282
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:03,280
climate change is certainly likely

2283
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,520
almost certainly will increase the

2284
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,440
number of refugees trying to cross

2285
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,000
borders people living without homes that

2286
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,960
are fleeing

2287
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,639
areas that are not that don't have

2288
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,719
enough water or are not livable

2289
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,000
or you know things like that so one

2290
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,280
problem causes the other

2291
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,280
and you know what what what everyone is

2292
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,600
fearful of happening is is that

2293
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,040
you have this the collection of 10 or 20

2294
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,199
really serious problems and then

2295
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,280
something happens to flare one of them

2296
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:31,840
up

2297
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,719
and then suddenly that problem you know

2298
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,360
transfers to other problems and then

2299
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,920
you have uh just one you know like

2300
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,199
everything's connected so

2301
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,159
if one part of our global society gives

2302
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,440
sway

2303
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,760
it could be that everything starts to

2304
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,520
kind of fall apart

2305
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,560
so there is a fear of that and there is

2306
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,159
a need to address these

2307
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,360
problems independently and then also

2308
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,400
in a holistic sense and i would like to

2309
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,520
emphasize that these problems we face

2310
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,159
are in a sense symptoms not really

2311
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,159
problems in and of themselves they're

2312
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:08,960
symptoms

2313
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,880
of a failure of society

2314
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,280
up you know to today a failure to

2315
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,639
address the needs

2316
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,679
of of the society a failure to reduce

2317
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,520
uncertainty and failure to do exactly

2318
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,120
what we were talking about

2319
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,520
in the previous part of this talk right

2320
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,400
so so

2321
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,080
climate change climate change is because

2322
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,840
we failed to take action we've known

2323
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,320
about climate change for

2324
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,320
60 years i don't know i mean like it's

2325
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,080
it's been in the it's been

2326
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,760
it's been um uh in the scientific world

2327
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,560
like in a

2328
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,840
in a major way uh with major agreement

2329
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,800
on the

2330
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,679
implications and the basic processes and

2331
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,320
the

2332
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,320
and what it means to society that's been

2333
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,360
talked about

2334
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,800
that there was you know

2335
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,760
the scientific world was on this 30

2336
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,520
years ago

2337
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,520
and talking about it and writing papers

2338
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,600
and having you know so

2339
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,600
so we didn't society didn't listen

2340
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,120
and it didn't and i would say it didn't

2341
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,800
listen for a reason because

2342
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,239
if it had listened to those warnings it

2343
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,760
society would have had to have changed

2344
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,360
and there are elements of society

2345
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,719
that are doing well

2346
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,040
and are maybe not so interested in

2347
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,880
changing behaviors and

2348
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,080
especially changing power distributions

2349
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,600
right so uh the people that the

2350
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,560
power the powers that more or less guide

2351
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,440
society

2352
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,040
we're not interested in dealing with

2353
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,159
our serious problems because we have

2354
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,280
they have gotten worse

2355
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,480
over the last 50 years or whatever

2356
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
these problems have amplified if you

2357
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,719
don't solve a problem it tends to fester

2358
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,960
and get larger that's exactly what's

2359
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,960
happened now we're at

2360
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,080
the period of not only

2361
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,080
not only will climate change you know is

2362
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,679
climate change going to

2363
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,719
affect the gdp that's that's that's

2364
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,159
uh yes it's the real problem is

2365
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,000
are we going to go extinct i mean this

2366
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,199
is serious

2367
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,120
this is you know like this is life and

2368
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,440
death now for

2369
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,080
if not if not millions or billions of

2370
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,679
people it's life and death for our

2371
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:24,639
species

2372
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,120
we have to deal with this in some kind

2373
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,000
of bold

2374
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,800
way or we we won't have children on this

2375
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,679
planet

2376
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,560
and you know whatever in uh 50 years 100

2377
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,320
years 200 years

2378
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,600
humans won't be a thing so that's how

2379
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,239
i say that because uh that's how badly

2380
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,600
society has failed us we are at the

2381
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,280
brink of falling off a cliff

2382
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,080
we maybe we're already maybe we already

2383
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,600
fell off a cliff and we just

2384
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,880
don't quite realize it yet

2385
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,639
like what what kind of healthy organism

2386
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,480
puts itself in commits suicide like what

2387
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,480
healthy system commits suicide

2388
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,760
none really only the phoenix

2389
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,320
yeah only the phoenix yeah and you know

2390
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,920
that maybe it worked out for that one

2391
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,639
okay it

2392
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,920
sort of it rose i guess but uh and maybe

2393
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,040
we'll do the same but

2394
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,080
uh you know my point is is that

2395
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,520
the serious problems we face are all

2396
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,159
symptoms of our lack of cognitive

2397
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,520
capacity at the societal level

2398
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,679
and there were there have been there are

2399
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,360
there have been solutions to all these

2400
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,000
problems

2401
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,360
for decades and we simply have

2402
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,000
not taken them because because doing so

2403
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
would have disrupted

2404
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,239
i think the distribution of power in

2405
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,760
society and

2406
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,760
that just people weren't willing to do

2407
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,679
that

2408
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:56,800
okay so um so in this paper

2409
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,480
on this call for transformational change

2410
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,239
so i am i'm trying

2411
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,960
to i'm calling for transformational

2412
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,000
change right now but

2413
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,040
i'm not alone so this this idea of we

2414
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,960
need bold change this is not just me

2415
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,280
in a vacuum this is uh most of the

2416
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,960
scientific world really

2417
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,679
and uh most of the global policy making

2418
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:16,080
world

2419
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,679
and a large section of the global public

2420
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,320
is all realizing that we are in deep

2421
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,159
trouble and we need to change

2422
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:27,760
not incrementally not slowly but rapidly

2423
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,880
and deeply and across every aspect of

2424
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,080
society so i'll just use the words

2425
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,560
this is a from the 2019 global

2426
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,440
assessment

2427
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,480
from the ipbes

2428
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:47,360
the un uh they as they in their words

2429
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,400
uh current and national they say current

2430
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,840
national global programs are

2431
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,080
insufficient to avoid you know

2432
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,360
catastrophe

2433
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:59,280
and they call for a transformational

2434
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,239
change they use the word

2435
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,360
transformational

2436
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,000
and they define it as a fundamental

2437
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,679
system-wide reorganization

2438
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,560
across technical technological economic

2439
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,760
social factors

2440
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,159
including paradigms goals and values i

2441
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:12,840
mean

2442
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,000
essentially uh

2443
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,440
you know enormous fundamental change in

2444
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,159
how we

2445
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,159
understand ourselves how we understand

2446
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,560
the world how we behave what we do for a

2447
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,280
living

2448
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,400
how industry works how consumerism works

2449
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,040
what products we make how we recycle

2450
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,679
like

2451
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,159
how much energy we use how where we get

2452
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:35,280
our energy

2453
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,960
so so um i think maybe i don't know i

2454
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,000
don't want to put words in the

2455
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,520
human's mouth but i think maybe they

2456
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,480
were really still kind of talking about

2457
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,000
um you know like improving

2458
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,920
current systems you know like we can

2459
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,080
improve our economic system

2460
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,480
to do this we can improve our we can

2461
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,239
take bold steps within our governance

2462
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,000
systems we can take bold steps

2463
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,760
within our economic systems financial

2464
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,520
systems we can do better there's ways

2465
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,040
that we can do better

2466
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,199
i would like to very much agree with

2467
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,280
that there are ways we can do better we

2468
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:07,760
should

2469
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,679
we should i would i would put that under

2470
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,520
the category of reform

2471
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,280
we should do everything in our power to

2472
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,679
reform the existing systems

2473
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,360
because that is the quickest bang for

2474
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,920
the buck i mean we can do more

2475
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,040
isn't it imperative that we act

2476
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,960
and put our energies behind reforming

2477
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,960
as best we can the existing systems

2478
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,880
working within existing systems

2479
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,400
and reforming them so they can do a

2480
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,080
better job is so that

2481
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,560
we can reach some kind of transformation

2482
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,560
even within existing systems

2483
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,120
but but this uh this proposed r d

2484
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
program and my interests

2485
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,920
are are beyond that so i'm not i i'm not

2486
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,960
you know my interest here is

2487
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,159
uh not in reform not in improving

2488
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,639
capitalism for example or or

2489
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,040
representative democracy it is in

2490
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,840
building de novo systems from the ground

2491
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,400
up that

2492
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,639
are fit for purpose as as we've been

2493
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,480
talking about

2494
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:08,080
so you know i that's what i mean when i

2495
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:08,480
say

2496
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,960
societal transformation i mean i mean

2497
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,159
shifting to

2498
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,880
building testing and shifting to new

2499
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:15,760
systems

2500
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,080
and in the you know we're familiar with

2501
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,120
these kind of concepts

2502
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,000
when we download software and in the

2503
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,760
software world

2504
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,880
there the terms are usually updates so

2505
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,280
like

2506
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,800
you know i'm going to update my software

2507
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,880
minor improvement i'm going to upgrade

2508
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,639
my software to a new version i'm going

2509
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,159
to get you know version four instead of

2510
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,000
version three so that's kind of like

2511
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,280
big reform i'm gonna get an upgrade

2512
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,960
then migration so i'm gonna do i don't

2513
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,320
even like this

2514
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,320
this company or this product i'm gonna

2515
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,239
switch to open source

2516
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,320
and i'm gonna use the linux operating

2517
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,520
system or some other

2518
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,639
i'm going to do something else i'm going

2519
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,320
to use some entirely new system because

2520
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,600
the old one really doesn't work very

2521
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,320
well

2522
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,120
so so my focus is on this the you know

2523
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,239
is a migration

2524
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:02,719
the the testing development uh uh

2525
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,520
and uh implementation of de novo

2526
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,400
designed

2527
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,840
societal systems um

2528
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,560
okay so i think uh you know and and a

2529
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,920
science driven

2530
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,239
this in a science-driven process so

2531
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,880
that's important to add to

2532
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,719
okay so lots of people calling for

2533
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,239
transformational change and that's what

2534
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:22,560
this

2535
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,560
paper is about transformation understood

2536
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,239
as migration

2537
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,440
to new systems um

2538
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,880
on slide 12 uh

2539
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,199
i think maybe i mean others might

2540
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,880
disagree but i think maybe this is the

2541
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,960
first series in the literature that

2542
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,719
uh in the science literature that really

2543
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,800
lays out a r d program that aims to

2544
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,560
tackle this de novo design of new

2545
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,520
systems

2546
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,920
um i don't i've not seen any others that

2547
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:48,719
are that are

2548
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,360
kind of comparable so i think we're

2549
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,880
maybe

2550
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,360
you know paving new ground here perhaps

2551
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,880
at least i hope

2552
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,719
uh i want to emphasize something we

2553
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,239
talked about on the in the last talk

2554
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,199
that this is uh

2555
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:04,960
we're talking about second order

2556
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,040
sciences as opposed to

2557
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,440
first order science so first order

2558
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,960
science again is

2559
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
what we normally think of as science as

2560
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,040
someone is doing experiments they're

2561
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:15,760
they're

2562
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,679
detached from the experiment the

2563
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,679
scientists are detached they're just

2564
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,120
they set it up they let the experiment

2565
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,360
run they they don't interfere

2566
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,840
they they just record what happened and

2567
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,120
hopefully they gain some knowledge from

2568
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,239
doing so

2569
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,560
fantastic stuff most of science is all

2570
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,400
this is first order science is one

2571
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,960
is wonderful but for these kinds of

2572
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,560
problems for this kind of

2573
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,880
problem that we're facing this global

2574
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,600
climate

2575
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,280
global crisis problem this i think

2576
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,400
uh requires what is called

2577
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,800
second order science and there's a in my

2578
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,840
series i

2579
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,960
i cite the work by phase you know on

2580
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,639
this topic and that's a this great

2581
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:55,360
article i

2582
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,880
i recommend that to everyone that it's

2583
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,440
in the paper so you can get it there but

2584
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,800
he describes what

2585
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,960
they i should say today it's a long list

2586
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,960
of authors describe what they mean by

2587
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,600
a second-order science and why it's

2588
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,560
important

2589
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,600
and uh they just kind of in a nutshell

2590
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,400
we're talking about in our case building

2591
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,080
new systems we're talking about

2592
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,679
kind of a metal learning so we're

2593
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,600
learning to learn we're

2594
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,280
we're learning to build new systems that

2595
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,920
help us to learn and build new systems

2596
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,080
right we want to excel

2597
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,840
at learning that's the whole concept of

2598
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,880
this we we want a society that excels at

2599
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,480
learning and problem solving

2600
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,199
and adaptation and we're and we're in

2601
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,800
the process of learning

2602
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,199
to build new systems that produce this

2603
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,280
effect so it's kind of a meta learning

2604
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,760
science uh meta learning process and

2605
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,480
and just in general the second order

2606
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,199
science is

2607
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,199
the focus is on process the effort is

2608
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,320
value driven

2609
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,239
and the part and the scientists are

2610
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,159
participants along with stakeholders who

2611
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,120
together

2612
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,199
learn develop and evaluate solutions

2613
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,159
together so

2614
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:07,600
it's quite different from first order

2615
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,920
science and it's exactly the kind of

2616
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,760
science i think that is necessary for

2617
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,880
this larger

2618
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,400
meta learning project

2619
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,239
in the in the paper i i i i talk about

2620
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,560
six overarching systems i just want to

2621
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,239
say that that's what we're focused on

2622
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:24,719
here

2623
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,360
so economic uh their economic governance

2624
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,159
legal health

2625
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,159
analytical and educational systems those

2626
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,080
are the ones i've chosen to focus on

2627
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,679
and each of them can be split down

2628
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:36,000
further like in in my terminology the

2629
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,080
economic system also includes a monetary

2630
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,920
system and a financial system

2631
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,199
and so on and each of these can be split

2632
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,239
down

2633
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,480
further so that's what we're doing we're

2634
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,000
like trying to

2635
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,840
develop designs for each of these that

2636
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,360
are integrated not not

2637
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,119
just hey let's just build a new economic

2638
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,400
system and leave everything else and

2639
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,920
change we'll do the economic system

2640
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,480
first

2641
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,560
that's not the that's not the point of

2642
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,159
the process the idea is

2643
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:03,199
how can we build a integrated set

2644
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,040
of systems of full cognitive

2645
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,360
architecture that helps us to

2646
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,679
achieve these goals and it's really a

2647
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,000
nice dovetailing with development

2648
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,040
is what organisms do that's embryonic

2649
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,199
development or colony level development

2650
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,679
or the niche being modified so it's like

2651
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:20,960
research and development

2652
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,239
research information foraging um

2653
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,600
whatever we want to think about

2654
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,119
information foraging to mean here with

2655
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,639
research or just search but

2656
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,119
it's like we already have design latency

2657
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:31,840
within

2658
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,080
potentially even the structures we have

2659
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,360
so how are we going to pull out of the

2660
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,320
tailspin

2661
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,800
if that's what we're in to build towards

2662
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,960
developing a healthier trajectory

2663
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,560
that's right we're in the process of

2664
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,640
evolution you know

2665
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,840
[Music]

2666
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,000
and and every organism is evolving

2667
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,119
exactly as you say

2668
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,280
and and developing so we're just being a

2669
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,119
part of that

2670
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:56,560
uh and in a you know

2671
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,480
quite a quite a sensible part of that i

2672
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,080
might add too it's kind of like

2673
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,239
oh we're faced with severe problems that

2674
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,360
we might uh

2675
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,199
have a masked eye off of humans or go

2676
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,199
extinct but because of so

2677
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,360
let me think what would be a good idea

2678
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,719
oh let's do

2679
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:11,679
let's think about doing things

2680
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,199
differently let's try to build a

2681
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,239
different way to

2682
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,400
live our lives you know that's just kind

2683
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,600
of like duh

2684
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,440
that's a good idea let's let's find a

2685
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,119
better way to live our lives and be more

2686
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,199
cooperative and have a healthier world

2687
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,639
that's an excellent idea um

2688
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,199
okay so uh in this is kind of a warm-up

2689
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,080
to what's coming

2690
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,639
in the paper i i speak a lot about local

2691
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:33,360
community

2692
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,199
and i just want to emphasize or i want

2693
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:36,960
to explain what that means a little bit

2694
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,639
so um uh for one thing i i call

2695
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,679
society a organism or a superorganism

2696
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,960
and a cognitive organism with that and

2697
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,159
uh and by society i mean really a

2698
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,800
society of any size so in particular

2699
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,600
i'm interested in local communities for

2700
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,159
some reasons it'll become clear shortly

2701
01:36:58,159 --> 01:36:59,840
so a local community might be just like

2702
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,679
a fraction of a city not even a full

2703
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,679
city and not even a political body not a

2704
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:05,679
like a formal political body but a

2705
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,119
group of people who in particular have

2706
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,880
in this case are particularly interested

2707
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,239
in uh

2708
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:15,280
participating in trying out and field

2709
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:15,760
testing

2710
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,000
and using some of these new systems that

2711
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,360
we're talking about developing

2712
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,560
so uh you know let's say uh

2713
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,760
when i say a local community let's say

2714
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,719
a group of a thousand people or more

2715
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:29,280
could be

2716
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,360
could be larger but not not necessarily

2717
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,839
even a city and certainly not a nation

2718
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,400
okay so um so i said that the u.n and

2719
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,840
others are this is slide

2720
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,800
13. i've said that you the u.n and

2721
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,480
others are

2722
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,880
come out with strong language uh calling

2723
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,920
for a

2724
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,320
transformational change which i think

2725
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,280
again

2726
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,119
you know for many uh folks involved

2727
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,639
there i think maybe their idea

2728
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,840
really is more what i would call reform

2729
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,719
again very very important but it might

2730
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,639
help here to talk about why

2731
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,040
why reform might not be enough like why

2732
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,199
why you know if the fee win and other

2733
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,320
agencies and

2734
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,000
other groups are really are really

2735
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,760
putting up some great proposals for

2736
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,360
reform and improvement of existing

2737
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,080
systems

2738
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,159
you know why am i interested in in

2739
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,760
developing new systems why don't we just

2740
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,040
do reform you know

2741
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,880
if that'll do the trick let's why why

2742
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,880
bother with more

2743
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,960
and there's numerous reasons that i lay

2744
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,080
out in the in the

2745
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,639
paper number two of why i think

2746
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,080
transformation

2747
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,920
new system development is is necessary

2748
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,159
and uh uh you know to start with

2749
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:43,280
and as we've kind of been saying here i

2750
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,000
you can look look at the world and the

2751
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,520
problems that we face with climate

2752
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,159
change and biodiversity loss and others

2753
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:53,840
and you can suspect that current systems

2754
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,159
are

2755
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:57,280
incapable maybe incapable of preventing

2756
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,080
widespread

2757
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,199
catastrophe and securing our continued

2758
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,560
vitality

2759
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,800
i mean really the you know the the

2760
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,239
report card doesn't look good

2761
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,159
for existing systems they've done a

2762
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,159
rather crappy job of protecting the

2763
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,320
human health in the environment to the

2764
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,080
to the extent that we now face

2765
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,880
perhaps in our lifetime or soon after

2766
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,320
perhaps a

2767
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,639
mass die off of humans or even

2768
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,280
extinction of humans

2769
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,840
so you know why why would we think that

2770
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,119
they're capable now

2771
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,639
suddenly of of of acting differently

2772
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,000
you know excellent to do reform i don't

2773
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,840
want to talk anyone out of the reform

2774
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,280
efforts because they're absolutely

2775
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,480
important but i am suggesting that maybe

2776
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,679
we should have a plan b

2777
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,280
in case plan a doesn't work out so well

2778
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,920
so uh uh you know transformation this is

2779
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,320
a

2780
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,600
this is a plan b in a sense and in the

2781
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,159
end

2782
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,840
might turn out to be better than plan a

2783
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
even if reform is useful

2784
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,400
and and helpful plan b might turn out to

2785
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,360
be the better bet

2786
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,520
so you can kind of catch it on both ends

2787
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,960
there

2788
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,880
so i just talked about a few things i

2789
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,199
mentioned in the paper of why

2790
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:11,040
you know like why why why

2791
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,040
evidence of current systems being

2792
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,480
incapable of preventing

2793
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,639
a widespread catastrophe so one is the

2794
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:17,920
paris agreement

2795
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,600
and then this is quoting from one of the

2796
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,960
un studies i believe

2797
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,239
uh it says ambitions are broadly

2798
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,560
consistent with cost-effective pathways

2799
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,400
that result in a global warming of about

2800
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,080
three degrees by 2100

2801
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,880
with warming continuing afterwards okay

2802
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,159
so

2803
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,280
so you know in a practical sense you

2804
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,320
know if the

2805
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,159
paris agreement were interactive that's

2806
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,520
sort of what

2807
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,880
uh where it would lead to it is clearly

2808
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,360
it is

2809
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,639
you know is maybe an important agreement

2810
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:51,600
but uh not enough not nearly enough it

2811
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,719
looks like

2812
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:55,760
and uh if indeed we were to reach about

2813
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,760
three degrees centigrade change

2814
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,040
from um historical levels uh

2815
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,440
that is that's already in the iffy

2816
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,080
category

2817
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,040
of like you know how do humans what do

2818
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,880
we do we even have a civilization if we

2819
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,159
reach their degrees you know it's an

2820
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:12,080
iffy question maybe we do maybe we find

2821
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,679
a way to deal with it

2822
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,760
and get by or maybe we don't maybe

2823
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,560
that's already way too much

2824
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,760
um and uh also the reform efforts uh

2825
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,040
don't adequately address certain

2826
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,040
structural uh problems

2827
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,840
that we that we face like most reform

2828
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,639
efforts

2829
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,760
are not really looking at the extreme

2830
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,159
income and income and wealth divisions

2831
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:35,360
in the world

2832
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,719
uh you know the most of the most of the

2833
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,320
reform efforts are not

2834
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,480
looking at how we can not have

2835
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,239
billionaires but rather

2836
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,800
have everyone more or less equally

2837
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,920
engaged in

2838
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,719
the you know economic sphere and in a

2839
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:51,600
sense having

2840
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,000
economic power to make decisions in this

2841
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,760
world

2842
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,119
so so even if reform efforts are useful

2843
01:41:59,119 --> 01:41:59,679
and good

2844
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,159
i hope they are uh maybe they won't be

2845
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,080
enough and maybe they won't even

2846
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,480
touch deeply on some topics that really

2847
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,280
need to be

2848
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,800
addressed um so i argue

2849
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,239
you know this this section covers

2850
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,080
several pages but in the end i argue

2851
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,360
that even if

2852
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,800
even if reform efforts are are useful

2853
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,280
and helpful uh and they're successful

2854
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,719
and you know for what they're

2855
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,800
shooting for they're still likely to

2856
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,400
leave societies hampered in their

2857
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,320
in their capacity to learn and adapt

2858
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
with many unsolved problems to address

2859
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,239
like even for example even right now

2860
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:35,360
even at one

2861
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,159
what we're at i'm not sure what degree

2862
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,360
we're at right now

2863
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,159
over historical levels but still below

2864
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,040
two degrees

2865
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:47,199
maybe we're 1.3 i don't know what it is

2866
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:50,159
already there's nations that are you

2867
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,239
know they're the island nations that are

2868
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,199
not able to handle this you know like

2869
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,880
people are already started i have to

2870
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,920
relocate

2871
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,239
and every indication is that that's just

2872
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,080
going to become worse and worse

2873
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,360
so uh even if we even if we keep the

2874
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,760
keep it below 1.5 degrees or we keep it

2875
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,000
below 2 degrees the warming

2876
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,239
we're going to have severe problems

2877
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,600
social problems

2878
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,560
economic problems environmental problems

2879
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,400
ecological problems and somehow we're

2880
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,920
going to have to deal with this

2881
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,679
harsher world than even harsher than

2882
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:24,320
today

2883
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,080
you know more dangerous than today and

2884
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,480
more strained than today more stressful

2885
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,360
than today and i'm suggesting that the

2886
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,520
best way to deal with a future world

2887
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,280
that is stressful and uncertain highly

2888
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,960
uncertain and difficult

2889
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,119
is to become really good at problem

2890
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,320
solving

2891
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,080
isn't i mean that's how you would go

2892
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,520
about it that's you would be

2893
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,080
if you can you would become really good

2894
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:46,800
at acting

2895
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,800
in an uncertain world and making wise

2896
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,320
decisions so that

2897
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,239
you don't have to suffer any more than

2898
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,480
is necessary

2899
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,840
um uh yeah

2900
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
so that's that's you know like there

2901
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,480
would be even even if we even if reform

2902
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,840
is successful

2903
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,400
it would still be useful to develop to

2904
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,880
become

2905
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,920
better at problem solving um and i think

2906
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,480
that

2907
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,400
there's great opportunity to become

2908
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,840
better i mean as

2909
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,159
as a whole society hasn't even really

2910
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:17,360
tried to become

2911
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,760
a good problem solver like you know in a

2912
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,639
focused

2913
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,920
science driven way we've never really

2914
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,960
put our mind to this

2915
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,119
and we can put our mind to it and i

2916
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,000
think that would be

2917
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,600
tremendous improvements that we could

2918
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,360
make that's

2919
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,119
you know that's why i wrote the series

2920
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,719
is because i think we could do so much

2921
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:35,360
better

2922
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,159
than we're doing today which is not very

2923
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,920
well

2924
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:45,199
um let's see anything else on this slide

2925
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,480
yes down in the lower right hand corner

2926
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,520
i have a

2927
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,320
kind of a long list of things that we

2928
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,199
need to do and

2929
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,440
i won't read it now but you know we

2930
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,960
basically have to remake

2931
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,360
everything from what we make how we make

2932
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,199
it how we use it where it goes how it's

2933
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,239
disposed of

2934
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,239
how we treat each other how we cooperate

2935
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,320
who we cooperate i mean just like

2936
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:11,679
deep transformation from across

2937
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:14,159
every aspect of human life and in human

2938
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:15,440
social life

2939
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,440
so uh you know it to me at least it's

2940
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,560
inconceivable

2941
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,800
that existing systems could even come

2942
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:23,920
close to the

2943
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,560
level of transformation that is actually

2944
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,360
not only

2945
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,480
needed but would be beneficial

2946
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,800
like it would be really beneficial if

2947
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,920
societies became

2948
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,040
good at problem solving and adaptation

2949
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,600
and it's pretty much inconceivable to

2950
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,000
inconceivable to me at least that

2951
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,719
existing systems and existing reform

2952
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,239
proposals and efforts

2953
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,800
could come close to what is actually

2954
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,920
needed and

2955
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,960
and would be beneficial

2956
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,639
i think uh you know this is really

2957
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,119
great i'm just looking for a natural

2958
01:45:59,119 --> 01:45:59,760
pause

2959
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,560
point for where we would want to be what

2960
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,760
do you think about

2961
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,400
doing 14 going through it taking our

2962
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,199
time

2963
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:10,400
and then this r d program

2964
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,480
being the pickup point for our third

2965
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,080
session i know we're going slow

2966
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,800
you're going on some great boomerangs so

2967
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
it's awesome but let's walk through

2968
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,840
leaving somebody at the end of the

2969
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,000
second discussion what would

2970
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,800
an r d program be that would meet the

2971
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,480
scope and the type of these challenges

2972
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,360
and then

2973
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,880
three is going to be like you want to

2974
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
know what it is go there

2975
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,360
yeah and i think for for listeners

2976
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,960
daniel and i've been talking about

2977
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,639
you know there's a lot of material to

2978
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,080
unpack here so i think we're going to

2979
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:38,480
have

2980
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,520
more than three videos uh but

2981
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,360
we'll figure out what the dates will be

2982
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,719
for them so that we can go through the

2983
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:45,520
whole thing

2984
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,719
uh you know carefully perfect um

2985
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,280
okay so uh we'll we'll end on on slide

2986
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,679
14 then

2987
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,440
uh uh

2988
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,040
maybe to start i would just like to say

2989
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,960
that i've i'm

2990
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,199
the the series is a proposal for you

2991
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,320
know like a like a

2992
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,000
soft proposal for a new r d programming

2993
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,920
to know about development of new systems

2994
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,800
but other people might come up with

2995
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,239
another proposal

2996
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,639
like you know mine maybe is just one of

2997
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,840
many possible ways to go about

2998
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:23,840
the r d program for new proposals

2999
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,679
and i would welcome i would hope even

3000
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,239
that it would be fantastic if there were

3001
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:31,679
you know 20 projects happening around

3002
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:32,239
the world

3003
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,719
of uh aimed at this same thing and that

3004
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,800
we and that each of these projects was

3005
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,560
cooperating with each other so that we

3006
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,920
can learn from each other

3007
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,960
and and move forward you know in the

3008
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,119
most efficient and useful most useful

3009
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,639
way

3010
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,600
so that's one of the reasons that i made

3011
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,239
this

3012
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:54,320
desert list is uh like what would be

3013
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,239
if other if if if there's going to be

3014
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,159
multiple r d programs or even if it's

3015
01:47:58,159 --> 01:47:58,800
just my

3016
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,960
this just this one that i put out you

3017
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,960
know what what would be a good

3018
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,639
what has to be included in the r d

3019
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,000
program you know what which which

3020
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,159
what should be there so that we would

3021
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,440
know that it's a you know

3022
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,679
like a reasonably complete one and so

3023
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:13,600
that we could we could compare r d

3024
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,840
program so if i propose this one and

3025
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,760
someone else proposes another one we can

3026
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,840
compare say on number five

3027
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,159
uh number five develops new integrated

3028
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,960
systems that span all six of these major

3029
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,040
societal systems economic governance et

3030
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,320
cetera well

3031
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,000
if someone else proposes one that it's

3032
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
only focused on economic systems well

3033
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,480
there's a way to just distinguish

3034
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,440
between the two

3035
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,400
r d programs so that's uh that's that's

3036
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,239
part of my purpose here of laying this

3037
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:40,719
out

3038
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,760
and then it's also also the purpose that

3039
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,480
you will see as you read the series that

3040
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,119
i

3041
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,199
talk about each one of these so this is

3042
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:50,320
just in a sense

3043
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,360
it's a it's a index to

3044
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,920
the to the larger series and also one

3045
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:56,960
point um

3046
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,960
is that a scientist might say you need

3047
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,880
to do a b and c to really study you know

3048
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,320
the mosquitoes wing

3049
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,920
and then of course they measure a b and

3050
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,600
c so of course they solve the mosquitoes

3051
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,080
wing

3052
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,320
but actually you're laying out a

3053
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,880
protocol for evaluating policy across

3054
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,320
scales and then

3055
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,400
putting up almost like a retort to

3056
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,080
yourself at least initially

3057
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,080
that you believe could be held against

3058
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,159
this rubric like a report card

3059
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:22,320
and then again where a policy is better

3060
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,239
on point five or eleven or whatever it

3061
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:24,880
be

3062
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,040
we can make that decision in a way or we

3063
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,320
can version the rubric

3064
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,320
so this isn't just setting the target or

3065
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,320
painting the target texas sharpshooter

3066
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,599
paint the target after you wrote the

3067
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,920
paper hypothesizing after the results

3068
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,960
are known harking

3069
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,960
this is like laying out where we do want

3070
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,159
it to go

3071
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:43,040
right exactly exactly and uh and i hope

3072
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,360
that

3073
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,080
uh that we refined it together as a as a

3074
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,760
community refined this list

3075
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:51,280
so that we hone it better even um

3076
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,280
uh maybe there's some things i left out

3077
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,639
or some things i should have said

3078
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,400
or things i said i didn't need to say

3079
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,840
who knows but i'm sure it could be

3080
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,520
improved

3081
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,520
so uh we don't have much time and i

3082
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,280
won't go uh

3083
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,000
i won't go into detail on these but

3084
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,880
maybe i'll just

3085
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,119
uh just to give a flavor i'll just talk

3086
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,159
about a few

3087
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:14,159
scattering here um so obviously

3088
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,679
number one if you if you know you're

3089
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,440
talking about a r d program

3090
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,320
it might help to actually provide some

3091
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,760
information about the scale of the

3092
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,960
intended effect i mean

3093
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,679
are we thinking that this r d program is

3094
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:26,960
going to build uh

3095
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,440
new systems for a uh for one particular

3096
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,320
city

3097
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,960
or for uh for you know for a nation or

3098
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,440
for

3099
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,159
you know like what scale is this whole

3100
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,360
thing going to apply who's going to

3101
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,560
where is it going to go if it's

3102
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,480
successful right what is the scale and

3103
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,000
what are the costs what are the risks

3104
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,599
how much money is this whole thing going

3105
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,679
to take you know and we'll talk about

3106
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:46,320
that

3107
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,880
money we'll talk about in the next next

3108
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,560
talk

3109
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,960
uh based on second order science which i

3110
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,760
mentioned earlier

3111
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,320
already uh number three it has a theory

3112
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,280
of change like

3113
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,159
fine you you you you tested a new system

3114
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:01,760
you built it you get great computer

3115
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,360
simulation models great

3116
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,520
now what do we do with it how would you

3117
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,040
ever take that

3118
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,520
idea and make it real implement it in a

3119
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,560
real

3120
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,880
society somewhere how does it how does

3121
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:13,760
that work

3122
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,400
and and where is the blowback gonna be

3123
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,639
where is the pressure is gonna be

3124
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:21,920
against it what might go wrong so that

3125
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,639
should be in there

3126
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,719
uh theory of change um

3127
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,360
number five it develops integrate i

3128
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,639
claim that it's important that it

3129
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,639
develops integrated systems across

3130
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,440
all six of the major ones because if it

3131
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,400
doesn't

3132
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,320
you know if you if you build a

3133
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,159
governance system independent from an

3134
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,679
economic system and you're still using

3135
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,520
the old economic system it's you're it's

3136
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,800
not going to work very well because

3137
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,000
they're going to be at heads with each

3138
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,119
other

3139
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:55,520
not integrated um uh

3140
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,520
six describes the purpose of a silent

3141
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,800
system what in the world is it supposed

3142
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,400
to do how do we know it even worked what

3143
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:00,880
you know

3144
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,800
what do we measure fitness what what was

3145
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,719
it supposed to accomplish and how can we

3146
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,639
how can we evaluate it on what it did

3147
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,000
accomplish or what it's

3148
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,760
supposed to um uh

3149
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,320
how does cognition played like in this

3150
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,400
whole series as well focused on societal

3151
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,119
cognition

3152
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,560
maybe some other ph maybe some other r d

3153
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,159
program doesn't even use the word

3154
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,679
cognition maybe they have an entirely

3155
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:25,360
different way to think about

3156
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,040
what a society is and how it does and

3157
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,800
what the purpose is so if so

3158
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,920
you know it'd be good to say so uh

3159
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,440
makes the work freely available to the

3160
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,960
public uh so that

3161
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,239
and i didn't we haven't talked about

3162
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,000
this but i i'm the

3163
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,119
the uh it's assumed here that whatever

3164
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:42,880
is developed would be developed in an

3165
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,800
open source way or would be freely

3166
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,320
available to the world this is not a

3167
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,000
proprietary

3168
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,639
project at all

3169
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,360
number eight it develops flexible

3170
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,880
options that the public can choose from

3171
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
well

3172
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,040
if there is no one-size-fits-all

3173
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,400
solution i mean that wouldn't be

3174
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,960
very wise at all societies have to have

3175
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,639
flexibility in how they act how they

3176
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,199
what they implement what they choose

3177
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,159
so hopefully it would be a the program

3178
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:13,119
would develop a smorgasbord of ideas and

3179
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,440
possibilities that could be useful in

3180
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,599
different settings

3181
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:21,360
um number 11 addresses the cultural

3182
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,119
changes what kind of educational changes

3183
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:24,800
for example would be necessary to make

3184
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,040
this work uh there would be substantial

3185
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,840
ones actually

3186
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,760
because you build a new system for one

3187
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,119
thing you would have to

3188
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:33,440
explain or educate people on how the new

3189
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,320
system is even

3190
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,880
goes together and how it works and how

3191
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,320
what how would you know if it's not

3192
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,599
working you know all those kinds of

3193
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:40,800
questions

3194
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,480
um number 12 if new systems are

3195
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,360
implemented in multiple locations

3196
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:50,320
so how do is that information shared

3197
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,280
between them how does that work

3198
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,360
is each independent or are they

3199
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,880
communicating or

3200
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,679
is this all part of a larger plan to

3201
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:00,719
have multiple

3202
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:02,960
tests going on at the same time or are

3203
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,480
those just independent things that come

3204
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,840
and go as they do

3205
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:10,560
uh um uh obviously number 13 develop

3206
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,239
systems that are fair and just and then

3207
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:15,679
you know you could that is reasonable uh

3208
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,719
and uh number 14

3209
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,239
you know what are the expected impacts

3210
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,840
when you do simulations for this new

3211
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:22,560
system

3212
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,320
i was how does it look for energy use

3213
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:26,719
and

3214
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:29,040
waste generation and climate change and

3215
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,719
biodiversity loss how

3216
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,480
you know what are we going to get if we

3217
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,800
um if we build these how is it going to

3218
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,679
go what is

3219
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,119
what is the likely outcome of these

3220
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:40,239
things so that's just a few ideas that

3221
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:42,239
a few topics that would be important to

3222
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,000
address in any r d program and i've

3223
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,840
tried my best to

3224
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,679
address them here and even in just three

3225
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,119
papers you know like some of these are

3226
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,159
addressed in just a few

3227
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:52,000
sentences or a few paragraphs somewhere

3228
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,360
in the papers because

3229
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,800
you know you would really need a book i

3230
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,199
think or a series a series of books to

3231
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:58,239
really do a

3232
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,480
thorough job on all of these well you

3233
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,719
know what i kind of saw almost when you

3234
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:05,360
have this list is like a github or a

3235
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,400
versioned

3236
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,440
open source repository where people can

3237
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,679
fork the rubrics they like they can add

3238
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,840
more challenges they can go into detail

3239
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,119
what do you mean by fair

3240
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,560
what do you mean that they're just well

3241
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,480
those are things that we actually

3242
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,880
in active inference we can get down to

3243
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,000
and that's not to say that we're going

3244
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,840
to be carving out the human it means

3245
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,800
that we're going to be

3246
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,119
designing for ourselves and for

3247
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,639
whoever's on board and just like the

3248
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:29,440
ship makers

3249
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,199
make it for those who are on the ship

3250
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,280
but the ship is part of society

3251
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,480
there's gonna be a ship with sales so i

3252
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,280
think they'll be

3253
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,239
such interesting conversations because

3254
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,920
really you could

3255
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,040
fractal into yeah seven

3256
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,440
what is the role of information i mean i

3257
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,960
went to a conference today on

3258
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,760
only a fragment of that so of course

3259
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,440
seven is going to be a big topic but

3260
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,159
it's a

3261
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:56,800
it's third order science well you did

3262
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,239
with laying out

3263
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:01,520
the second order criticism

3264
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,199
paradigm so it's quite interesting to

3265
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:06,800
read about and learn

3266
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,800
yeah you know speaking of uh speaking of

3267
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,719
a repository

3268
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:13,920
you know at the very least you need a

3269
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,400
language and a means of communication so

3270
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,679
that you can convey

3271
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:20,080
if i have an idea for new systems i need

3272
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,840
to convey that to the rest of the world

3273
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,520
in some way convey to you maybe you have

3274
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,880
your own idea of what a

3275
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,400
new system would look like so how do we

3276
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,000
convey that idea how do we convey

3277
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,639
a complicated idea to each other so that

3278
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,639
we know what each other is talking about

3279
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,480
and then we can start to do tests on

3280
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,560
them or figure out which one works

3281
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,239
better in what situations like

3282
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,719
just just just just to begin we just

3283
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:42,080
need a way to

3284
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,880
communicate a way to present the

3285
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,560
information so that we can understand

3286
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,000
what each other is saying

3287
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,960
just one kind of closing metaphor or at

3288
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,639
least thought that comes to mind is like

3289
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,800
let's say two people like a movie one

3290
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,239
person said i love the special effects

3291
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:57,599
the other one says the special effects

3292
01:56:57,599 --> 01:56:58,639
were super cheesy

3293
01:56:58,639 --> 01:56:59,920
i thought the story the other person

3294
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,760
says i didn't even i don't like movies

3295
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,040
but i like the book

3296
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,560
so everyone can like the movie and the

3297
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,159
point is they're aligned on action they

3298
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:07,440
might even want to hang out together

3299
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,800
they might be part of the fan club they

3300
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,119
might

3301
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,840
have a product related to the movie but

3302
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:12,800
if the proj

3303
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,760
if the problem is framed as okay come to

3304
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,000
consensus on why you like this movie

3305
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,360
we cannot personalize the solution

3306
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,719
so everybody can have a different

3307
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,800
understanding of why they like the movie

3308
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,520
that's playing

3309
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,239
out in front of our eyes and if it's

3310
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:28,960
about

3311
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,880
which part of this movie do you like or

3312
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,080
not like

3313
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,560
we're gonna be arguing a lot and if it's

3314
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,199
like which movies should we watch

3315
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:38,880
potentially that's a different question

3316
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,480
or how should we reduce uncertainty

3317
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,400
about the movie that we should watch

3318
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,960
there's a lot of ways to frame it that i

3319
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,800
would hope would be new

3320
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,360
yeah i think so i think so yeah um

3321
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,880
yeah maybe maybe we should leave it

3322
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,880
there and we'll pick up more uh

3323
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,159
next time and uh

3324
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,560
looking forward john thanks so much uh

3325
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,080
again

3326
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,239
i'm gonna just re-upload this video in

3327
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:05,599
case there's any weirdness with the live

3328
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,719
stream so be high quality and just

3329
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:10,719
uh we'll be in touch about planning

3330
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:12,239
these upcoming sessions but

3331
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,480
we will know that we will meet next week

3332
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,080
on april 20th

3333
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:19,360
at 3 p.m pacific pdt

3334
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:23,040
for the third session of n

3335
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,239
of bleep okay sounds good see you later

3336
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:26,639
john

3337
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:33,440
peace okay bye bye
