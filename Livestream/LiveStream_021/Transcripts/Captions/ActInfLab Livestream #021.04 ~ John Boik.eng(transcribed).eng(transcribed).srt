1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,360
hello and welcome

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
welcome to actin flab we're in live

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,600
stream number 21.04

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
on april 27th 2021

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,199
and today we are in the fourth of a

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,119
series of conversations with

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,800
john boyk so john it's been really

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
awesome to get to know about you

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
and your ideas and work with you on

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
these jamboards

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
so as i sort of set things up for a

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,239
second and share the jamboard link with

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,280
the live chat

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
go ahead and just re re-catch us up and

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
then i'll meet you on the first slide in

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
just a minute

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
okay sounds good thanks uh so

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
my name is john boyk i'm a courtesy

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
faculty at oregon state university

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
um and the series of discussions that

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
we've been having is on the

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,920
is on a paper a series of papers that i

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
just published in the journal

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
um sustainability it's a three-part

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,479
series the topic is

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,159
well the title is science driven

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,600
societal transformation

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
parts one two and three so uh

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
we've this is our fourth get together

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,720
here and we're just finishing up our

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
discussion of the last in that series

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,840
part three

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
which which is uh the subtitle design

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
and um we we covered quite a bit in that

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,960
paper in that paper

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,439
part three but now today we're going to

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
focus on just one aspect of that

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,479
which is uh the leader framework um

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
local economic direct democracy

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
association framework

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
this is a what i'm i'm terming it a

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,280
prototype of design for new societal

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,320
systems

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
and as a reminder to listeners we're

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,360
talking about the

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
the de novo design of new societal

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
systems

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,159
using specifically club model so the

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,840
societal systems for

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
a club the club is a is a small

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
community

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,119
somewhere something larger than say a

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:05,840
thousand

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,679
volunteer participants that's how the

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,080
in the art the series itself proposes an

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
r d program

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
and that's uh the strategy for change in

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,680
the r d

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
program is new systems are tested at the

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
club level the community level

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
in cooperation with the global

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,360
scientific community who's working on

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
the technical aspects

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,760
then field trials occur at the club

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
level and if the

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
if the new systems deliver as promised

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
and they promise substantial improvement

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,760
and uh social and environmental quality

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
economic

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,120
security and various things like that

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
then the idea is that the club model

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,080
would

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
grow and spread and describe to new

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,120
locations

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
and uh new testing and new trials and

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,599
eventually would spread near on a near

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
global basis

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
so are we on slide one yet we're ready

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
on slide one

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,319
okay so that's our that's just our uh

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,120
our list of

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
discussions we've had you can check out

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
the links there for

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
uh the previous youtube videos

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
and slide two if you would go there

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
is uh just where just where to go for

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,440
more information so the

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
the my website for this project is

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
called principal societiesproject.org

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
and it uh lists the uh gives links to

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
the series get some backgrounds

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,680
information

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
um actually has a it on there is a

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
live or interactive model of the leader

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,879
framework

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
so so part of what will be a big part of

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
what we'll be talking about today is

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
actually on the website if you want to

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
run the model yourself

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
so they go there for more information

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,480
and then

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
third slide

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
so today's topic again is the leader

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,120
framework

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
local economic director democracy

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
association

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
these are ideas from my 24

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
2014 book called economic direct

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,840
democracy

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
that book is available for free on the

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
website or if you

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,519
want to spend money you can go to amazon

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,329
and buy it there

114
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,680
[Music]

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
and along with that book i published a

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
simulation model

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,440
of leader framework or at least parts of

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
the little leader framework

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,360
and that is in the international

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
journal of community currency research

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
so links are there for that

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
and again all of these links are

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
available on the principal societies

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,440
project website

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
okay so now why would i want to discuss

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,280
this is

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
slide 4 why would i want to discuss the

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,320
leader

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,199
framework in this three-part series a

130
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,320
few reasons one

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
is that the leader the design of the

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
leader framework

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,520
maybe should say that the leader

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
framework is intended as an

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
integrated societal systems architecture

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
or what i've been calling a cognitive

137
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
architecture the the idea behind this

138
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
whole series behind this work

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
is that a society large or small is a

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
cognitive organism

141
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
and its societal systems which for

142
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,440
example

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
economic systems legal systems

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
governance systems etc

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
act as a cognitive architecture so

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,199
so when discussing the idea of societal

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,400
transformation

148
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,680
my focus here is on uh creating new

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
societal systems

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,520
de novo societal systems design

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,039
uh so that they function uh

152
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,840
as cognitive systems they facilitate

153
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,400
societal cognition

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
and and this is a fitness-based

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,919
evidence-based

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
r d project so the idea would be that

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
you could assess

158
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,560
how well some did one how well one

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,759
design

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,720
is doing over another design and

161
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
eventually

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,240
communities could choose designs that

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
function very well and are fit for

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
purpose

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
all right so the lida framework embodies

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
the cognitive viewpoint

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
it also was designed uh to be

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
implemented via the club model which i

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,560
talked about in part two of the series

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
that's the strategy for change um number

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,759
three is

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
here the reason is that it involves

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
integrated systems

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
so uh there's i in the in the series i

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
talk about six overarching systems

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
legal governance etc and the the leader

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,360
framework uh

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
integrates most of them and finally

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
there's a published simulation model

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,759
available at least for the

181
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
economic some economic aspects of the

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
leader framework

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
and at the time and i think that still

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
might be true this is the first

185
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,800
semi-realistic simulation of a de novo

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
system a de novo

187
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,280
economic system that i'm aware aware of

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
number five all right

189
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
so i'll get into the we'll talk a lot

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
about the simulation today and a little

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,680
bit about the

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
you know the the uh structure of the

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,800
leader

194
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
but let me just offer a few warm-up

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
thoughts uh

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,639
um the

197
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
the lita economy is not like what we

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
face a normal economy

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,199
that's it's it's fundamentally different

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,840
and in particular it is a

201
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
democratic uh it is a cognitive

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
architecture as i've said and it

203
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
is deeply democratic and transparent so

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
in the in the lead

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
economy money there is money both the

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
national currency

207
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,520
in america the dollar and

208
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
a local digital currency that i call the

209
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
token

210
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,240
so those two currencies

211
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
are used as a voting tool in a highly

212
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
transparent fair

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
and deeply democratic process and as we

214
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,960
talked about last time

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
money is already used as a voting tool

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,639
in our

217
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,160
world it's just that it is a

218
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,360
non-transparent non-democratic voting

219
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,479
tool for the most part

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,000
there's some people have billions of

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
votes in the economic system and then

222
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
other people have just

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,159
you know a small number of votes so uh

224
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
the leader framework makes that voting

225
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
function explicit and

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
fair and democratic the uh

227
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
the emphasis of the simulation we'll be

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,919
talking about in a moment is on the

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
economic system but

230
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
as i mentioned the leader framework

231
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
encompasses the

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
you know all or almost all six

233
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
um overarching systems

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
i i this

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
this simulation is intended as a

236
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
first step and uh it is it's been it

237
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
could be made more sophisticated

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
and uh this so this first one simply

239
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
looks at the economic aspects

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
aspects because that was the simplest to

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
do for me at the time

242
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
um so money is used as a voting tool

243
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,880
and it's and voting occurs in two arenas

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,000
it occurs in local markets so i buy

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,959
some product from from a local store for

246
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,839
example

247
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
local business and it also occurs in

248
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
in the financial system what i call the

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,680
crowd-based financial system

250
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
and we'll talk a lot about that but

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
essentially

252
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
individuals contribute a certain amount

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,600
of their

254
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
income to the crowd-based financial

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,800
system

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
and then once their money is in the

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
crowd-based financial system the cbfs

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
then they have uh they get to choose how

259
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,760
that money is used

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,279
so in a sense they get to vote for

261
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
they give and offer their votes for how

262
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,560
the community

263
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
is what the community wants what the

264
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
community wants to fund

265
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
how what kind of jobs the community

266
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
wants to fund and so on

267
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
um so if you had a

268
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
if you had an economic system in which

269
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
money was used as a voting tool

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
well uh it would be a fairly

271
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,720
undemocratic

272
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
unless incomes and wealth were somehow

273
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
equal

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
so over time the effect of the leader

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,279
is to equalize incoming wealth

276
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,880
and i'll show the show the results of

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
that in a minute the

278
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
the latest simulation runs 28 years and

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
as

280
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
you'll see at the end of that 20-year

281
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
period everyone who has joined the club

282
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
uh is enjoying an equal level of an

283
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
equal and high level of income and

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
wealth

285
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
and uh lastly the leader framework

286
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
is designed to focus on motivations

287
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,200
that is the any new system developed in

288
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,680
this

289
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,440
r d program the goal is to have that

290
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
system be fit for purpose

291
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
and as we've talked about the purpose of

292
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,959
a society

293
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,760
the purpose of societal cognition and

294
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,959
the purpose of

295
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
i should say the implicit person purpose

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
of societal systems is to facilitate

297
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
societal cognition and to

298
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,920
and thus to ensure

299
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
that the organism the society

300
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
maintain achieves and maintains a high

301
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
degree of vitality

302
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
so the any new systems developed should

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
be fit for purpose

304
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,640
and and if they're fit for purpose

305
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
almost by definition they will

306
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
facilitate cooperation because

307
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
cooperation

308
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,360
and communication is a part of cognition

309
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
so the lead of framework and what

310
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,600
rewards barriers to cooperation and with

311
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,240
the idea

312
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
that that it makes cooperation so easy

313
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
that cooperation becomes the default

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
behavior

315
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,839
and it also focuses on motivations it

316
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,639
does

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,040
not reward people for

318
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
uh non-cooperative behavior for example

319
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
and that is in contrast to our existing

320
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,920
systems which which i call native

321
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
systems in the series

322
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,160
but i in our in native systems

323
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
i am for uh

324
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
paying my workers a

325
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
very long for

326
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
the society would reward me greatly for

327
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
that and that doesn't occur in the

328
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,360
leader framework

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
partly because income and wealth are

330
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,519
equalized over time

331
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,839
thus the the part the motivation to

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,680
participate in the economic system of

333
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
elita or

334
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
we'll call it we can also call it a club

335
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
model is

336
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
not personal gain but community

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
well-being

338
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,839
well-being of the larger organisms

339
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
are the members of a club are you

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
thinking

341
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,279
uh spatially co-located are they

342
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
remotely located yes

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,240
locally in space and

344
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,040
it is it was perhaps possible to have a

345
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
club that is

346
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
distributed over over space

347
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,760
but um i didn't start that way i mean

348
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,160
that

349
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
maybe could be something that's added

350
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
later but i'm focusing now it's the

351
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
easiest thing for me

352
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,800
has been the easiest thing to me for me

353
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
to focus on the local market

354
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,160
local area but there's reasons why

355
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,880
the local area is important because many

356
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
decisions actually are local

357
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
like who will pick up my garbage and

358
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
where will that garbage go

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
is a local decision you think the many

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,800
of the decisions many of the

361
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,839
of the our quality of life is largely a

362
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,360
local issue for example

363
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
our my economic security is largely a

364
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,560
local issue

365
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,760
and obviously being close in space

366
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,560
allows a greater opportunity for

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
community building and gathering and

368
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,079
seeing face to face and communicating

369
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,160
communicating face to face and getting

370
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
to know each other

371
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
and building a deep sense of friendship

372
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
and community that way

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
but yes in the future communities might

374
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,199
be

375
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
extended in some way and as a matter of

376
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
fact uh the the idea with the leader

377
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
framework or the idea with the club

378
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
model

379
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,320
is that that the initial focus would be

380
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,600
on developing the

381
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,839
tools and systems for clubs for the

382
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,880
project

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
and then that would land systems for

384
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,880
club

385
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
networks so that

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
would be by definition non-local

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
you know non-local engagement because

388
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
clubs might be in different areas

389
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
of the of the world

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
okay uh so

391
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,880
is that right yep um

392
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,959
so there's in the bottom left of that

393
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,240
slide

394
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,199
over in the bottom left that slide i'm

395
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,680
listing the six overarching systems that

396
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,959
i talk about in the

397
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
in the series and you can

398
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,279
you will see that all but leader so i

399
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,560
would i would imagine

400
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,079
you know that if this were developed

401
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,519
further that health would also be

402
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,320
included but i

403
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
just haven't included it yet uh so very

404
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,480
briefly the sec

405
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
this uh seven integrated components the

406
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
first three

407
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
i'm calling uh i call them collectively

408
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
the token exchange system again the

409
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
token is the

410
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
local currency and it and it travels in

411
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
parallel with the national currency with

412
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
the dollar locally

413
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,800
uh there's a token monetary system that

414
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
creates and destroys tokens

415
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
there's the crowd-based financial system

416
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
which i mentioned already

417
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,320
that uh that to be clear that

418
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
cbfs handles both the national currency

419
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
and the token

420
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
it it issues to local businesses and

421
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
non-profits uh it issues donations

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
interest-free loans and subsidies

423
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
and these are all trans transparent

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
through democratic

425
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,160
decision making and it also has a

426
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,199
nurture arm that

427
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,880
people contribute to and members

428
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
contribute to and that

429
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
nurture arm provides income for not what

430
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
i call not in workforce members

431
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,079
so what when i say that the leader

432
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,800
achieves

433
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
income equality over time i mean

434
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
for every single a member so

435
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
you can think of it as every member

436
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
family or however you want to think of

437
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
it

438
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,759
but uh regardless of whether that person

439
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,560
is in the workforce not in the workforce

440
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
ill not ill employed not employed

441
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
in that sense it's it's there's it's a

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,079
little bit like a universal income only

443
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,439
it's a very high

444
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
income same income that everyone is

445
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
enjoying i'll show you that in just a

446
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
minute

447
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,240
and then number three in the in the tes

448
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
token exchange system is the market

449
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,240
system

450
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,720
so these would be local local markets

451
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
that are better members

452
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,679
and uh part of the some of the new

453
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,359
businesses that are developed by the

454
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
leader would are called principal

455
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
businesses principal businesses and

456
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,679
that's a very special

457
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
business model unique to the leader kind

458
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
of like a non-profit kind of like a

459
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,640
hybrid between a non-profit and a and a

460
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
regular for-profit business

461
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
um number four there's a property rights

462
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
system that goes along with this

463
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
for example a club a leader would have

464
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,240
an ip pool for intellectual property and

465
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,559
the

466
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,720
and the club could also manage other

467
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
properties could manage

468
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
real estate properties for example or

469
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
any kind of property

470
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
so it would be democratic decision

471
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,640
making

472
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
you know for property management also

473
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
there'd be some restrictions on the sale

474
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,840
of principal businesses kind of similar

475
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,520
to non-profits

476
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
and that would be high transparency

477
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
throughout so the community would know

478
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
if the community is using money as a

479
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
voting tool the community would need to

480
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,360
know

481
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,799
where their what's happening with their

482
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,960
votes what's

483
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
what was the you know what are the

484
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
choices that the community is making

485
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,559
with with money and so the flow of money

486
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,200
would be

487
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
highly transparent compared to today

488
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,039
um number five is an information and

489
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,400
incentive system

490
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,960
this would include for example education

491
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,280
programs reputation system

492
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
the fitness indexes that we've talked

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
about which allow the community to

494
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,679
understand itself how it's doing what's

495
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,960
going to happen next

496
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
uh how how what is the quality of the

497
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
design that we're using could we improve

498
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
our design

499
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,280
uh and along with fitness indexes the

500
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
last one there's computer and other

501
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
kinds of forecasting and assessment

502
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
methods that would help a community to

503
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,960
understand

504
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,320
what are the trends and how is the

505
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,840
system working and how are we doing

506
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
um number six is the collaborative

507
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
governance system and that has

508
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
three branches administrative

509
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,039
legislative

510
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,000
and judicial so that then covers the

511
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
legal system

512
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,320
and finally number seven is purpose and

513
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,720
we've

514
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
already talked in each of these

515
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
discussions we've talked about the

516
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,880
the importance of purpose and how

517
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
purpose purpose follows world view

518
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,160
and um and and

519
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,000
design and metrics follow from purpose

520
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,600
okay so next

521
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
okay all right so now we'll

522
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
we'll spend most of the rest of this uh

523
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,559
discussion

524
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,400
on the simulation model because i think

525
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
that'll

526
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
that'll be most that'll make the

527
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
description of the leader foreign

528
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
and again uh the the

529
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,919
this is this is a first simulation um

530
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,799
it's it's intended to introduce the the

531
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
leader framework

532
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,159
um and also just to describe some

533
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
general concepts of token dollar

534
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
i'll use dollar as the national currency

535
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,600
if you don't mind

536
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,640
token dollar flow and um

537
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
and it's the third aim of this uh on the

538
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
left

539
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
paragraph there is to

540
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
demonstrate at least uh you know

541
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
conceptually

542
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
that income equality can be achieved

543
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
um that there's some parameterization of

544
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
this model that you some

545
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
you can choose parameters such that

546
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,000
uh this goal of income equality can be

547
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
achieved at the end of the simulation

548
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
the the simulation lasts for about 28

549
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
years i believe

550
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
um so this is not a this is not uh

551
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,320
you know this is the the the concept

552
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
behind the leda is that it

553
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
bootstraps its success it starts small

554
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,240
it grows from there

555
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
it injects like in the very first year

556
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
maybe just a few

557
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
members will will join and the leader

558
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,280
injects a small amount of tokens as the

559
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,799
as the local currency into the economy

560
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
and makes some very small changes and

561
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
then the next year there's

562
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
another few people join it makes some

563
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,799
bigger changes the next year makes

564
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
another few people join and make some

565
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
bigger changes still and the

566
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
the growth of the leader occurs

567
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,200
exponentially fast

568
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
now i would like i would like to say

569
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,640
that

570
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
that the functions of the leader

571
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
how it how it works how it achieves

572
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
these aims how it achieves income

573
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
equality for example

574
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
this would all be worked out far in

575
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
advance before any

576
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,039
field trial ever occurred so what would

577
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,080
actually happen is

578
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,320
there would be say you know who knows

579
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
hundreds or more

580
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
of simulations or papers or at least

581
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
let's say a large number of simulation

582
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
and papers on a variety of topics

583
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
would be finished before any community

584
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
was ever asked to participate in this

585
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
so once that body of knowledge is

586
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,400
developed

587
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
then perhaps the the the program would

588
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,799
say okay

589
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
what is there are there any communities

590
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,159
in the world

591
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,360
that would be interested in

592
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
participating in a field trial

593
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
and if you did participate here's the

594
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,240
list of benefits that you might expect

595
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,720
over

596
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
if this say a two-year field trial uh

597
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
income levels will increase this is

598
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,039
what's going to happen

599
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,240
this is this is how participation will

600
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
increase

601
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,760
this this is you know this the the

602
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
trajectory would

603
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
be laid out through a variety of

604
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
simulations

605
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
so everyone should know what they're

606
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
getting involved in what they expect

607
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,159
from this and

608
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
and there should be no surprises from

609
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,320
the field trials

610
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,679
now that doesn't mean that the community

611
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,360
has no choice in their behaviors and

612
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
what they do with the system they

613
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
the community drives the system but the

614
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
system is designed such to achieve its

615
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,640
purpose right fit for purpose

616
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
um all right so um

617
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
um on the left there i just want to

618
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,679
emphasize this

619
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
that this simulation conveys broad low

620
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
level low resolution design and

621
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,520
intentions for an actual

622
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
token exchange system so i'm not

623
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
predicting that a token exchange system

624
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
would work like this

625
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
this is rather a

626
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,039
illustration of the concept of the token

627
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,760
exchange system in the leader framework

628
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
and obviously this simulation

629
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
can and hopefully will be followed by a

630
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
large number of other simulations that

631
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,880
are progressively more sophisticated

632
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,039
this is a in many respects a fairly

633
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,919
simple

634
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,480
simulation and there is tremendous room

635
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,120
to

636
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,159
expand it and improve it

637
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,960
um but it's still useful and in

638
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
particular that's because i

639
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
made the simulations stock flow

640
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
consistent which means that

641
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
no no monies come out of thin air it's

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
all

643
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,400
you know if money leaves one agent then

644
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,200
another agent

645
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
receives it so all the flows of money

646
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
are accounted for

647
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
and just that alone allows one to say

648
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,559
that okay logically

649
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,600
you know logic mathematically this all

650
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,000
adds

651
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
up um and i would

652
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
lastly i would say that this is a what i

653
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
call a semi-realistic simulation

654
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,320
that is uh income level starting income

655
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
levels resemble real income levels tax

656
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,770
levels tax rates resemble real tax rates

657
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,960
[Music]

658
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
thus the initial conditions are some

659
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
silly realistic

660
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
but but again the simulation is very

661
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,880
simple so i start with

662
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,679
a semi-realistic initial setting and

663
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,240
then

664
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
certain things don't change over the

665
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,279
years it's just sort of

666
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,120
the only thing that actually changes is

667
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
just what is pertains to the lead

668
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,679
itself the members themselves so if you

669
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,799
don't join and meet

670
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,880
in this in the simulation if you don't

671
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
join the leader over the period of years

672
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
then your income stays just what it was

673
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
and um

674
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
that nothing really changed just for you

675
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
you keep the same job and

676
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,320
keep the same family and things just

677
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,279
move ahead

678
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
all right yeah please

679
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,799
okay you could address it uh now or

680
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,760
later but

681
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
what is the relationship between your

682
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,919
simulation and game theory

683
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,600
and what is the relationship between

684
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,520
your simulation and active inference

685
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,679
oh okay um

686
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
okay so um in a this is an agent-based

687
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,679
model

688
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,120
so in that means uh you know

689
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
between the lines that means that there

690
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,120
are individual agents that make

691
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
decisions

692
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,159
of what they want to do and that

693
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,440
determines how the

694
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
the history of the simulation goes

695
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
um in a in a highly sophisticated

696
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,360
agent-based models the agents themselves

697
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
might be very complex

698
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,039
and they might make decisions about

699
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,960
complex situations

700
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
and since this is a just a simple

701
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,720
introductory model

702
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,640
the agents are relatively simple um

703
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
like for example a family and they make

704
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
fairly simple decisions

705
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,760
and the main decision they make

706
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,720
in this uh simulation is whether or not

707
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
to become members

708
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
in any given year does a family want to

709
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,000
become a member

710
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,919
secondly they'll make a decision on how

711
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,520
they what

712
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
they choose a wage option which is a

713
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
construct that i'll talk about in a

714
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,679
minute

715
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,520
so there's not very many decisions that

716
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
uh that individuals will make here

717
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
so it is like a game theory but it's a

718
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,279
very simple game

719
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
and later simulations could be made much

720
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
more sophisticated

721
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,840
and in relation to active inference i

722
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,279
obviously i i might say that i created

723
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,320
these

724
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,399
the book and the simulation model long

725
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,440
before i

726
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
was aware of what active inference was

727
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
so i what the book neither the book nor

728
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
the simulation model

729
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,720
mentions the cognitive aspects and that

730
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
came a little bit later

731
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in my in my development and as the

732
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,559
project developed in my mind

733
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,600
but but one could

734
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,480
easily imagine how active influence

735
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,159
inference might fit into this

736
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,320
for example you know as i said a a

737
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
community

738
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,480
is considered to be a organism

739
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
it's understood as an organism a

740
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
cognitive organism

741
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,240
so just like every organism it has to

742
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,279
fulfill its

743
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,080
intrinsic purpose which is to maintain

744
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,039
and achieve

745
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,480
vitality and it and it

746
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,600
in the active inference scheme it um it

747
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,679
assess it it receives information from

748
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,480
its world

749
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
through its senses it updates its models

750
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,520
it chooses actions

751
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,080
that changes the world and then it

752
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,919
receives new sensations based on the

753
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,840
changed world and perhaps updates its

754
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,240
model

755
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
further or chooses a different set of

756
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,080
actions or continues with the same

757
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,120
action

758
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,240
but but that's how active inference

759
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
works for an organism but that's how

760
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,279
active inference would work for a

761
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,240
community too

762
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,159
the community senses information it

763
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,159
decides you know it learns what it can

764
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,240
learn from the current uh

765
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
sensations it makes decisions about what

766
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
it'll do next

767
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,360
in a variety of ways what will it do

768
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
with its solid waste

769
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,760
where how will it generate energy what

770
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
will it fund next

771
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
uh what what businesses will it fund

772
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
what nonprofits will it fund what is it

773
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
what is its targets does it adjust its

774
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,640
targets

775
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
so these are all decisions that uh that

776
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:17,679
the

777
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,720
organism of a community would make as it

778
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,440
tries to

779
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,840
to achieve and maintain vitality and

780
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,080
fortunately uh

781
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
since this is a fitness-based

782
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,279
evidence-based

783
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,159
program the community would know at

784
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,279
every moment

785
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,960
how it's doing what it's what its

786
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
indexes are it's you know it's indexes

787
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,720
for vitality for example or it's or it's

788
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
indexes for uncertainty about the future

789
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,919
so as it tries as the community tries to

790
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,919
reduce uncertainty about its

791
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,399
essential variables then you know it

792
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,320
would have an immediate

793
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,120
feedback as far as like scores about how

794
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,159
it's doing and

795
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,840
those scores and that information could

796
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,159
help it then to update its models

797
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,440
or uh and choose the same or different

798
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,039
actions

799
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
and so that's the that's how active

800
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,480
inference might fit in in

801
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
the community as a whole but you could

802
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,080
imagine that any

803
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,000
you could focus in on any individual

804
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
part of this stay just a principal

805
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
business

806
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
and the principal businesses the

807
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,399
principal business could also be

808
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,159
thinking about its cognition

809
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,159
in terms of active inference it too

810
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,520
gathers information

811
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,480
and then makes uh makes adjustments and

812
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,360
learns and

813
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,678
chooses actions and

814
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
another example is the cloud-based

815
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,559
financial system itself this is a

816
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,320
decision-making

817
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
organization structure and that whole

818
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,799
structure

819
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,840
could be modeled using ideas from active

820
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,559
inference

821
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
cool it's interesting how you developed

822
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,840
the idea

823
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,640
and applied basically the evolution of

824
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,600
computational

825
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,159
modeling to it and that helped a few

826
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,519
things maybe come out into

827
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,399
relief like that's that multi-scale

828
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,679
aspect and then also

829
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,600
the fact that you're pursuing not the

830
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,279
maximum gdp

831
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
you know not the the total divided by

832
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,120
the number of people

833
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,799
which you're maybe going to get a higher

834
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,159
average with one billionaire and

835
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,519
everyone else has zero

836
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,320
but that's not the pursuit it's actually

837
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,039
a

838
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,559
uncertainty minimizing trajectory policy

839
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,279
sequence

840
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,480
that's starting to sound a lot like

841
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
active inference so it's kind of cool

842
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,480
how it dovetailed together

843
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
right right this is these are these are

844
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,640
you know these are probabilistic this

845
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,679
you could say the community is

846
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,679
developing a probabilistic model of what

847
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,159
will happen next what will happen to me

848
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
and uh and that fits in very well with

849
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
the active inference scheme and

850
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,360
individuals in the community are

851
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,679
developing a generative model of

852
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,000
of how i see the world and what will

853
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,120
happen next

854
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,679
and as a matter of fact since the that

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,039
since it's so important since

856
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,480
anticipation is so

857
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,320
important in cognition the individuals

858
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,600
in the community individual

859
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
organizations such as businesses and the

860
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,640
community as a whole

861
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,120
would be developing anticipatory models

862
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,919
whether those are

863
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,320
formal models uh you know in computers

864
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
or whether they're informal models in

865
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,559
their

866
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,600
in their minds about how how i see the

867
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
world and how i see

868
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
what will happen next if a b and c

869
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,399
happens

870
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,600
so all of that information that full

871
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,240
anticipatory

872
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,440
capacity of individuals and

873
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,399
organizations and the community as a

874
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:28,960
whole

875
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,279
can be taken taken into account in the

876
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,279
leader can be used in the leader for

877
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,559
the for its own good

878
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,519
all right number uh slide eight yep

879
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,279
we're there okay all right so um

880
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,360
this uh this image on the right

881
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,679
really captures much of the much of the

882
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,399
simulation

883
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,159
and much of the idea of the leader as

884
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,279
far as the token exchange system goes

885
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,880
um and before i

886
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,559
describe it i just want to emphasize

887
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,559
once again that the token exchange

888
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,279
system is just one part of the leader

889
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,519
and there's other parts that are not up

890
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,159
not in this simulation at all for

891
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,960
example the governance

892
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,880
governance system is not in the

893
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,159
simulation at all

894
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,960
so this is just flows of currency and

895
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,360
this

896
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,559
uh figure one on the right describes how

897
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
that works

898
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,880
to to simplify this a little bit

899
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,320
let's just look at the arrows in blue

900
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
and the arrows in blue are both tokens

901
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,559
and dollars that flow together

902
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,600
and we could start at organizations

903
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,039
these are the agents of the model

904
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,960
organizing the five agents organizations

905
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,600
persons

906
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,320
cbfs rest of counties which is the rest

907
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,200
of the world

908
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
and government which is local government

909
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,960
um just looking at the blue lines we see

910
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
there's kind of a circle being made

911
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
between organizations persons cb

912
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,840
cbfs and then again to organizations and

913
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,320
that's

914
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,360
essentially how how

915
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,800
how how things flow organizations

916
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
persons are employed at organizations

917
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,679
and organizations pay wages to persons

918
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,280
persons spend money back into

919
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
organizations when they buy

920
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,159
goods and services persons support the

921
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,320
cbfs with contributions

922
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,000
and the cbf fs supports persons

923
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,399
in particular not in workforce persons

924
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,599
with what i call nurture support

925
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,879
the cbs

926
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
also provides loans subsidies and

927
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
donations to organizations

928
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,119
and the organizations pay back the loan

929
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
principal i might add that the the

930
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
concept of loans here

931
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,359
is uh is the token itself is

932
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,040
designed to be a non-inflationary uh uh

933
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,560
um currency

934
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,240
and loans are offered interest-free

935
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,960
so what you don't see here in this

936
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,839
circle i just

937
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,320
described what you don't see is

938
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,599
investment for profit

939
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,079
that does not occur in the system um uh

940
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,000
especially with relation to principal

941
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
businesses it doesn't occur and

942
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
obviously doesn't occur with non-profits

943
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,680
because

944
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,160
non-profits are by definition not for

945
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,280
profit

946
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,720
so so if i'm a person i receive

947
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,680
wages from my employer or maybe i'm

948
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,599
self-employed i sell things to the other

949
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,800
persons

950
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,079
and i have to contribute a certain

951
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,200
fraction of my

952
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,280
income to the cbfs and once it's in the

953
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,400
cbfs

954
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
i can organizations organizations will

955
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,200
apply to the cpfs for loans or subsidies

956
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
or

957
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,400
donations and

958
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,040
i along with my fellow colleagues in the

959
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,839
cbfs

960
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,599
i have a pool i have an account there

961
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,920
and i can decide you know i like i like

962
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
that idea that this new business wants

963
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
to do they're going to make a new light

964
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
bulb or they're going to make a

965
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,960
this is funding for a small organic farm

966
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,520
or whatever the situation might be

967
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,680
i might like what they're doing and i

968
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,520
might see value in it for the community

969
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,440
again this is the investments are

970
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,240
not related to profit so i'm not i'm not

971
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,000
thinking the way

972
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
i would think in today's world in the

973
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
native economy if i have money

974
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,680
in the native economy i'm thinking where

975
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,760
can i put my money that will return to

976
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,720
me the greatest

977
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
gain personal you know my personal gain

978
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,000
and finances

979
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,760
in this system i'm asking

980
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
since since personal profit is not part

981
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
of the picture

982
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,240
i'm asking where can i put my money that

983
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,480
will receive the greatest gain

984
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,760
in terms of fitness scores and community

985
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,520
well-being and quality of life for

986
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
myself and my children

987
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
so those are the kinds of topics that

988
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
become pertinent then

989
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,079
when when the personal profit motive is

990
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,160
taken out

991
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,680
so um so

992
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
again in relation to the native economy

993
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,880
the native

994
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
the government the say the us government

995
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,119
also makes subsidies to various

996
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,839
businesses

997
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,640
but here all these choices

998
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,160
are deeply democratic you know

999
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
given that incomes are more or less

1000
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
equal everyone has more or less

1001
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,800
the same amount of money in the cbfs

1002
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
same amount of currency

1003
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,440
so everyone has a is essentially equal

1004
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,040
say in which which businesses get

1005
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,160
funded which businesses what you know

1006
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,599
whether they get subsidies

1007
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,920
or whether they get donations or whether

1008
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,599
they get loans

1009
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,160
and the reason for subsidies rather than

1010
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,800
loans and donations might be that um

1011
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
well that for one thing you have to pay

1012
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
back a loan so

1013
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,680
if you if a community wanted to support

1014
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
say a bakery

1015
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,680
and they thought that um you know this

1016
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
bakery is really great they don't

1017
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,640
they're they're not making a lot of

1018
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
money so they're not going to be able to

1019
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
really pay back loans very well but

1020
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,720
they're

1021
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,560
maybe even they're operating at a loss

1022
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,960
but there's just such a great community

1023
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,839
resource and we just love this little

1024
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,520
bakery so much

1025
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,839
that we would like to give this bakery a

1026
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,200
subsidy

1027
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
so that it can continue to operate even

1028
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,359
though it's losing money every

1029
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,119
year you know that would be one example

1030
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,800
of a subsidy or there might be we want

1031
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
to subsidize a hospital

1032
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,280
or we want to subsidize any any

1033
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,880
operation that perhaps

1034
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,320
is not actually making money and

1035
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,079
couldn't pay back a loan on the other

1036
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,040
hand maybe

1037
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
some business is doing well and we would

1038
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
be willing to support it but we want to

1039
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,320
give it a loan instead of a

1040
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
subsidy donations really apply more to

1041
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,400
nonprofits and subsidies really apply

1042
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,440
more to

1043
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,680
businesses coach give a thought on that

1044
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,839
john all right

1045
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,960
yeah yeah it's like if uh

1046
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
a person who's granting money has ten

1047
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,320
thousand dollars

1048
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,000
and they're deciding whether they want

1049
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
to be the one who gets to decide where

1050
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,119
the 10 000 go

1051
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,280
or whether they're going to give it to

1052
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
the cafe

1053
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,560
who's going to spend it potentially at

1054
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
other local businesses

1055
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,400
and allocate it a different way and the

1056
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
employees are already taken care of

1057
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,680
and it's going to contribute to public

1058
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
good especially a locally

1059
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,920
um defined one and so it's like yeah

1060
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
i'll let them spend my ten thousand

1061
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,160
dollars that i was

1062
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,520
just going to give away anyway right

1063
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,880
right right yeah so so

1064
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,599
that raises a really a good point that i

1065
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,960
wanted to make is that

1066
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
what's really happening here

1067
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,359
even though it's currency that's

1068
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,359
circulating what's really happening here

1069
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,880
is just it's just a way to ensure that

1070
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
everyone gets the same amount of votes

1071
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,800
in this economic arena and what people

1072
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
are voting for

1073
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,000
is not so much money if money isn't the

1074
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,280
resource the

1075
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,480
this as especially in a mature leader

1076
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,839
the money is circulating

1077
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,640
as all as i'll show later so it's so

1078
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,160
it's not really a shortage of money like

1079
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,760
how will we get the money for this or

1080
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,200
where will the money come from it's not

1081
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
that it's using money as a voting tool

1082
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
to allocate

1083
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480
other resources like if i give

1084
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,000
a um if i support a bakery say with

1085
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,680
with a loan or a subsidy

1086
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,119
what i'm saying is i'm i'm voting

1087
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,920
for human resources of the community to

1088
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,119
be spent

1089
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,040
you know in this bakery i want this

1090
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,240
bakery to employ

1091
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,480
these people and i want the bakery to

1092
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
provide this service to the community

1093
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,079
right so i'm voting for

1094
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,400
the service and the allocation of

1095
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
resources

1096
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
that are embodied in this bakery or it

1097
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,160
could be a hospital or it could be a

1098
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,200
could be anything but

1099
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,880
that's what we're really voting for is

1100
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
how we spend our time

1101
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
what do we what do the humans and this

1102
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,319
what are the members

1103
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,160
in their in their life and their 24

1104
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,000
hours a day and seven days a week or

1105
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
whatever

1106
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
in their year how do they spend their

1107
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,760
time how do we want to spend our own

1108
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,319
time

1109
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,280
what jobs do we want to work in as a

1110
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
community

1111
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,920
how do we want to spend our time do we

1112
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,640
want to be employed by non-profits do we

1113
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,920
want to be employed by

1114
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
regular businesses do we want to be

1115
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
employed by principal businesses

1116
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,839
this is a the evolution of this economy

1117
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,720
is the is the decision-making process of

1118
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,319
a community to decide

1119
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,160
how it wants to spend its time and where

1120
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,599
it wants to put its focus

1121
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,839
and how how what kind of conditions it

1122
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,079
wants to operate in

1123
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,440
okay all right um

1124
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,480
so that's a little bit of an

1125
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,119
introduction to the flow of

1126
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,319
tokens and dollars together um

1127
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,000
uh maybe i will say one more thing

1128
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
before we get off this is that

1129
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
suppose that um and this might be

1130
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,280
obvious from things i've already said

1131
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,720
but i just want to emphasize it but

1132
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,760
suppose that

1133
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,800
me suppose that me and a group of people

1134
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,880
in the cbfs decide like hey it would be

1135
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
really cool to have a

1136
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,520
bicycle manufacturer in our town so

1137
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,240
so together you know the the 12 of us or

1138
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,640
the

1139
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
50 of us or the 100 of us decide like

1140
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,200
yeah let's support this bicycle business

1141
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,079
now every it's natural that not all

1142
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,359
businesses are going to

1143
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,800
make it you know some are going to fail

1144
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
and that's natural and good a community

1145
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
would want to take some choice some

1146
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,040
chances

1147
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,839
and fund some things that maybe even you

1148
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,520
know the reasonable chance it will fail

1149
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,240
but

1150
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,520
if it doesn't fail it would be great so

1151
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,920
so we fund a bicycle business and it

1152
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,079
fails after a few years

1153
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,839
okay fine the same money is still

1154
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,280
circulating in the community nothing's

1155
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,560
really changed

1156
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
now with what has changed however is the

1157
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,319
the allocation of human resources that

1158
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,880
were allocated to the bicycle business

1159
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
now can be allocated someplace else

1160
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,640
because the bicycle business doesn't

1161
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,520
exist

1162
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,079
and in the meantime those employees

1163
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,440
might become then

1164
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,200
not in workforce members right they

1165
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,560
maybe don't have a job for a short

1166
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,359
period

1167
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,680
so they go from the unemployed category

1168
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,880
in the persons or

1169
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
person's box to the unemployed and not

1170
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
in workforce box

1171
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,200
and fine but you know their income

1172
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,319
doesn't really change

1173
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,000
so they were you know

1174
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
they're not out in the street and

1175
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,440
neither is the business owner the guy

1176
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,280
who did the whole thing he's not out in

1177
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,079
the street he's

1178
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,680
his income hasn't really changed too

1179
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,599
much especially if he's a principal

1180
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,119
business

1181
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,839
so he's fine the employees are fine

1182
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,359
everybody's taken care of

1183
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,280
the community took a chance they said

1184
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,640
hey this would be a good experiment

1185
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,680
let's have a bicycle

1186
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,240
shop it didn't work out but now we'll

1187
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,319
just re-allocate

1188
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,319
those resources to something else some

1189
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,960
other decision

1190
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,119
so you know the the funny that when i

1191
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,480
try to explain this to people

1192
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
the the and i'm using terms money and

1193
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,079
currency

1194
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,240
it's really it's difficult for some

1195
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,000
folks to get past

1196
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
their interpretation their the common

1197
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,440
interpretation of what money and

1198
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,640
investment and

1199
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,920
you know currency means and uh this is

1200
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,400
as i said earlier this is a lita economy

1201
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
but it's not like any kind of economy

1202
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,800
that

1203
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,560
we're we we think of this is really just

1204
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,960
a decision this is a cognitive system in

1205
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,560
short this is the description of a

1206
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,480
cognitive system that a certain flow of

1207
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,280
that

1208
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,040
is uses what i call currency

1209
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,440
if i can make a point on that john it's

1210
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,359
like if you use the metaphor

1211
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,040
of money a lot of times people debate

1212
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,200
uh characteristics like fungibility or

1213
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,280
store value or transfer value

1214
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,599
but if we think organismally and we

1215
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,560
think about let's say

1216
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,200
blood flow or neural information or

1217
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,400
hormonal signaling

1218
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,560
like the goal of the muscle cell is not

1219
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,599
to accumulate

1220
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,560
insulin it's to use it as a cue right to

1221
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,240
know when to change

1222
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
and so if you think about inflammation

1223
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,319
flow blood flow no cell needs to hang on

1224
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,000
to the red blood cells and capture

1225
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,520
things around it because

1226
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
it's part of a bigger plan so i think

1227
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,359
that that's a really nice

1228
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,400
attribute you captured yeah excellent

1229
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,920
analogy and that's very much what the

1230
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,680
leader framework is like it's kind of

1231
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,800
like a body

1232
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,880
kind of like an organism that that

1233
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,960
requires the different cells in that

1234
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,800
organism to receive

1235
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,359
blood and food and information and other

1236
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,720
things like that

1237
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
so and also on that point when i say

1238
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
money is used as a voting tool

1239
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,280
even more broadly it's used as an

1240
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,240
information tool

1241
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,920
so the community is exchanging

1242
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
information when they exchange money

1243
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,000
uh uh still on slide eight uh i've

1244
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,400
explained now the blue lines the token

1245
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,599
and dollar flows

1246
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,400
but i haven't explained the green lines

1247
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,119
so

1248
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,160
uh this this

1249
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,400
the new club in this model

1250
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,200
uh as in as in all models for new clubs

1251
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,000
the community

1252
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,040
remains part of the larger world it's

1253
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,839
there's no the club is not segregated

1254
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,520
from the rest of the world

1255
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,359
uh apart apart from the rest of the

1256
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,280
world it is engaging in all the normal

1257
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,800
stuff it's paying taxes to the

1258
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,359
government

1259
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,640
it's purchasing products from member

1260
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
member organizations but also from

1261
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,119
non-member organizations and amazon.com

1262
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,720
or you know whoever

1263
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,960
so uh you know it's it's participating

1264
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
in the normal way and this lead of

1265
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,079
framework or the club framework is

1266
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,119
another layer

1267
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,520
of organization on top of the normal

1268
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,280
world

1269
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,000
um so these green lines are showing how

1270
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,440
dollars are flowing

1271
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,200
and again this is a simplification of

1272
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
the real world but

1273
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,760
it gives the idea of still so persons uh

1274
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,000
are

1275
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,119
paying the dollars in taxes paying their

1276
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
taxes and dollars i should say

1277
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
and the government is also giving some

1278
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
income support to unemployed persons

1279
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,079
that

1280
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,400
also happens uh the government is giving

1281
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,119
dollars

1282
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,960
in the form of grants and subsidies and

1283
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,520
contracts to local organizations

1284
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,640
and local organizations uh i and i

1285
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,680
created this as a kind of a

1286
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,040
simplification but

1287
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,680
local organizations are exchanging goods

1288
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,280
and services with the rest of the world

1289
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,000
so dollars

1290
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
leave the community when an org local

1291
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,079
organization for example

1292
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,040
purchases supplies from some far distant

1293
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,480
business

1294
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,680
and at the same time

1295
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,000
[Music]

1296
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,640
organizations outside of the club

1297
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,839
outside of the county

1298
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,400
are are purchasing things from the

1299
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,200
member organizations too

1300
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,440
so uh yeah so that's

1301
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,319
that's a simplified version of how

1302
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
dollars are flowing

1303
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,520
and obviously now we got a problem

1304
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,720
because uh

1305
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,280
you know we have our first challenge

1306
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,040
maybe you could say one challenge is to

1307
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,960
somehow design this system

1308
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,040
so to reach the aiming number three

1309
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,960
there that income

1310
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,280
is becomes more equal over time but

1311
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,599
now we have the problem we've created

1312
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,480
this this local currency the token

1313
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,040
and we have to pay taxes on income to

1314
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,240
the government

1315
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,720
and we can't pay taxes and tokens the

1316
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,559
government's not going to take it

1317
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,599
so we got an immediate challenge of like

1318
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,280
how do we

1319
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,760
make this thing work so that every

1320
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,480
individual

1321
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,520
has enough dollars to pay its

1322
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,000
the taxes it needs to pay and

1323
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,599
organizations have enough dollars so

1324
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,720
they can purchase

1325
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,440
you know goods outside the county in

1326
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,400
dollars

1327
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,880
and yet and yet the whole thing can grow

1328
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,440
and

1329
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,319
and and reach its the desired aims so

1330
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
how does that happen

1331
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,000
another question designed the question

1332
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
is

1333
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,200
how do you make this thing good enough

1334
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,960
that anyone wants to

1335
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
join like fine i've drawn drawn this

1336
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,319
picture here of

1337
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,480
you know conceptually how it works but

1338
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,000
if i if i

1339
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,359
don't receive anything materially from

1340
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,720
joining why would i join um

1341
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,119
now there in actuality there might be

1342
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,119
lots of soft reasons to join i might

1343
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,559
feel like i'm more a part of the

1344
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,559
community or i might feel like my voice

1345
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,040
is heard more or i might feel

1346
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,079
that uh you know by joining we're able

1347
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:26,400
to

1348
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
make better decisions together about

1349
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
things but

1350
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,240
in this simulation i wanted something a

1351
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,520
little more

1352
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,720
substantial than that so

1353
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,240
so i in the simulation i made the rule

1354
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,760
that a person will join a family will

1355
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,640
join this

1356
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,040
if it increases their income and they

1357
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,240
won't join

1358
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,280
if their income doesn't go up so

1359
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,359
uh that's that that becomes the

1360
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,040
challenge then how do you inject

1361
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,200
enough tokens and get a good enough

1362
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,440
circulation of tokens and dollars in the

1363
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,640
in this

1364
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,680
membership such that

1365
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,720
my my income goes up from joining or

1366
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
at least most people's income everyone

1367
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
that joins their income goes up

1368
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,200
and uh how then how many people have to

1369
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,839
join to make this thing work

1370
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,400
like two percent of the population in 30

1371
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,760
years or 50

1372
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,240
percent of the population or 90 of the

1373
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
population like what what does it take

1374
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,440
so these are all the questions that

1375
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,520
we're going to dive into next

1376
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,359
uh uh first a few assumptions just to

1377
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,880
explain a little bit how this whole

1378
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,280
thing works uh the not in workforce

1379
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,680
population is static i think it's

1380
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,720
whatever it is 30 36 or something like

1381
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,000
that you know there's just

1382
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,559
a big as in the normal world a big chunk

1383
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,440
of people

1384
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
don't participate in the workforce

1385
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,480
they're either they're

1386
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,000
they're disabled or they're staying home

1387
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,680
they just stay home and don't work or

1388
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,920
whatever reason um uh

1389
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,559
i chose a seven percent uh let's see i

1390
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:02,960
think

1391
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,640
i think the unemployment rate starts at

1392
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,960
about seven percent

1393
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,400
something like that um uh everyone in

1394
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,119
the county

1395
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,680
is uh uh adults and grouped into

1396
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,079
two-person families just for simplicity

1397
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,760
so household income and family and

1398
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,119
computers anonymous

1399
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,119
the purchasing power of the token is

1400
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,720
taken to be equal to that of the dollar

1401
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,920
so when you hear token

1402
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
think value of about a dollar

1403
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,960
and uh structural unemployment is one

1404
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
percent so

1405
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
you know you can't get much below that

1406
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
no matter what you do

1407
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,119
and uh all employed persons work

1408
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,240
full-time you know just a few

1409
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,760
assumptions to make this simulation

1410
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,559
simple

1411
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,960
and again later some simulations could

1412
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,640
be more complicated

1413
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,559
all right give a thought there john yeah

1414
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,960
uh there's almost two extremes for the

1415
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,920
token

1416
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,000
one is actually something that was tried

1417
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,480
in my little town of davis

1418
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,640
california with the davis dollar which

1419
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,839
was a one-to-one

1420
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,920
u.s dollar it was a stable coin before

1421
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,280
there was stable coins

1422
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,040
and so then they pegged the local

1423
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,599
currency it didn't end up continuing um

1424
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,960
it's not active to this day but it was a

1425
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,680
pegged

1426
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,599
coin and then the other alternative

1427
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,720
would be like

1428
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,040
a token that essentially people could

1429
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,880
they could make an nft out of it or they

1430
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,599
could

1431
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,240
go full crypto and they could inflate it

1432
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,760
and speculate on it

1433
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,680
do all sorts of leveraging if it was

1434
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,200
really being traded on the open market

1435
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,960
so there's kind of a continuum

1436
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
between a total protected in-group

1437
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,800
currency something that's pegged to a

1438
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,160
national currency

1439
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,440
all these other options for the

1440
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,359
tokenomics so it's really

1441
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,440
um it's it's an interesting starting

1442
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,800
point but i hope others

1443
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,839
when they're viewing this see that

1444
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:40,880
there's a lot of space for

1445
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
experimentation

1446
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,040
yeah there's great points and um

1447
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,960
yes there's a tremendous amount of space

1448
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,640
for experimentation

1449
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,359
um and and on that note i want to

1450
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,119
emphasize that i'm thinking of this as

1451
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,800
kind of a prototype concept

1452
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,040
is just to generate ideas just to give

1453
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,720
an example

1454
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,000
the goal of the of the r d

1455
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,760
program if it were funded is that

1456
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,920
it would it would evaluate and help to

1457
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,079
evaluate evaluate facilitate the

1458
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,079
evaluation of any number of

1459
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,240
designs and any number of design

1460
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,520
components that maybe are

1461
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,119
interchangeable or can be mixed and

1462
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,079
matched

1463
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,480
so this is just one concept and i would

1464
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,200
hope that

1465
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,640
over a period of years many concepts

1466
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,839
are um are tested you know

1467
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,920
obviously tested first in simulations

1468
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,960
and in

1469
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
in bench scale studies and things like

1470
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,119
that and then if the ideas are really

1471
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,000
good

1472
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,079
then also in field trials in real

1473
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,119
communities

1474
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,599
now having said that though i do want to

1475
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,800
emphasize that

1476
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,720
again this is a science-based

1477
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,599
evidence-driven

1478
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,200
program so so it's not just

1479
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,040
a question of hey what do you guys want

1480
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,720
to do well we want to do this and what

1481
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,000
do you guys want to do well we want to

1482
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,440
do this

1483
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,599
there you actually have to show that

1484
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,559
your design

1485
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,359
is good or better than others or how it

1486
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,319
can at least you

1487
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,640
at least describe how this design

1488
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,400
compares to another design

1489
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,440
in terms of the fitness metrics in terms

1490
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,599
of fulfilling the purpose

1491
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,880
of a system so there's a general general

1492
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,760
agreed upon

1493
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,040
a concept of system fitness and system

1494
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,760
and fitness metrics uh how to there's a

1495
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,960
generally agreed upon

1496
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,160
uh path to assess a system and then any

1497
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,280
design that is

1498
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,119
you know that is uh that is good

1499
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,559
relative to to the

1500
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,640
fitness metrics and and fulfilling its

1501
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,000
purpose then

1502
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,240
you know this is that's the idea like

1503
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,920
any conceivable

1504
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,319
design that improves fitness is a good

1505
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,440
one

1506
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,559
right that's one point now you also just

1507
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,920
on the currency i wasn't actually going

1508
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,440
to talk about this but

1509
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,640
like you brought it up so here we go you

1510
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,599
i think you mentioned

1511
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,319
two kinds of currencies one is kind of a

1512
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,160
potentially speculative currency like

1513
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,440
bitcoin

1514
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,400
another is a currency backed by the say

1515
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,920
the us dollar or something you know like

1516
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,440
you have everyone has to

1517
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,119
put in a dollar and then they get a

1518
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,480
dollar out of

1519
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,920
local currency my concept for the leader

1520
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,960
is neither of those so uh the

1521
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,280
the concept here is that the leader is

1522
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,839
um

1523
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,280
there's a word for it it's escaping me

1524
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,839
right now um

1525
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,839
it is just simply created out of thin

1526
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,400
air this is it's an accounting system

1527
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,440
so in the same crypto thank you

1528
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,839
also crypto is by fiat too it's by

1529
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,920
computational fiat

1530
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,400
yeah yeah so this is by no computation

1531
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,040
though

1532
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,079
this is just fiat but because we need

1533
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:46,960
more current we

1534
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,760
need more tokens so this is an

1535
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,520
accounting system

1536
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,040
and obviously there's a limit to how

1537
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,799
much tokens you create because the

1538
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,880
the concept here is that the token holds

1539
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,720
the value of about a dollar

1540
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,960
so if you created 10 billion tokens and

1541
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,640
flooded a community on day one

1542
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,440
the the token would be worthless right

1543
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,359
it can only be created to the degree

1544
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,000
that it can be engaged with

1545
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,079
and employed in the circulation it's all

1546
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,880
about circulation

1547
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,520
and in particular it's not speculative

1548
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,880
so you cannot sell

1549
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,559
in this system you cannot sell your

1550
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,880
tokens to anyone else

1551
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,359
that's because i in this system i wanted

1552
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,480
people to be

1553
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,520
uh you know engaged

1554
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,280
you know this is like a voting system i

1555
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,280
wanted people to be engaged in the

1556
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,079
voting

1557
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,640
or community choices and it just

1558
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,480
wouldn't be right if i sold my

1559
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,880
votes to some other third party and gave

1560
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,000
them a whole bunch

1561
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,839
that just doesn't mean i can't uh uh

1562
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,119
entrust like in the cbfs for example

1563
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,480
there might be a there might be a

1564
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,720
community organization that says

1565
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,880
like an investment group in a sense a

1566
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,720
social investment group that says hey

1567
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,240
we've been watching you know we pay a

1568
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,279
lot of attention we

1569
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,280
we model the success of businesses and

1570
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,799
the needs of the community and

1571
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,119
if you entrust tokens to us and dollars

1572
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,160
to us we will

1573
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,480
choose good investments for them that we

1574
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,359
feel are the best

1575
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,920
and you know improve the community well

1576
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,200
you can do that that's fine you know

1577
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,000
that's all great

1578
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,760
but you can't sell your tokens to

1579
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,280
anybody

1580
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,040
and obviously then they're not backed by

1581
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,200
any resource dollar or

1582
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,440
otherwise but that's just that's just

1583
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,400
this design so

1584
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,319
as you said you know other designs would

1585
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,480
work differently and you could model out

1586
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,000
which ones improve the fitness of the

1587
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,240
community uh best

1588
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,839
both current fitness and anticipated

1589
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,000
fitness

1590
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,599
all right number slide 10. yep

1591
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,160
um so some additional notes

1592
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,760
um as i s as i said earlier one of the

1593
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,640
aims of this

1594
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,440
of the simulation was to show away a

1595
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,480
logical way

1596
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,520
in which incomes can grow and equalize

1597
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,559
over time

1598
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,880
but another way to say that is that

1599
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,960
elita essentially pays people to become

1600
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,640
members i mean that's how the simulation

1601
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,640
works if their income goes up

1602
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,720
by becoming a member then they become a

1603
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,160
member

1604
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,599
um so you know it's that's a that's a

1605
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:16,720
good selling point

1606
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,680
if if if elita has started up in my

1607
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,799
community

1608
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,760
and i realize that by joining my income

1609
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,400
goes up

1610
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,760
well you know that's a good reason why i

1611
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,240
might want to join

1612
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,760
um and another

1613
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,280
thing is that we'll talk about three

1614
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,960
constructs here that's kind of the

1615
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,160
machinery that makes this

1616
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,400
whole thing go it's the income target

1617
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,079
the token share of income

1618
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,799
and the wage options so we'll be

1619
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,799
describing those shortly here

1620
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,640
um i already mentioned that a leader can

1621
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,920
create as many tokens as it can

1622
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,720
productively

1623
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,200
use limited by inflation concerns

1624
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,000
the simulation goes for 28 years the

1625
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,079
first 15 of that i term the growth

1626
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:00,880
period

1627
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,720
and this is when the number of

1628
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,319
participants in the community

1629
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,680
is rising the number of tokens generated

1630
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,599
by the community is rising

1631
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,319
uh the the club itself the leader is

1632
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,599
expanding

1633
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,280
in in all ways and after it reaches its

1634
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,160
its peak at about 15 years and as it

1635
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,799
turns out

1636
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,960
that's the 90 percent of the local

1637
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,799
population end up joining the leader

1638
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,760
again because

1639
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,119
their income goes up um and then the

1640
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,960
following years the 13 years following

1641
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,559
that are called called the post-growth

1642
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,200
period

1643
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,119
and that's just equalization period

1644
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,559
where everything kind of settles out in

1645
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,760
time and reaches a kind of a

1646
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,720
homeostasis point

1647
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,359
um

1648
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,079
uh let's see here oh uh and on the right

1649
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,920
with regards to the leader we can talk

1650
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,319
about

1651
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,000
family income pre and post cbfs

1652
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,799
right so so if you're if you need if

1653
00:59:58,799 --> 00:59:59,440
you're

1654
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,960
required to contribute a certain

1655
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,680
fraction of your income to the cbs

1656
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,400
well then obviously your pre cbfs income

1657
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,319
will be higher than your post cbf

1658
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,760
cb fs income uh when i do when i do

1659
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,880
comparisons

1660
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,119
here i'm really making comparisons on

1661
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,000
the post

1662
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,880
cbfs income so you can think of that as

1663
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,960
really pre-tax uh take-home income

1664
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,680
all right um and maybe one last thing to

1665
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,319
talk about

1666
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,400
oh go ahead one funny note on that is

1667
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,000
depending on the uh

1668
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,680
governing tax body and how they regulate

1669
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,200
whether a certain kind of crypto

1670
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,280
transaction is taxable or not

1671
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,119
every transaction of a token could be

1672
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,319
considered taxable

1673
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,760
i'm not a lawyer obviously and this is

1674
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,440
the future but i'm just saying that

1675
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,480
depending on

1676
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,799
what kind of overarching tax structure

1677
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:47,839
exists

1678
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,599
it could completely make or break this

1679
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,920
total structure for making it tax-free

1680
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,839
to making it something that grinds to a

1681
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,240
halt

1682
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,760
oh if if uh if this was tax free the

1683
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,520
token was tax-free if i could get income

1684
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,720
as tokens tax-free

1685
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,319
then this whole system is going to work

1686
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,839
like a charm i would say

1687
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,280
i've designed it under the assumption

1688
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,040
that everyone will have to pay taxes on

1689
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
the tokens that they receive

1690
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,960
so uh that's the more conservative

1691
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,920
assumption and

1692
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,680
it and it holds true and we'll show how

1693
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,400
this how it all works out

1694
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,440
um i do want to uh emphasize

1695
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,720
that this that the you know the

1696
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,280
the the kind of the structure of the

1697
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,920
leader

1698
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,720
and the way the cbfs works and the

1699
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,520
contributions to it and things like that

1700
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,400
it's not dependent on the good will of

1701
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,520
members

1702
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,000
these are the it's these all occur

1703
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,960
because of the rules of the club so

1704
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,799
if you want to become a member here are

1705
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,480
the rules the rule is

1706
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,640
you know the you know there's a variety

1707
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,240
of rules that you follow and once some

1708
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,359
of those rules

1709
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,640
are encode what your contributions to

1710
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,079
the cbfs will be

1711
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,160
again once you put the money in there

1712
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,520
then you get to choose

1713
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,559
you know largely you get to choose how

1714
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,520
that money is spent

1715
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,920
all right on to uh eli

1716
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,039
yep so i mentioned that there's uh three

1717
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,720
constructs that sort of drive this whole

1718
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,359
thing

1719
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,240
and the first is the income target i

1720
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,039
also mentioned

1721
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,839
that simulations would be available long

1722
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:24,559
before

1723
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,000
the first field trial ever ever occurs

1724
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,240
so in these simulations

1725
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,079
the community that's being simulated

1726
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,520
would choose an income target

1727
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,680
and that income target is a is a

1728
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,160
increasing

1729
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,680
level of family income up until

1730
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,520
up to a certain plateau

1731
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,960
and it levels up so that path

1732
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,960
the expected path of that increase in

1733
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,880
income family income is part of the

1734
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,799
design of the leader and it's

1735
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,200
and different communities could choose

1736
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,839
slightly different uh

1737
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:05,039
uh um functions or paths to get there

1738
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,119
but that's the concept that that

1739
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,039
everyone knows in advance

1740
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,520
how we're gonna get to this uh plateau

1741
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,200
level you know how many years it'll take

1742
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,319
at what rate

1743
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,440
for example like that um

1744
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,280
a second uh construct is the wage option

1745
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,839
and uh this is to address a certain

1746
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:24,480
problem

1747
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,960
so for example i belong i'm in a family

1748
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,720
my husband and wife team

1749
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,880
and i make a lot of money and my wife

1750
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,559
is not working say as an example well

1751
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,680
then she could join the leader

1752
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,359
and be included in the not in the

1753
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,760
workforce group and she could get a high

1754
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,280
income just from being a member of the

1755
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,000
leader

1756
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,079
but i'm going to stay outside the leader

1757
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,160
because i'm making a ton of money anyway

1758
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,680
and i don't need the leader you know so

1759
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,160
the

1760
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,319
best choice for us would be i i stay out

1761
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,240
of the leader she joins the leader and

1762
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,319
our income goes up considerably because

1763
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,480
of it but that would be a little bit of

1764
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,520
a freeloading

1765
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,920
uh situation and would not be good you

1766
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,280
know it wouldn't be good for the lead as

1767
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,319
a whole so

1768
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,920
to prevent that kind of thing there's

1769
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,000
two wage options

1770
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,039
if our family income is of a is

1771
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,839
as this uh income target rises in any

1772
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,039
given year

1773
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,240
uh if our income target is

1774
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,119
above it or if our income say i'm

1775
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,640
working in some business if our income

1776
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,640
is above the current year target

1777
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,520
then um uh then we choose wage option

1778
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,000
one

1779
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,599
and the and and the club

1780
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,920
will give us a stipend you know above

1781
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,760
our normal income in tokens a small

1782
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,359
stipend so we get a little bit of

1783
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,960
we're doing well we have a lot of money

1784
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,720
because our income is high

1785
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,599
and we join and we get a small amount of

1786
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,920
tokens that we can play with in the cbfs

1787
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,880
and stuff

1788
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,839
on the other hand if we our family has a

1789
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:52,559
low income

1790
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,359
lower than the target and we join then

1791
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,240
we receive

1792
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,319
the whatever current year income target

1793
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,319
is so in the first year that might be

1794
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,079
low but each year it increases

1795
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,200
uh monotonically and by the time the

1796
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,240
simulation is over

1797
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,720
everyone essentially is choosing this

1798
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,240
wage option number two

1799
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,359
and is receiving the um receiving the

1800
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,799
current year income target at its

1801
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,880
plateau

1802
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,440
that's a little bit about that and then

1803
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:19,790
um

1804
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,440
[Music]

1805
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,720
i i should say that the uh i the

1806
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,160
the set of families whose initial income

1807
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,680
is is is below the 90th percentile

1808
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,359
that i consider those the target

1809
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,440
population and as we'll see

1810
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,640
the leader uh increases

1811
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,280
incomes for 90 of the population and

1812
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,400
it's that 90

1813
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,520
that joins the leader by the end of the

1814
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,440
simulation

1815
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,559
and there's also a token share of income

1816
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,240
target tsi target

1817
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,880
that is in any given year um you know

1818
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,799
how are the dollars and tokens

1819
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,920
uh you know what is like if i'm going to

1820
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,400
purchase

1821
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,640
goods and by local community and local

1822
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,520
businesses

1823
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,200
how many tokens am i going to give

1824
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,359
relative to dollars

1825
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,119
that's also a design parameter

1826
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,400
okay slide 12.

1827
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,160
one question is you mentioned a

1828
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,760
two-person household

1829
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,280
where one person had a high income and

1830
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,039
one person didn't um

1831
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,640
and then you said it'd be free writing

1832
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,400
if one person joined and the other

1833
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:26,960
didn't but

1834
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,359
what about one person wanting to join

1835
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,640
who doesn't have an income

1836
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,558
i mean where does that play in

1837
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,039
oh oh oh that didn't play into this

1838
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,200
simulation because for simplicity i

1839
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,960
assume that everyone was in a two-person

1840
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,440
family obviously in a more sophisticated

1841
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,200
simulation you would have young adults

1842
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,079
that are single

1843
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,480
and you know and so on so that the

1844
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,839
simulation just

1845
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,119
doesn't have that level of

1846
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,680
sophistication but i would i would argue

1847
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,400
though that

1848
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,880
i'm showing by the simulation the main

1849
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,839
concepts

1850
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,599
and that the main concepts make

1851
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,200
mathematical sense

1852
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,920
so i i don't think it would be all that

1853
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,280
difficult to have a bit more

1854
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,880
sophisticated simulation where there's

1855
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,640
actually one-person families and things

1856
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,000
like that

1857
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,839
but good point um okay so i'm gonna in a

1858
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:14,960
moment i'm gonna show you some of the

1859
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,280
results of the simulation and

1860
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,119
just just keep in mind that that's a

1861
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,400
simulation for a hundred thousand people

1862
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,680
and i'm using uh for initial income

1863
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,760
values and income distribution i'm using

1864
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,200
data u.s census data for 2011

1865
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,240
from for lane county oregon from the u.s

1866
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,760
census

1867
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,520
so that's that's how i'm making this

1868
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,039
semi-realistic in part

1869
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,000
is i'm trying to mimic the distribution

1870
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,680
that was in lane county oregon in

1871
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,640
2011 and then and then that's to start

1872
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,200
with

1873
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
year zero and then every year it changes

1874
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,559
as it changes

1875
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,240
and if you never become a member then

1876
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,839
your income stays at the

1877
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,440
same level not obviously not in

1878
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,920
not considering inflation in this model

1879
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,200
it's just a simple model

1880
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,160
and so we're kind of explaining the

1881
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,240
concept of inflation for the moment

1882
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,799
and it could be easily added in a more

1883
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:11,680
sophisticated

1884
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,359
simulation um uh

1885
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:16,880
as far as other ways to make this

1886
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,479
semi-realistic i as

1887
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:19,920
at the bottom of the left-hand side

1888
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,839
there i choose a tax rate that is a

1889
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,279
reasonable tax rate

1890
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,479
there's a bunch of other uh

1891
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,198
parameters that i chose to be reasonable

1892
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,319
parameters of what i could

1893
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,679
you know what's a reasonable tax rate

1894
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,399
what's a reasonable tax rate oh i chose

1895
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:36,799
uh

1896
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,880
for individuals i chose ninety percent

1897
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,399
of adjusted gross income you know and

1898
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:40,719
then

1899
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,120
everyone gets a 2500 deduction and you

1900
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,479
know things like that

1901
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,399
so like in the ballpark what that's what

1902
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,920
i'm arguing is that these things are in

1903
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,920
the ballpark

1904
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,158
um and again a more sophisticated

1905
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,238
simulation could look at a broken

1906
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,560
you know like a more complicated tax

1907
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,000
rate or something

1908
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,960
um i also look for example like you know

1909
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,359
what

1910
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,920
what appears to be the average rate that

1911
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,399
people

1912
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,238
donate to nonprofits just in dollars

1913
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,759
just regularly and

1914
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,359
you know i chose a percentage of income

1915
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,158
for that too things like that just to

1916
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,238
just to kind of get semi-realistic and

1917
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,319
it turns out that the simulation is not

1918
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,399
very very sensitive to those

1919
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,319
parameters so they could be changed a

1920
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,080
bit and the same the simulation should

1921
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,679
show the same results

1922
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,920
now on the other hand there's some token

1923
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,600
exchange system specific

1924
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,520
parameters and that they definitely

1925
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,600
drive how this whole thing works

1926
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,000
there's the uh some of them i mentioned

1927
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,080
for the constructs there's the

1928
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,120
the formula is how how uh the

1929
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,920
income target rises every year uh that

1930
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,120
makes a big difference and

1931
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,880
and so to some of the others the the

1932
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,560
amount that people contribute to the

1933
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,040
cbfs makes a difference

1934
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,080
and so on uh and speaking of a month

1935
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,839
they contributed to the cbfs there's

1936
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:54,560
different

1937
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
kind of categories of the cbfs there's

1938
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,239
the nurture category for example the

1939
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,320
subsidy category the loan category and

1940
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,120
so on

1941
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,440
and there's what i call ear marks for

1942
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,960
all of those in this simulation

1943
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,199
like a certain percent of income goes to

1944
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,080
subsidy

1945
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,880
group and cpfs certain percent goes to

1946
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,520
lending

1947
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,679
a certain percent goes to nurturing et

1948
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,120
cetera

1949
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,640
i called it nurturing by the way is

1950
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,800
because that's i wanted to convey the

1951
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,840
idea of

1952
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,520
the community is nurturing itself

1953
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,960
through this process

1954
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,360
it's it's providing votes to those

1955
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,360
people that wouldn't otherwise receive

1956
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:27,920
votes

1957
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,199
from like from their employer so again

1958
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,239
money is a voting tool

1959
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,320
uh okay all right initial employment

1960
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,920
rate is seven percent unemployment rate

1961
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,440
is seven percent

1962
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,000
uh and the initial fraction of employees

1963
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,920
who work in non-profit organizations is

1964
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,760
about seven percent

1965
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,400
now uh when uh when uh when a community

1966
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,400
say the leader existed and the community

1967
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,600
was getting together and

1968
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,480
kind of form forming to use elita they

1969
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,840
would have to make all kinds of decision

1970
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,400
decisions

1971
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,960
like what kind of income target function

1972
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,040
are we going to use how many years do we

1973
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,600
think

1974
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,760
it'll take to reach our you know full

1975
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,960
capacity

1976
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,120
uh there would be a whole bunch of

1977
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,040
decisions like that to make

1978
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,920
and uh one of them would be um how many

1979
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,640
what kind of

1980
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,600
makeup of the our like makeup of the of

1981
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,400
the

1982
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,880
organizations do we want do should we

1983
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
all work for nonprofits like what if we

1984
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,120
what if a hundred what if 90 of us the

1985
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,239
membership actually worked for a

1986
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,120
non-profit

1987
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,640
that's kind of an interesting question

1988
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,159
you know i and i would argue that this

1989
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,040
will work

1990
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,960
the community could choose like fairly

1991
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,400
extreme values and

1992
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,520
should work as long as the system

1993
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,719
continues to function

1994
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,159
as a cognitive system and as long as the

1995
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,000
community is using it to solve their

1996
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,880
actual problem

1997
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,320
so if the community wanted to to have

1998
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,000
most everyone work in the nonprofit

1999
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,400
sector and wanted the nonprofit sector

2000
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:52,880
to

2001
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,360
grow food for the community and provide

2002
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,960
services to the community

2003
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,480
it could do that i think it could do

2004
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,400
that if it

2005
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,480
if it instead wanted to fund principal

2006
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,000
businesses to a large degree

2007
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,760
and nonprofits to a smaller degree it

2008
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,199
could do that so

2009
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,199
this again this is a this decision

2010
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,440
making process is a way for us

2011
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,080
for a community to decide what it wants

2012
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,480
to be

2013
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,520
what flavor it wants its economy to be

2014
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,400
where where it wants its individuals to

2015
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:20,880
work

2016
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,440
like you know being a member of a

2017
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,199
community like this i would want to

2018
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,239
choose jobs that i that are useful to me

2019
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,239
and to others and that i would want to

2020
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,760
work in you know like

2021
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,159
whatever whatever those would be but an

2022
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,520
interesting thing though is if if a

2023
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,000
community

2024
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,480
chose to fund a large part of its

2025
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,320
workforce in non-profit sectors

2026
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,920
it could have say you know a large

2027
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,880
number of biologists out of repairing

2028
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,280
forests and street and streams and

2029
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,120
you know it could have a lot of forest

2030
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,960
workers uh doing

2031
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,800
you know repairing things there could be

2032
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,480
a substantial amount of

2033
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,760
ecological reject narration

2034
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,840
funded from this but there could be

2035
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,760
other things it's whatever the community

2036
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,560
feels

2037
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,560
is going to increase its fitness you

2038
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,199
know it's its capacity its well-being

2039
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,360
its quality of life the community can

2040
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,600
choose not only which jobs to fund but

2041
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,840
what kinds of jobs what kinds of

2042
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,560
organizations

2043
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,560
all right all right uh on to the next

2044
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,440
slide 13. so this is the way the

2045
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,360
simulation occurs and it goes

2046
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,400
uh in annual steps and in each

2047
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,600
in each zone each year the first step

2048
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,560
as new members are added according to

2049
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:36,880
this

2050
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,800
uh expected participation rate and uh

2051
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,199
and some of those people who are already

2052
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,960
working in what i call lead of funded

2053
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,239
new jobs

2054
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,520
l f n j uh that is you know the lead of

2055
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,880
funds an organization but

2056
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,760
that organization might go bust and then

2057
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,120
those people would lose their lead of

2058
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,159
funded new jobs

2059
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,320
and they switch over then to the to the

2060
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,080
unemployed or not in a workforce

2061
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,440
category so uh

2062
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,760
number two every year some people lose

2063
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,000
their jobs some members lose their jobs

2064
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,560
uh the number three the cbfs makes

2065
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,320
nurture payments to those people who are

2066
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,480
not in the workforce who are unemployed

2067
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,679
um uh

2068
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,600
i'm just gonna i'm not gonna go through

2069
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,880
each of these

2070
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,000
but i will not mention number five um

2071
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,760
so the leader has injected tokens into

2072
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,920
the economy you can't pay taxes with

2073
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:32,800
tokens

2074
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,800
so so by definition some dollars have

2075
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,880
to come from elsewhere another

2076
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,760
factor is that in a poor community it

2077
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,440
may have a shortage of dollars

2078
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,840
relative to the rest of the world right

2079
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,640
other other

2080
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,480
other areas in the country might have a

2081
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,920
higher percentage of dollars in

2082
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,440
circulation

2083
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,480
so somehow this club this leader

2084
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,360
has to pick up dollars from elsewhere in

2085
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,360
order to fund its uh you know in order

2086
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,080
to achieve

2087
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,400
the level of income that it's aiming to

2088
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,360
achieve

2089
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,639
and it does that by

2090
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,560
one main one main

2091
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,400
process and that's by

2092
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,719
having a kind of a sophisticated buy

2093
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,239
local program

2094
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:23,280
that is uh it's the

2095
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,480
community is supporting local businesses

2096
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,840
and um spending a good chunk of its

2097
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,120
of its resources in the local businesses

2098
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,760
and then by definition that money is not

2099
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,120
flowing out of the community it's

2100
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,640
staying in the community longer it's

2101
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,719
circulating in the community longer

2102
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,239
and uh it the community obtains dollars

2103
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,600
from elsewhere by uh by having it

2104
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,360
by adjusting its trade balance with the

2105
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,520
rest of the world

2106
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,719
so one of the one of the the

2107
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,679
the statistics that the community would

2108
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,520
be tracking is what is our trade balance

2109
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,800
with the rest of the world how are we

2110
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,600
doing are we

2111
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,760
are we adjusting our trade balance as

2112
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,760
necessary to bring in the dollars that

2113
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,560
we

2114
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,679
want and uh in this simulation

2115
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,280
as you'll see the the the families they

2116
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:15,920
have the

2117
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,679
families actually reach what would be

2118
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,000
considered very high income from this

2119
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,880
the 90th 90th percentile of starting

2120
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,840
income

2121
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,640
so they families would receive quite a

2122
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,080
very high income

2123
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,520
and that would include tokens and

2124
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,920
dollars and as it turns out

2125
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,120
the dollar portion of that is

2126
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,960
about the national average if you looked

2127
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,159
at all all incomes in the u.s

2128
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,159
that community ends up in a sense

2129
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,360
obtaining its fair share of dollars

2130
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,760
so if every community in the country

2131
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,560
were to do this

2132
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,080
there wouldn't be a shortage of dollars

2133
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,400
because those dollars would just be more

2134
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,960
equally dispersed everywhere

2135
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,560
and that's kind of important you

2136
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,239
wouldn't what you would not want to do

2137
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,840
inside

2138
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,000
d program is to design a system so that

2139
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,960
a

2140
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,280
small community can do exceptionally

2141
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,199
well at the expense of everybody else

2142
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,480
so that's that's not what this is

2143
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,520
um so uh number five was that you adjust

2144
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,040
the trade balance as part of these steps

2145
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,000
every year

2146
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,159
and again this is a very simple

2147
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,400
simulation so at the end of each year

2148
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,719
all the individuals spend whatever has

2149
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,560
gone into the cbfs

2150
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,560
or to taxes or for other purposes like

2151
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,920
that they spend that in local

2152
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,760
organizations

2153
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,800
and finally number seven individuals may

2154
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,480
pay taxes to governments in dollars

2155
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,040
yeah so that's it so that's kind of the

2156
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,480
steps you get there that's how it sort

2157
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,360
of works

2158
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,159
mechanically here's some of the uh

2159
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,920
parameters that i used

2160
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,239
over on the left are the kind of general

2161
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,120
parameters

2162
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,320
uh excuse me those are the the targets

2163
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,480
for the for the community so the income

2164
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,600
targets both starting and ending values

2165
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,239
uh and this is for the growth period

2166
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,080
which is a 15-year period

2167
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,960
so the uh

2168
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,199
income target starts low at the

2169
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,360
essentially at a

2170
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,120
what would might be called a minimum

2171
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,480
wage right

2172
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,000
and then it rises up to uh

2173
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,640
over almost 110 000 tokens and dollars

2174
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,199
so

2175
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,880
110 000 family income in currency

2176
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,199
and that is the 90th percentile of

2177
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,960
starting values

2178
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,159
so by the way i've already said that

2179
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,280
every year the

2180
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,120
the club essentially pays people to join

2181
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,560
so uh obviously in year one it's not

2182
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,000
asking anyone to

2183
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,400
reduce their income down to the minimum

2184
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,679
wage right so

2185
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,120
no one is asked to to lose income in

2186
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,560
this

2187
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,280
uh people join because their income

2188
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,159
increases

2189
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,000
now some people might join because they

2190
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,280
just want to be a part of the

2191
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,760
community part of the leader and their

2192
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,880
income would join

2193
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,400
their income would increase too if

2194
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,000
they're above the income target that

2195
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,400
year

2196
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,640
their their income would increase by a

2197
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,080
small stipend paid in token

2198
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,159
so even if i'm making a million dollars

2199
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,080
i can join and i can receive some tokens

2200
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,480
and i can participate in cbfs and

2201
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,450
other things like that um

2202
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:18,880
[Music]

2203
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,719
so that was the table on the left and

2204
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,400
the table on the right are some of the

2205
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,679
ear marks that i

2206
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,239
use in this particular simulation and

2207
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,840
you might notice that the highest ear

2208
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,159
mark

2209
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,480
there is for the nurture arm so a good a

2210
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,080
good chunk of my

2211
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,199
kind of raw revenue come in my raw

2212
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,320
income

2213
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,000
a good chunk of that almost 40 percent

2214
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,440
is going to the nurture arm

2215
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,640
of the cbfs and that's pain again for

2216
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,640
anyone who's uh unemployed or not in the

2217
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,760
workforce

2218
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,960
and uh other than that so some of my

2219
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,719
income goes to the lending arm some goes

2220
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,239
to principal businesses some goes to

2221
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:52,960
nonprofits

2222
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,520
goes to subsidies of various kinds goes

2223
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,280
to donations for nonprofits

2224
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,600
and uh and so on and i also have

2225
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,440
obviously if i'm putting money into this

2226
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,800
lending function

2227
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,360
then i'm building up a kind of a savings

2228
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,719
account in the cbfs

2229
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,920
that if people are paying back my loans

2230
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,880
then every year i'm maintaining a a good

2231
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,000
chunk of money in the cpfs itself kind

2232
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,960
of like a savings account

2233
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,159
i think uh yeah that's about it there's

2234
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,520
a couple of rules of thumb that i

2235
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,199
realized in trying to find

2236
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:28,880
uh parameters that actually make this

2237
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,239
thing go and the

2238
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,120
one rule of thumb is the the nurture arm

2239
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,760
has to

2240
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,440
have a high enough air mark so that that

2241
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,440
actually functions as as it's supposed

2242
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,239
to

2243
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,000
and uh and also the donations earmark

2244
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,320
for

2245
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
local nonprofits has to be high enough

2246
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,560
so that any non-profit that i fund can

2247
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,239
actually pay its employees

2248
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,679
the the the the income target right at

2249
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,639
least the income target

2250
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,719
by the way the principal business one of

2251
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:57,679
the one of the

2252
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,199
things that demarks principal business

2253
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,080
is that it pays no higher than the final

2254
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,920
income target so the final language

2255
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,440
income target is about 107 000 token

2256
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,040
tokens and dollars and uh a principal

2257
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,000
business would never pay

2258
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,880
someone more than that and ideally most

2259
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,239
people who join a principal business

2260
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,920
would become members and

2261
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,280
i think they all would become members

2262
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,440
and participate and delete it itself

2263
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,520
so uh so that's that's a few things that

2264
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,159
distinguish a principle of business and

2265
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,480
obviously a community would want to fund

2266
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,080
principal businesses because

2267
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,239
this is a business model that is

2268
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,280
designed to

2269
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,639
support the lead and club model itself

2270
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,320
so it's it's designed to support the

2271
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,760
community and

2272
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,639
if i were voting in the cbfs i would

2273
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:47,120
really

2274
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,199
you know like i value being a member i

2275
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,679
value my community and i want my

2276
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,400
i want this thing to work and i want i

2277
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,480
want to receive the benefits that this

2278
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,280
system is promising and the and the the

2279
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,960
way to get there or one way to get there

2280
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,080
is to mostly

2281
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,440
fund principal businesses so that they

2282
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,280
are serving the community in the way

2283
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,040
kind of like a non-profit service a

2284
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,800
community

2285
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,600
and and they're paying wages that are

2286
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,120
consistent with how this whole thing

2287
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,080
works

2288
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,560
and they're really being responsible to

2289
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,440
the community

2290
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,639
via this business model and it's really

2291
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,639
in my best interest to support

2292
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,040
principal businesses with you know

2293
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,199
subsidies and donations and

2294
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,560
loans and things like that not that

2295
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,040
not that there's no room for for normal

2296
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,960
for you know regular businesses

2297
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,199
there is you can fund those too but you

2298
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,800
know by and large you want to put

2299
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,639
a little extra emphasis on principal

2300
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,040
businesses

2301
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:46,830
all right um

2302
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,899
[Music]

2303
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,840
yeah that's it for parameters next slide

2304
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,400
now we're going to

2305
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,280
start looking at what actually happens

2306
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,480
um

2307
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,840
uh we have about 20 and we have about 35

2308
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,880
minutes left i think

2309
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,000
we're going to get right through the end

2310
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,520
of this so i may have to go a little

2311
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,000
faster

2312
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,880
as we as we get to the end so the first

2313
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,400
slide on the upper left

2314
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,840
is uh the fraction of the county

2315
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,000
population and you can see in that blue

2316
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,080
line that's the that's the

2317
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,400
the rate at which people the

2318
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,239
participation rate which is

2319
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,840
decided in advance you know this is what

2320
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,360
we expect to happen

2321
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,960
and uh there it goes straight up

2322
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,199
and then it reaches the plateau after 15

2323
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,480
years so that's

2324
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,239
after 15 years 90 percent of the county

2325
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,920
population has joined the leader

2326
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,440
and they've done so because their income

2327
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,040
has gone up uh the

2328
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,520
the if i were if i were if i were a

2329
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,280
member of a citizen in the county and i

2330
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,800
didn't have a job

2331
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,320
well for sure i would want to join the

2332
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,639
leader because i'm gonna get my income

2333
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,639
is gonna go way up if i join the leader

2334
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,760
relative to

2335
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,800
not joining the leader so uh i account

2336
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,000
here for every

2337
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,480
not every unemployed person or not and

2338
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,920
workforce person to

2339
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,679
to to actually join the leaders so they

2340
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:04,960
can be part of the you know receive

2341
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,639
funding from the nurture arm of the cbfs

2342
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,040
um down below that there's the income

2343
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:11,920
target

2344
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,560
the income target the blue line again

2345
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,560
after 15 years it reaches a plateau of

2346
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,520
about 110

2347
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,960
000 tokens and dollars and then it

2348
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,800
levels up

2349
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,280
and and again i want to emphasize that

2350
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,239
at that level

2351
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,080
every community in the country could do

2352
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,560
this this is not preclusive if

2353
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,080
one community does it that doesn't mean

2354
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,320
that others can't every community could

2355
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,000
achieve these levels you know

2356
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,520
based on the assumptions of the model

2357
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,400
on the right is the fraction of income

2358
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,159
uh over the years so

2359
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,280
a fraction in the let's just look at the

2360
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,880
the green line the green dotted line is

2361
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,040
the token share of income target

2362
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,239
so uh in the early years that's a very

2363
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:52,639
low

2364
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,800
fraction most of the income is in

2365
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,360
dollars and then it raises over it rises

2366
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,360
over the years to eventually reach about

2367
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,400
35

2368
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
so at the end of the simulation

2369
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
about 35 percent of incomes and tokens

2370
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,080
and the rest is in dollars

2371
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,040
um and then the fund starts with the

2372
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,520
bottom

2373
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,320
right graph this is the average family

2374
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,199
income

2375
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,520
uh starts at about forty thousand that

2376
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,880
is you know from this

2377
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,679
from the census data and starts at about

2378
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,280
forty thousand and you can see what

2379
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:23,840
happens

2380
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,880
with the blue line over the period of 15

2381
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,360
years

2382
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,480
it uh more than doubles

2383
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,159
so family income more than doubles it

2384
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,400
reaches the 90th percentile of starting

2385
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,840
income

2386
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,679
the red dotted line is showing the

2387
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,520
similar thing only it's including the

2388
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,199
money that people have in their savings

2389
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:41,679
account

2390
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,159
in the in the cbfs so there's a

2391
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,480
two-person family each is contributed

2392
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,280
to a maximum of 30 000 to the savings

2393
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,080
account so

2394
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,239
on top of this high income families also

2395
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,320
have sixty thousand dollars in savings

2396
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,559
in the in the cbfs

2397
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,760
um you might notice that uh you know the

2398
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,800
the

2399
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,480
the all the growth is happening during

2400
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,920
the first 15 years

2401
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,000
but you can tell from the blue line the

2402
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,199
family income line

2403
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,040
at the bottom graph that it there's a

2404
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,639
little bit of a lag it takes a little

2405
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,480
bit of time for the whole thing to

2406
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,000
actually reach

2407
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,719
its maximum

2408
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,760
family income and that happens about

2409
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,159
your 28 or something like that

2410
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,560
i might also mention too that the i've

2411
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,280
just tried

2412
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,719
in this simulation i was just trying to

2413
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,719
find kind of reasonable

2414
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,000
parameters and and a growth period and

2415
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,040
things like that

2416
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
such that it would all make sense and

2417
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,080
would work and

2418
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,239
we're not asking we're not expecting the

2419
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,560
community to change on you know in year

2420
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,040
one

2421
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,719
suddenly everything changes it wouldn't

2422
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,239
be like that it would tend to grow

2423
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,040
slower

2424
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,360
but having said that you could think of

2425
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,960
the simulation as what might happen in

2426
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,880
the first leta

2427
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,199
but imagine that there's already a

2428
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,480
hundred liters or 200 or 500 liters

2429
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,719
around it's really clear how these

2430
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,480
things work there's lots of data coming

2431
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,760
in from leaders all over

2432
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,480
it's clear that incomes are rising and

2433
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,120
the

2434
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,679
interest by the general population is

2435
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:10,639
you know growing

2436
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,679
very rapidly like suddenly it's

2437
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,679
the new thing and everyone wants to join

2438
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,360
because everyone's income goes up and

2439
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:17,840
their

2440
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,360
empowerment goes up and their sense of

2441
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,800
community goes up and they're and

2442
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
they're aligning their purpose with the

2443
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,400
you know some greater good that's

2444
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,800
it feels good you know there's a whole

2445
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,480
variety of benefits that come from being

2446
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,199
a member

2447
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,600
so so now a new so someone wants to

2448
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,480
start a club in

2449
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,520
in another city and suddenly there's a

2450
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,360
tremendous interest on day one

2451
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,880
well then all of this would go a lot

2452
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,800
faster it wouldn't necessarily take 15

2453
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,679
years it might go

2454
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:47,199
you know in half that time or whatever

2455
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,719
uh on slide 16.

2456
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,960
on the left is the unemployment rate as

2457
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,480
i mentioned it starts at about seven

2458
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,920
percent in the county

2459
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,000
and you can see that uh after about

2460
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,440
15 years uh the county achieves

2461
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,320
full employment so uh that all works

2462
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,199
well the lead is

2463
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,880
generating jobs and whether they're

2464
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
non-profit jobs in the nonprofit sector

2465
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,120
or for-profit sector

2466
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,400
the unemployment rate everyone's being

2467
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,639
engaged that wants to be engaged now

2468
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,560
keep in mind that a certain percent stay

2469
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,960
out of the workforce and it just shows a

2470
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,520
typical

2471
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,440
percent whatever that was 36 or

2472
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,440
something so that not everyone is

2473
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,719
working some people are

2474
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,040
doing other things in non-formal jobs or

2475
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,800
whatever term you might want to use that

2476
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,560
you know everyone's engaged somehow

2477
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,400
people are actively engaged in their

2478
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,639
in their lives and in their community

2479
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:37,840
but some people

2480
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,440
who are in the workforce the

2481
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,560
employment rate is very low and and

2482
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,800
the unemployment rate in the club itself

2483
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,080
uh reaches its

2484
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,679
lowest level after 10 years it just

2485
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,280
takes a little while for the rest of the

2486
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,800
county to

2487
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,840
catch up on the left this is uh this is

2488
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,719
the before and after

2489
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,840
snapshot of what family incomes are uh

2490
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,560
the upper graph shows the distribution

2491
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,719
from the census data on day one or day

2492
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:05,679
zero

2493
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,360
and i uh the bottom graph shows the same

2494
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,320
thing on

2495
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,880
the 28th year of the simulation and you

2496
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,639
can see that essentially

2497
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,679
everyone in the county uh 90 of the

2498
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:18,800
people in the county

2499
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,400
are making the income target which is

2500
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,080
just over a hundred thousand

2501
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,679
so so it goes from a

2502
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,800
highly unequal uh income

2503
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,760
to a almost completely equal income over

2504
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,800
the period of 28 years

2505
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,600
let me let me ask a question john so i i

2506
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,960
still see that between 350 and 400

2507
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,600
there's still the uh 10 who don't join

2508
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,280
uh ostensibly because they would stand

2509
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,440
to yeah

2510
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,760
right so how do you take that's great

2511
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,800
they don't they wouldn't join a big

2512
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
oh sorry just how do you take the other

2513
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,159
90

2514
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,199
and make their average value something

2515
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,520
with fewer people working productive

2516
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,400
jobs

2517
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,600
having a higher average than 80 percent

2518
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,920
that's just below 100k in the top graph

2519
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,000
um if i understood the question it's

2520
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,760
kind of what do you do with the night

2521
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,639
with the 10 who don't join and do is

2522
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,560
there some kind of do their income

2523
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,280
somehow

2524
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,000
equalize over time or do they like what

2525
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,800
happens

2526
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,400
well let me just ask again because they

2527
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,400
they don't change so ignoring the ten

2528
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,320
percent whose income does not change

2529
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,040
how do you take the um belt the bell

2530
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,600
curve

2531
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,520
you know right side here which has an

2532
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,280
average below 100 000

2533
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,760
and then by reducing the variance also

2534
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,120
increase the mean

2535
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,040
while potentially having fewer people

2536
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,040
with income generating jobs

2537
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,080
just how does the extra usd

2538
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:52,480
per year come into this system

2539
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,760
okay again i'm not sure if i understand

2540
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,000
the question but how does the extra usda

2541
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,840
us dollars come into this system that's

2542
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,159
through balancing of the trade deficit

2543
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,800
so uh that's how that new dollars come

2544
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,199
in that weren't there before

2545
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,600
right so what the what this club is

2546
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,800
doing essentially

2547
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,360
is adjusting its trade balance with the

2548
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,159
rest of the world

2549
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:18,719
such that it's getting its fair share of

2550
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,679
dollars

2551
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,880
and uh you know the the dollar income of

2552
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,920
the club

2553
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,199
equals the average dollar income of the

2554
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:31,199
of the us at the end of this simulation

2555
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,800
did that answer your question uh

2556
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,080
so it's predicated on basically

2557
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,800
a locally positive economy that's

2558
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,920
generating

2559
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,719
a trade excess to get more usd because

2560
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:45,440
you need

2561
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,760
more usd to pay that number of people a

2562
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,960
hundred thousand versus

2563
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,880
between zero and a hundred thousand and

2564
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,080
so even though fewer

2565
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,040
are making potentially productive jobs

2566
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,800
fewer are not in the workforce

2567
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,960
there's so many more usd coming in that

2568
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,400
we can raise the income for

2569
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,000
them and everyone else i'm just saying

2570
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,159
that that that's built in right

2571
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,239
that's built in yeah that's all built in

2572
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:07,840
yep yep

2573
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
now what i thought you were originally

2574
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,199
asking is what do you do with the other

2575
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:11,760
10

2576
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,560
what happens to them we'll talk about

2577
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,400
that in a moment but i'm going to argue

2578
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,320
that their incomes actually fall

2579
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,960
towards this um this plateau of around

2580
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,639
110 too

2581
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:25,040
i think social pressure social pressure

2582
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,960
would ensure that

2583
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,480
that would be one that would be one

2584
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,960
thing and there's some other reasons too

2585
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,679
um well we might as well talk about it

2586
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,040
now since we're on the topic

2587
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,480
so uh so who's so so let's suppose that

2588
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,239
i own this uh some

2589
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,040
corporate i own a franchise of a

2590
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,239
corporation i would say mcdonald's or

2591
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,920
something could be anything

2592
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,639
and uh i'm you know i take in money from

2593
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,239
the local community they spend money to

2594
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,760
buy my food but then i'm

2595
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,360
sending money outside of the community

2596
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,280
because i'm paying you know franchise

2597
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,520
fees and other things corporate fees and

2598
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,480
other things

2599
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,920
so some of my money's leaving the

2600
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,840
community i'm paying low-wage workers

2601
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,239
and that

2602
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,239
that's what makes this whole model work

2603
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,880
is that i can get low-wage workers to

2604
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,719
you know sit behind the counter and make

2605
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,639
hamburgers or whatever

2606
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:12,480
now what happens when there's no low

2607
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,080
wage workers to choose from like

2608
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,600
everyone's joined the leader everyone

2609
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,719
who i would have paid

2610
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,400
thirty thousand a year forty thousand a

2611
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,840
year is now making a hundred and ten

2612
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,199
thousand a year

2613
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,199
where does my workforce come from how is

2614
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,520
my business model going to even function

2615
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,639
if i don't have a low low income pool to

2616
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,239
draw from

2617
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,400
so i i'm going to my business model is

2618
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,600
going to be

2619
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,000
strained to say the least uh it won't

2620
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,920
work very well it's changing the game

2621
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,320
right it's changing the foundations of

2622
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,040
how the

2623
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,560
normal business works in the world um

2624
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,440
so and not only not only would people

2625
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,880
not be available because i

2626
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,800
because the leader would be paying

2627
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,159
higher incomes

2628
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,639
higher wages but but those people should

2629
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,560
be enjoying their jobs a whole lot more

2630
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,679
they would be

2631
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,280
they would understand that they're

2632
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,880
helping the

2633
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,760
community by working in the bakery or

2634
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,040
wherever they're working it's part of a

2635
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,159
community effort

2636
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,159
to raise the fitness of the community

2637
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,000
right like we're all in this together

2638
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and it's and it's and i'm getting a

2639
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,280
voice of

2640
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,840
decision making by becoming a member so

2641
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,199
there's lots of reasons i would want to

2642
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,000
be a member and

2643
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,520
very few reasons i would want to be a

2644
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,280
low-paid worker at you know

2645
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,560
at mcdonald's or anywhere else and

2646
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,679
that's that's another reason and the

2647
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,560
third reason is there's the ip

2648
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,679
commons that i mentioned earlier um

2649
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,840
so there's all these you know the leader

2650
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,520
has now funded all these new businesses

2651
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,120
some are technical businesses some

2652
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,040
other businesses but there's all kinds

2653
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,719
of property being generated

2654
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,600
in particular intellectual property that

2655
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,239
uh

2656
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,800
that is shared amongst the membership

2657
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,880
amongst the club and maybe even

2658
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,679
between clubs so suddenly there's this

2659
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,130
enormous advantage to

2660
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:55,360
[Music]

2661
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,600
to principal business or to uh to member

2662
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,600
businesses to becoming members because

2663
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,760
you get this you know this volume of

2664
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,480
a free intellectual property and

2665
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,840
standard businesses that are outside of

2666
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,000
this do not have access to

2667
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,320
that to you know they have to pay pay

2668
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,679
royalties to get that

2669
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,920
you know ip stuff so that's another

2670
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,280
reason

2671
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,040
uh and i think there's actually still

2672
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,040
one more reason that i can that i

2673
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,480
had i want to talk about

2674
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,600
well a successful community

2675
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,920
a successful community would have many

2676
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,880
leverage points

2677
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,440
and many ways to draw income in and an

2678
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,880
unsuccessful community would have

2679
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,119
no one wanting to help them except for

2680
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:42,800
the us government paying usd which i

2681
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,960
also saw in the model right that the usd

2682
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,000
is providing

2683
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,080
by the government so it's like welfare

2684
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,480
at the country level

2685
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,920
and also at the community level yeah

2686
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,760
yeah so imagine that's a good point and

2687
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,600
imagine how that's

2688
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,760
in fact say a county government

2689
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,480
county level governance or state level

2690
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,360
governance or

2691
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,760
even federal governance what if it

2692
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,199
didn't have to pay

2693
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,360
like all this unemployment insurance and

2694
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,880
all all these other things

2695
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,119
fees that the government has to pay you

2696
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,080
know when people are

2697
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,400
when people need help right all these

2698
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,840
programs

2699
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,520
and the and all of it is being taken

2700
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,440
care of at the community level by

2701
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,080
leaders and clubs like leaders so the so

2702
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,000
there would be actually like in that

2703
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,040
sense you would

2704
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,920
expect that the local state and gov and

2705
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,119
national governments

2706
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,119
might actually like this concept you

2707
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,400
know because it's reducing

2708
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,520
their liabilities you know that's

2709
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,960
especially at the local government the

2710
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,560
local government as i said the local tax

2711
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,360
revenues

2712
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,159
are double in this in this simulation so

2713
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:46,639
you know

2714
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,480
the county government might go like hey

2715
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,760
good idea

2716
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,199
this is if this could work this is a

2717
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,800
great idea and the

2718
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,480
individuals might say hey this works

2719
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,080
this is a great idea but my income is

2720
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,440
going to double

2721
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,639
uh great fantastic uh just a bit on

2722
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,600
an income obviously with this the lower

2723
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,800
your starting income

2724
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
the more you benefit from this so if you

2725
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,000
happen to be

2726
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,400
someone at day zero where your family

2727
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,880
income is fairly low

2728
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,719
yours is going to have the greatest rise

2729
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,400
compared to someone who's already making

2730
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:16,800
a

2731
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,800
say mid-level income or something but it

2732
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,639
doesn't matter it is like the rising

2733
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:22,080
boat catches everybody by the time it

2734
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,040
gets up to them

2735
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:27,040
up to the plateau after 15 years

2736
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,880
uh some more results on slide 17.

2737
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,159
uh on the upper left hand corner uh

2738
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,440
you can see how much money is

2739
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,520
circulating in this uh

2740
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,199
cbfs and um

2741
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:44,080
i i want to emphasize again again that

2742
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,760
this is a community

2743
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,360
of a hundred thousand people this is a

2744
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,440
small community right so this small

2745
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,560
community

2746
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,119
is now circulating six billion in

2747
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:53,679
currency

2748
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,080
annually that's six billion that it has

2749
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,280
to choose

2750
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,440
about like what jobs do we create what

2751
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,119
what what nonprofits do we

2752
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,520
support what do we want what kind of

2753
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,480
parks do we want

2754
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,239
what is the road quality how's our

2755
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:07,760
hospital system

2756
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,760
whatever decisions this community needs

2757
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,080
to make it's got six billion in currency

2758
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,040
to play with

2759
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,480
so uh an enormous amount and that should

2760
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,159
be enough for the community to

2761
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,639
make whatever choices it wants as far as

2762
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:21,840
like what are we going to do how are we

2763
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,639
going to get there

2764
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,159
are we going to improve our quality of

2765
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,400
life

2766
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,280
and maybe just on that note i will

2767
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,880
mention again we've already said this

2768
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,000
but

2769
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,080
there's no club that's a that's an

2770
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,040
entity even

2771
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,920
in and of itself as clubs start to form

2772
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,719
and

2773
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,600
uh and develop there would also be along

2774
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:44,239
with them

2775
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,000
networks of clubs that are forming and

2776
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,679
developing that are also

2777
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,159
a cognitive system so the cognitive

2778
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,199
system is playing that

2779
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,880
cognitive architecture is playing out at

2780
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,239
the local level at a club

2781
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,400
and it's playing out between clubs as

2782
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,000
clubs need to make decisions

2783
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,320
about how they're going to solve larger

2784
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,840
problems right

2785
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,119
so so again no club is in this for

2786
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:08,239
its own good and only its own good is

2787
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,040
this is a you know clubs are connected

2788
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:11,679
this is a

2789
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,800
greater good project um

2790
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,960
the bottom left these are how the

2791
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,920
workforce gets divided over time so on

2792
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,960
day zero

2793
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,920
most of the workforce is in the regular

2794
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,040
state of businesses

2795
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,080
almost 90 97 is in a regular standard

2796
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,199
business a little bit is in the

2797
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,520
nonprofit sector and obviously zero is

2798
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,360
in the principal business sector

2799
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,320
but after after the period of 28 years

2800
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,600
it achieved some

2801
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,880
different balance of the torque force

2802
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,280
and i just want to say again that

2803
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,040
whatever balance that is it's a balance

2804
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,360
that the community chooses in advance

2805
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,040
right so this just didn't play out by

2806
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,639
itself these are based these are all

2807
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,000
based on community decisions

2808
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,639
all along the way like we want this

2809
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,239
community wants to achieve

2810
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,800
a fifty percent uh you know that to

2811
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,159
split its workforce

2812
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:04,080
uh fifty percent into the nonprofit

2813
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,679
sector or forty percent or eighty

2814
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,520
percent or ninety percent or whatever

2815
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,280
it wants um upper right draft

2816
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,119
are the donations made to nonprofits

2817
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,800
these are dollar donations apart from

2818
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,159
the cvfs

2819
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,320
and i'm just using a like a fraction of

2820
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,239
income goes to donations like a general

2821
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,119
fraction

2822
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:23,520
and you can see that uh donations to

2823
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,679
local nonprofits more than double

2824
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,280
so you know this at least in theory this

2825
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,000
whole system

2826
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,920
is like a boom for county governments

2827
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,400
it's a boon for the non-profit sector

2828
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,520
it's a boon for the education sector uh

2829
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,440
and then everyone else's income is going

2830
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,520
up and unemployment's going down too so

2831
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,760
like who loses the only people that are

2832
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,440
losing from this whole thing

2833
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,840
are the people who hold enormous

2834
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,280
economic power

2835
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,840
on day zero you know like those people

2836
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,760
aren't really gaining from this

2837
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,320
and if lots and lots of clubs were to

2838
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,840
you know lots of lots of cities were to

2839
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,280
implement clubs and this actually

2840
01:40:59,280 --> 01:40:59,760
happened

2841
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,960
in scale you know distributed at scale

2842
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,600
then the real losers in a sense would be

2843
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,400
those who are

2844
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,119
quite you know quite wealthy to begin

2845
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,600
with like billionaires say or

2846
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,320
multi-millionaires because their income

2847
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,080
their incomes would probably drop as

2848
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:18,639
i've mentioned

2849
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,480
over time only because of social

2850
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,600
pressures and because they can't get

2851
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,880
people to work in their businesses and

2852
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,159
things like that

2853
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,159
but at the same time everyone's

2854
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,000
well-being increases so it's not like

2855
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,440
anyone loses everyone

2856
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,679
wins here like the commute the world is

2857
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,520
you know all communities are

2858
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,000
more empowered to solve their real

2859
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,840
problems that matter this is a cognitive

2860
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,320
system

2861
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:42,320
aimed at achieving sustainability and

2862
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,280
thriving

2863
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,679
into the future so there really isn't

2864
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,440
anybody that loses from this

2865
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,280
there's just some apparent losers you

2866
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,119
know and not very many of them

2867
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:54,239
at that um the

2868
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,320
lower graph on this i won't say too much

2869
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,520
i'll just

2870
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,920
explain the blue line there this is the

2871
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,199
number of tokens

2872
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,199
uh that are generated by the community

2873
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:05,520
so obviously in the early years you're

2874
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,600
for the first 15 years you're generating

2875
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,560
tokens

2876
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,320
uh because you're growing in this growth

2877
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,560
period and then after that you have

2878
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,400
the tokens are just circulating and

2879
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,800
importantly they don't circulate outside

2880
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,880
of the membership so if i'm a standard

2881
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,440
business

2882
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,360
i there's no one can oh that's the other

2883
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,800
reason why why

2884
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,320
that my clubs would and club businesses

2885
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:26,639
would

2886
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,800
grow is that if you're not a part of the

2887
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,159
club people can't spend their tokens

2888
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,400
you know at your establishment so i i

2889
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,199
might

2890
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,800
be a local business and i don't want to

2891
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,280
participate and that's fine it all goes

2892
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,480
as it goes

2893
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,080
but everyone else's incomes are

2894
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,600
increasing part of that income isn't

2895
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,880
tokens and those people

2896
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,080
can't spend their tokens at my

2897
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,000
establishment the only way they can is

2898
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,280
if i join the

2899
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,719
if i join the club then they can spend

2900
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:57,840
their tokens at my establishment

2901
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,679
uh page 18 and i think this is the last

2902
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,159
of the results i was going to show

2903
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,239
this is the results just for the local

2904
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,920
government this is tax revenues for the

2905
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,199
local government

2906
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,440
at the red is the tax receipts so for

2907
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,639
this

2908
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,679
for this uh lane county is estimated

2909
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,360
that it starts at about

2910
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,520
a billion dollars annually in revenues

2911
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,199
and it more than doubles

2912
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:23,040
by the end of the simulation so their

2913
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,560
tax revenues go way up

2914
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,719
and you can imagine what counties would

2915
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,320
want to do with

2916
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,040
you know if their revenues tax revenues

2917
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:31,440
doubled

2918
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,560
you can imagine they could put that to

2919
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,119
very good use

2920
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,960
okay then just some final remarks on

2921
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,679
these last two slides

2922
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,560
um and this this first one is something

2923
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:44,960
that we

2924
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,199
just were touching on um what happens to

2925
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,159
the other 90

2926
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:51,520
that don't join the leader right so i'm

2927
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,639
i would argue

2928
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,520
that in the long run even that 10 that

2929
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,520
has very high incomes would see their

2930
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,400
incomes

2931
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,080
move closer to the to the income of the

2932
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,560
target income for the leaders and that's

2933
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,760
for all the reasons that we just

2934
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:06,480
mentioned

2935
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:09,679
that that uh

2936
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,280
business owners don't receive the

2937
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,800
benefit of tokens because they can't

2938
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,920
accept tokens

2939
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,000
uh there's social pressures to belong to

2940
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,119
the club because it

2941
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,119
it's in everyone's benefit for people to

2942
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:20,480
belong to the club

2943
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,440
uh the ip is there's an eye by people

2944
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,199
that people have access to if they join

2945
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:26,159
the club

2946
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,080
and so like a number of reasons maybe

2947
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,560
there was one other that we talked about

2948
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,639
uh so you would you would think that

2949
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,440
you know this is the new you know like

2950
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,119
if this is happening that it's the it's

2951
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,440
it's like who who uses a typewriter

2952
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,560
anymore right

2953
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,040
hardly anybody but it's because

2954
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,880
computers work better for

2955
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,199
type setting you know this is technology

2956
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,719
that's another way to say that this is a

2957
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,560
technology this is a decision making

2958
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,920
technology

2959
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,000
and it's both a soft and a hard

2960
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,199
technology

2961
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:00,800
education is part of it there's you know

2962
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,239
there's all these components to it but

2963
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:03,600
it's technology

2964
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,360
and uh you know that's what happens in

2965
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,199
the world a new technology springs up

2966
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,040
it's it's far better than the old one

2967
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,040
and then suddenly

2968
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,159
the old one is is toast well

2969
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,960
the old one uh becomes subsumed into

2970
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,560
conflict at a higher level so you could

2971
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,280
have different

2972
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,159
uh chains that are competing so uh the

2973
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:22,880
idea that

2974
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,080
still one part for me is that

2975
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,360
just thinking about evolutionary

2976
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,000
transitions in individuality it raises

2977
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,760
the level of conflict to another level

2978
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,119
up from what we've seen before

2979
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,880
with everything that politically and

2980
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,480
game theoretically would come with that

2981
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,199
and the second piece is um um i i don't

2982
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:40,239
update my priors

2983
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,560
based upon models without parameter

2984
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,280
sweeps

2985
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,840
so it's hard to look at a given layout

2986
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,800
and imagine

2987
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,119
but it's something that we actually use

2988
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:50,560
as a north star

2989
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,960
for people who are on that political

2990
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,239
journey they might see that as

2991
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,119
beneficial

2992
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,719
but as you're pointing out people who

2993
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,400
don't see it as beneficial are not going

2994
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:58,880
to join

2995
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,639
until the incentive structures are

2996
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,000
restructured for them

2997
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,960
or that will happen yeah yeah absolutely

2998
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,000
yeah

2999
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,840
and everyone's learning from this so you

3000
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,520
know the communities the world is

3001
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:10,560
learning from this right

3002
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,480
and the world is learning over time

3003
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,080
whether this is even a good idea or not

3004
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,520
does this whole system work

3005
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,199
and obviously if it doesn't work if it

3006
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,199
doesn't produce these benefits that are

3007
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:21,440
that are that are expected in advance if

3008
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,400
it doesn't do

3009
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,159
that then it doesn't work and then no

3010
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,600
one would join because it's a stupid

3011
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,480
system

3012
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,159
right or it has flaws that need to be

3013
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:29,760
fixed or something

3014
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,840
so uh yeah everyone's learning together

3015
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,040
and um

3016
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,920
and uh there could be numerous trials

3017
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,440
going on of different systems at the

3018
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,760
same time and you know try for the world

3019
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,040
everyone can be trying to figure out

3020
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,119
what works best in this what kind of

3021
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,239
systems work best

3022
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:48,159
and um yeah all of that's happening it's

3023
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,280
evolving

3024
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,600
as as we go it's evolving but the

3025
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,639
important thing is

3026
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,719
is that this is a framework to

3027
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,800
facilitate societal cognition you know

3028
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,960
at the local level

3029
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,400
and um if we think of our

3030
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,960
societal systems as cognitive systems

3031
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,679
then it's a

3032
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,400
perfectly reasonable question to ask

3033
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,960
what kinds of system designs work best

3034
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,960
and that's what this whole r d program

3035
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,080
is aimed at just

3036
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,320
asking the question of all conceivable

3037
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,360
designs

3038
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,040
which kinds of designs might most

3039
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,480
facilitate

3040
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,520
societal cognition and therefore achieve

3041
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,239
the intrinsic purpose of a of a society

3042
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,199
which is to

3043
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:29,920
thrive now and in the future so what

3044
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,600
designs

3045
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,440
and you can imagine all kinds of trials

3046
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,040
to get to help answer that question

3047
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:40,560
um next slide and this is the last one

3048
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,639
just a few remarks i've touched on this

3049
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,000
already but

3050
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,280
but an organism is agile right like i

3051
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:47,679
have

3052
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,520
among among other things i have legs i

3053
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,440
can run from danger i can do things i

3054
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,040
can change my behavior

3055
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,440
uh as the community we can we can change

3056
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,199
our behaviors we can we can do whatever

3057
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,360
we need to do to achieve whatever

3058
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,040
task is in front of us or you know at

3059
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,960
least achieve most tasks

3060
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,920
but in particular elita is agile like it

3061
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,080
is flexible it can choose what jobs it

3062
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,400
funds and suppose that you know 10 years

3063
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,280
into a

3064
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,840
into a new club some big thing happens

3065
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,520
or some new challenge that wasn't

3066
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,520
anticipated it just arose

3067
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,600
well this is decision making under

3068
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,360
uncertainty that's the whole concept of

3069
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:21,679
this

3070
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,600
like this whole system facilitates

3071
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,360
decision making under uncertainty

3072
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,199
something new has happened now it has to

3073
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:28,639
the community has to respond to

3074
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,119
this new set of conditions it can change

3075
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,480
its makeup of

3076
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,239
what businesses it funds what

3077
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,320
organizations it funds who does what

3078
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,560
it can act it you know it can change the

3079
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,000
how many people work in the nonprofit

3080
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
sector versus for-profit sector

3081
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,280
it can essentially use it can vote to

3082
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,320
to focus its attention and its resources

3083
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,800
human and otherwise on whatever problem

3084
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,960
it needs to focus its attention on so

3085
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,880
it's agile by design

3086
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,239
and part of that by the way is is having

3087
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,679
a fairly equal income so in our native

3088
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:02,800
system

3089
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,920
if i'm a billionaire it is really hard

3090
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,400
for the

3091
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,239
society to allocate my billions of

3092
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:09,840
dollars for some worthwhile project

3093
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,960
right because

3094
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,119
because of the you know the private

3095
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,119
property laws that's my private property

3096
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,119
and you can't use it right

3097
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:20,159
but if everyone's income is equal then

3098
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:23,199
then everyone is participating in that

3099
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,800
redistribution of attention

3100
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,599
and resources to whatever problem is

3101
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:29,199
important to the community

3102
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:32,560
so uh a community empowers businesses

3103
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,360
with with funding for example and it's

3104
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,199
important that it can retract

3105
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:40,719
that uh support when necessary

3106
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:43,520
so the the design of this whole system

3107
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,560
is such that

3108
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,760
there that things can change uh rapidly

3109
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,440
if need be and the community can

3110
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,119
redirect its attention to whatever

3111
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:53,360
problem it needs to address

3112
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,920
um again the next one there is that the

3113
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:58,480
main resource is not money it's human

3114
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,679
it's human attention and and energy and

3115
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,159
also to some degree

3116
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,960
natural resources but the real purpose

3117
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,560
of money is simply to

3118
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,440
to allocate human attention and human

3119
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,360
energy and resources into those problems

3120
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,599
that actually matter

3121
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,800
and and lastly again uh the leader can

3122
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,960
because of its agility because members

3123
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,040
are choosing what kinds of jobs to make

3124
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:23,440
what

3125
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,320
what sorts of businesses what sorts of

3126
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,520
right what sorts of

3127
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,440
economy it wants it can choose any

3128
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,520
flavor of an economy it wants it creates

3129
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,360
the jobs that it wants to work in and

3130
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,280
the kinds of jobs that the people want

3131
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,800
their children to work in

3132
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,960
so it can do whatever it wants as long

3133
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,880
as it functions as a cognitive system

3134
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,560
and as long as it actually meets the

3135
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,520
essential needs

3136
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,560
of the organism of the community and

3137
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,360
that is uh

3138
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,960
it in a nutshell or not in a nutshell

3139
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,639
that's it in those

3140
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,560
long distances there's the the blueprint

3141
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,480
haiku for the nutcracker

3142
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,119
it is a few levels upstream but that's

3143
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,560
why it's fun to

3144
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,239
have these open-ended discussions and

3145
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:08,880
just allow um

3146
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,239
what you've worked on for so long to

3147
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,000
flow out just hear how you're laying it

3148
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:12,400
out

3149
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:15,599
and maybe in closing out this little

3150
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,760
discussion as we head into the next two

3151
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,040
weeks with the

3152
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,800
group discussions what how would

3153
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,480
somebody get involved

3154
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,599
or where can somebody come into play

3155
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:29,520
after seeing this or reading the papers

3156
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,119
oh well um i can be reached through the

3157
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,199
website principal societiesproject.org

3158
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:35,760
and there's

3159
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,599
there's other resources there so you

3160
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:39,199
know one start would be just to

3161
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:40,639
familiarize yourself

3162
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,440
with the material a bit but we have a

3163
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,560
mailing list

3164
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:46,080
so people can just join the mailing list

3165
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,599
and as things

3166
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,520
progress and as opportunities arise then

3167
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,119
we can shoot you know we can use our

3168
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,679
mailing list to contact people

3169
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:56,960
um this our this whole series is written

3170
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,880
to the scientific community

3171
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
so that's that's my target audience for

3172
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,679
the series of papers and i'm hoping that

3173
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,440
i'm hoping that i can entice the

3174
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,880
scientific community to pick up this

3175
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,880
topic as a worthwhile topic of

3176
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,000
study and endeavor you know can we can

3177
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,080
we as a as a scientific community

3178
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,199
address these issues

3179
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,400
create designs test designs identify

3180
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,880
fitness metrics for community you know

3181
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,960
describe how community cognition works

3182
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,360
and what is how it works best and the

3183
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,800
conditions you know necessary are we

3184
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,360
are we ready to to pick up this topic

3185
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,119
and i'm hoping the answer is yes

3186
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:40,159
because it looks rich to me and on so

3187
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:42,080
many levels could be extremely valuable

3188
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,599
to society it

3189
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:45,679
and obviously it's aimed at societal

3190
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:46,800
transformation

3191
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,440
and it's already quite clear that that

3192
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,880
different groups

3193
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,000
academic and otherwise generally

3194
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,679
understand that bold change is necessary

3195
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:58,400
so this is

3196
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,920
one form of bold change now uh academics

3197
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,840
in particular please do reach out if you

3198
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,239
think if there's any number if you have

3199
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:07,280
some funding

3200
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,040
there's any number of small studies that

3201
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,480
could be done right you know immediately

3202
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:16,080
this simulation could be uh um

3203
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,360
expanded in a number of ways uh a study

3204
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,000
could be done

3205
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,760
just looking at just asking the public

3206
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,760
what they think of deep transformation

3207
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,360
and what they would think of of

3208
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,280
income equality or what that you know

3209
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,560
like laying out some

3210
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,199
possibilities to the public or if you're

3211
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:32,960
in media

3212
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,719
whether that's literature or music or

3213
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,119
movies or documentaries or whatever

3214
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,840
please contact me because

3215
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,679
just getting the word out to the public

3216
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:43,920
that transformation in this sense

3217
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,080
might actually be viable and possible

3218
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,599
that that's like half the battle

3219
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:50,159
is just to say we can do this there's a

3220
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,159
way we can do this this is open to us if

3221
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,560
we choose to take it and uh

3222
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,639
so that that's important there's so if

3223
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:57,920
you got any idea

3224
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,000
about how to what you'd like an idea of

3225
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,679
how to contribute to this

3226
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:07,040
effort then great you know send me note

3227
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,599
it's like either they can read it now

3228
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:10,719
and send you a note

3229
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,320
or hear about it later or not so

3230
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,679
