1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,559
there we go

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,840
hello and welcome everyone it is tuesday

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,119
april 6 2021. and it

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,199
is active inference livestream uh

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,480
series that we're going to be kicking

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
off with john boykier this is going to

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,560
be

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
really interesting because we're going

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
to have three discussions with

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,880
john and i and interactive jam boards

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,238
for people who are

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,280
working with us live or asynchronously

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
and then we're going to be having two

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
group discussions later so it's going to

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,000
be a really interesting

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
look through a really rich world view

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,120
and hopefully a paradigm that we can be

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,280
starting to think about enacting or

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
learning more about what it might look

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,200
like

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
in reality so let's just get right into

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
this interesting set of topics

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
i'm daniel and i'm a postdoc in

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,879
california

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,359
and i'll pass it to john just to

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,280
introduce himself and this series thanks

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
for coming on john

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
thank you daniel i appreciate it i'm

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
happy to be here with you actually

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
um so we're going to talk in this series

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,200
about a series of papers that i just

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
published in the

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
in the journal sustainability that that

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
series is titled science driven societal

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
transformation

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
and uh it covers a lot of material all

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
three papers are kind of lengthy so

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,520
that's one of the reasons that we wanted

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,159
to kind of have some time together talk

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,119
out loud and

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
cover some of the some of the main

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
points

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,880
i am a data science by training just as

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,119
a little background actually phd and

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
and cancer biology essentially

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
and uh uh also i'm a

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
courtesy faculty at oregon state

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,799
university so these

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
pape this series of papers is published

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
under uh

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
my affiliation with osu and

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
uh they just came out this this last uh

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
at the end of last year and this this

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,920
spring so

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
all right so uh i think the jamboard has

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,200
links i

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
won't bother to give the links to them

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
there's also a little short survey a

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
short summary paper uh in sciencex that

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
the link is there so you can also

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
check that out and uh i would like to

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
say that for for additional information

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
you can go to the project web page which

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,280
is

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
brunch principled societies project dot

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
org

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
and there you would find links for all

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
the papers and

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
and a bunch of other material also a uh

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,599
a

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,560
a live simulation model you could play

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
with too

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
so john let me just ask about the three

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
paper format

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
because like three first author papers

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,879
in

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,440
sequence it's kind of a uh there has to

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
be a story there

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
so just

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
the story is the story is i'm verbose

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
no there's there's more to it than that

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
uh you know um

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
i i i had some ideas in mind i mean i

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
i mean obviously that's what the series

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
is about but i had some ideas in mind of

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
of what transformation might look like

87
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,120
and how we might get there

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
but the but i think the ideas are

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
relative are fairly unusual

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
and i i didn't want to just put them in

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
a short paper because without background

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
i think that the ideas could have been

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
easily misinterpreted or misunderstood

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
so i i felt it necessary to

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
explain

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
the background in more detail about what

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
what the proposal actually is and

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
what the concept is it's a it's a the

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,000
the whole series as a whole is kind of a

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
proposal for an r d project science

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,280
driven

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
r d project aimed at societal

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
transformation

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,480
but it's a little bit more than that

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
actually it's it's a it's a it's a way

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,040
to think

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
about transformation a way to a

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,720
context for how we might go about uh

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
societal transformation and what that

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,159
looks like and why we would even want to

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
bother with the concept

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,358
in the first place so uh so

113
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
it just was too much to fit in one paper

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,798
and

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,000
i i had originally written it and one

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
put it all in one paper and then i could

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,360
see that wasn't going to work out it was

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,320
going to be way it's

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
way too long so i split it up and uh i'm

120
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,680
very

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,479
happy that the journal sustainability

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
was willing to publish this they were

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
quite interested

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
so uh so that all worked out really

125
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,880
quite well

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
and maybe i should say too this work

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,000
represents about

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
10 years of my efforts this is kind of

129
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
the in a sense the culmination of 10

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,599
years of my thinking on this topic

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
cool really interesting and i'm sure

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
we'll hear more about some of those

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,400
threads

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
so just the first slide on this jamboard

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
which people are welcome to join

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
if they're watching live or if they're

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
looking at the replay the first slide

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
is capturing how we're gonna go through

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,840
these three

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
parts of the triptych the paper series

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
in order at this same time slot 3

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
p.m pacific for the next three weeks and

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,639
then we're going to be having those

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,000
group discussions so we're going to kind

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,560
of

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
pour over these papers but who knows

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
maybe take a few

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
tangents as well and this principled

149
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,720
societiesproject.org

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
website is where more information can be

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,479
found

152
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
so let's just maybe start with a little

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
background before we jump into the paper

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
on just what collaborative dialogue has

155
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
to do with all of this

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
why are we structuring it this way uh in

157
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
experimenting with it this way and just

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
how does dialogue fit in in specific or

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,360
in general

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,639
to what you're talking about and

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
thinking about

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
well um you know

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
as i mentioned the the series is kind of

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,400
a

165
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
r d proposal for an r d project

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
and while it's important that that

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
the concept as a whole move forward at

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
least it's important to me

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
and funding you know we

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
secure some funding for this project so

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
it can move forward

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
perhaps the biggest thing that has to

173
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
happen is just the

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,680
concept a few concepts a few primary

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
concepts that i talk about

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
just getting those concepts articulated

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,199
out to the

178
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
science world and to the public that may

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,400
be

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
you know if if i die and that's all the

181
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,240
uh that's all that ever happens from

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
this just that those concepts become

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
talked about more more frequently in the

184
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,319
public discussion

185
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
then i probably have done my job

186
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,639
obviously i hope it goes a little

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
further than that but that's the place

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
to start and maybe that's the most

189
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,560
important thing

190
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
um where uh would just

191
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
citizen science or participatory science

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
dialogue with

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
really uh inclusive participation play a

194
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,360
role in the r d

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
programs of the future in what you're

196
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
kind of thinking about

197
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
yeah so so um

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
i i i framed this this r d

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
program that is it's conceptual at the

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
time it's not funded yet you know i'm

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
hoping that we can secure funds

202
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,520
but i frame it as a partnership

203
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
between this global science community

204
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
and local communities

205
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
so it's very so dialogue with the public

206
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
and within the science community and

207
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,039
among

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
interested stakeholders is extremely

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
important in this

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
um i i i

211
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
you know to me science has a role in

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
in such a r d program because science is

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
really

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
the you know the where we would turn to

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
answer some really difficult questions

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,319
like

217
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
if you wanted to build a simulation

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
model of how environmental

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,919
or environmental or economic uh outcomes

220
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,879
might be given

221
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
you know a b c and d well then you know

222
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
that's a that's a technical those are

223
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
technical questions

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,680
um if you're if you're asking

225
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
how can we measure

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
how can what kind of metrics are

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:19,759
reasonable

228
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
for environmental and social well-being

229
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,919
those are largely scientific questions

230
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
you know the math can be complicated for

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
example

232
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
but the questions of you know how do

233
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,799
what do we want what do people want

234
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,159
how how how do they want their light you

235
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
know how do they want to live their

236
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
lives in

237
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,720
in society those are questions for

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
you know for the public and for

239
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
communities especially

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,600
um i i the the intention of the r d

241
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
program is not to develop one size fits

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,279
all

243
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,920
solution you know to trial it in a local

244
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,120
community and then

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
spread it everywhere that's not at all

246
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,959
the idea the idea is that this is an

247
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
ongoing learning process a true

248
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
partnership between

249
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
uh local communities and the science and

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
the science community

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
and there would be just a million sorts

252
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
of

253
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
you know experiments that one might

254
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,600
might might

255
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
run uh to to

256
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
improve the kinds of societal systems

257
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
that we have

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
or that were you know that we're

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
proposing uh

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,959
develop a new system try it out see how

261
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,680
it works

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,440
gather data you know do another

263
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
experiment

264
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
uh all within the partnership of at with

265
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
local communities at the local community

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
level

267
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
i think maybe you know i since i know

268
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
this stuff so well i think that maybe

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,519
i'm

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
i'm already jumping ahead of some some

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,519
uh

272
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920
some concepts that might this all might

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
become clear as we talk a little bit

274
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,399
more

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,200
nice yeah well this slide was just to

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,600
show

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
that there's a bunch of questions that

278
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,640
could almost apply

279
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
to every stage of this model and to

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
every stage of this conversation like

281
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,720
what are we doing here what is our goal

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,959
here what are the next steps

283
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
and how is active inference coming into

284
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,480
play not that

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
active inference good not active

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
inference bad you know we're gonna kind

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,079
of

288
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
go a little bit deeper than that but

289
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
what does this have to do with actually

290
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
having impact

291
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,360
will be something that will be cool

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
because what we're talking about is

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,079
really new

294
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,480
syntheses of the theoretical and the

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
applied

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,279
so that means that we're always like

297
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,880
looking to staple across

298
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,000
the divide in new ways with the

299
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
questions that we're asking and the

300
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,160
teams that we're

301
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
working on the projects and everything

302
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
so maybe we can go to the fourth

303
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
slide and to kind of frame this

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
research line what is the issue

305
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
yeah yeah so so obviously the word

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,880
transformation is in the title of the

307
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
series so this you know the general

308
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,519
topic is

309
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,519
societal transformation and

310
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
although that term alone is a little bit

311
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
you know people have different ideas of

312
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
what societal transformation means so i

313
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,000
want to make

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
a few things clear i especially in the

315
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
second paper i

316
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,320
make the distinction between reform

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,760
and trends and transformation

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
and by reform i mean

319
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
anything that would you know improve our

320
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
government system and prove

321
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
our our economic system improve our

322
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
legal system you know

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
one example might be uh levying taxes on

324
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
the wealthy or something and then

325
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,399
you know using those fees to to

326
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
provide medical services or something

327
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
or altering

328
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,600
how long a representative can be in

329
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
and you know in congress in the

330
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
legislature or something like that or

331
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
ways to

332
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
vote or things like that those really

333
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,240
those are all

334
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
what i would consider reforms and i'm

335
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
interested in a different question

336
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
i'm interested in the question out of

337
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,200
all conceivable ways to

338
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
organize the societal systems and by

339
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,959
societal systems i

340
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,920
really focus on a few of them uh

341
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
governance systems economic systems

342
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
uh legal systems educational systems and

343
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,720
i think maybe one or two others out of

344
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
out of

345
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
that i i view those systems as the

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,920
cognitive architecture of a society

347
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
that is that's how society thinks

348
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,200
through

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
those systems it it learns it adapts

350
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
it decides and and

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
evolves kind of through that kind of

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
cognitive architecture and my question

353
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
is out of all

354
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
possible conceivable ways out of all con

355
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
for example out of all conceivable

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
economic systems

357
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
what ones might be best for

358
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,720
uh for demonstratively showing

359
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,360
that that they're you know they excel at

360
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,760
in

361
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,959
improving or maintaining um social

362
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,360
environmental well-being

363
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
so so even that even there we have uh

364
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
the concept of a fitness coming into

365
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
this that is

366
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
what out of all conceivable systems

367
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,880
which are the most fit

368
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,000
for purpose and now now

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
soon we can talk about what purpose

370
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
might be but you know

371
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,279
that that is a new question that's that

372
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
is a question that's hardly been asked

373
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
in the in the history

374
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,000
and i think maybe um it's only now

375
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,279
that science has the tools and the

376
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,240
theoretical

377
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
understandings that maybe it's maybe

378
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
this is right maybe

379
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,920
maybe it is time that we can talk about

380
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,639
the purpose of a society and

381
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,519
how fit a given system design might be

382
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
very interesting because in active

383
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,040
inference land

384
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
we're really familiar with talking about

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
policy selection

386
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
but we're coming out of the angle of

387
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,320
model

388
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
policy or simulations policy but that

389
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
kind of question about policy setting

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
and then sense making again maybe

391
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,279
different groups use kind of different

392
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,079
terms

393
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,079
but all that sense making and problem

394
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,240
solving has been siloed

395
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,279
and the fact that there's not connection

396
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
and common frameworks to bridge

397
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,800
as you're placing it in one integrated

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,440
brain like

399
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
societal systems as a cognitive

400
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
architecture that's

401
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
not gonna work if the different sections

402
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
are not

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
properly having their within and between

404
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
connections working

405
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
and we're seeing all these different

406
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,720
sectors all these little regions of the

407
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,120
brain

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,199
health governance political legal

409
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,639
justice education

410
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
scientific analytical economic financial

411
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,480
monetary

412
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
you could go to a new site and on any

413
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
given day

414
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,279
see all of these things changing

415
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,600
so very prescient to think about how the

416
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
total system is going to be changing

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,519
and finding new stable states otherwise

418
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
it's going to be just on a spiral

419
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
probably not in the right direction

420
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
right as it seems to be unfortunately

421
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,959
yeah um

422
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,160
yes so so so the idea

423
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
is can we design

424
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
societal systems like economic and other

425
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
systems

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,880
such that the the set of them the set

427
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,000
that is the cognitive

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,959
architecture for for society can we

429
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,399
design them so that they

430
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,120
they are serving the same purpose that

431
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,839
are they are

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
they are integrated not separate systems

433
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
and i think you were you were sort of

434
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,360
referring to that a second ago but

435
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
this the idea here is an integrated set

436
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
of systems that serve a common purpose

437
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
and for which a fitness you know a

438
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
fitness evaluation a fitness score

439
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,839
can be can be made

440
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
is that something that we're going to

441
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
return to is like how do we define

442
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
common purpose how do we make yeah yeah

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
yeah we're going to get we're going to

444
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
get we're going to get into that

445
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
okay just sort of doing some warm-ups

446
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
here there's

447
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
you know unfortunately there's the i

448
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,440
mean maybe somebody

449
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
might do it might help to read this

450
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
whole series twice because the first

451
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
time you are like getting just

452
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,800
the kind of the big picture context

453
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
thing like oh what's this what's this

454
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
what's this

455
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
then maybe on the second time around

456
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
it's a little more clear like ah this

457
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,360
fits in

458
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
that's just talked about in the first

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
paper but it really fits in in the third

460
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,440
paper

461
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
so there's just so many there's just so

462
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
many concepts here it's a little

463
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
it's a little chaotic at first as we

464
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,320
cover some of these things

465
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
right but the framing of the problem is

466
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
not dissimilar then any number

467
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
of other um perspectives it's really

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
synthesizes a lot and there's a ton of

469
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
scholarship in the paper so really i

470
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,040
would recommend

471
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,279
reading it before um imagining that it

472
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
does or doesn't say something

473
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
yeah please yes so i get that a lot yeah

474
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
oh you must you must have meant this but

475
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
i'm not done with the paper just fyi

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
um here on slide five there's the

477
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,160
sciencex

478
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
link that people could click to and what

479
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
is this about or what

480
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,760
was this um showing uh yeah this is just

481
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
a short little summary article that the

482
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,559
science sects published of mine

483
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
and maybe i don't want to be boring him

484
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,000
but i might want to talk about these

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
seven points this these seven points on

486
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,640
the right there

487
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,760
are actually a summary of sounds awesome

488
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,240
because

489
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
people who might like to read it or hear

490
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
it both modalities and you're really

491
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,919
going to unpack it in a new way so no

492
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,799
worries about

493
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,039
even stating it the way you stated it

494
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,000
okay good

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
all right so these are the seven main

496
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
thrusts of the series

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,559
so this is this is the spoiler alert

498
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
so

499
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
yeah so number one uh societal

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
transformation is necessary

501
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,320
if we're to avoid catastroph catastrophe

502
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
and maintain and improve social and

503
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
ecological well-being

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
that's the starting that's this that's

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
where this whole thing starts that's

506
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,240
something

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,360
that's transformation is necessary

508
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,559
number two uh one kind of societal

509
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,360
transformation

510
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
is is a science driven transformation

511
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
you know you can imagine all kinds of

512
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
there could be war uh revolution could

513
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
be a

514
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
a type of of transformation and i'm not

515
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
talking about revolution here i'm

516
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
talking about a science-driven

517
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
evidence-based uh development of and

518
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
migration to fundamentally new

519
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
systems so we're talking about dinovo de

520
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,039
novo design

521
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,160
from scratch right this is so we're not

522
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,679
improving uh capitalism for example

523
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
or represented democracy where we're

524
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
looking at conceivable de novo designs

525
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,440
that might

526
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
be fit or among the most

527
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
fit of all possible designs

528
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
number three is uh now um

529
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,080
you know if i were a genius which which

530
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,640
i'm not

531
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
but if i were a genius and i came up

532
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,840
with the

533
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
greatest plan that everyone could you

534
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
know we could rearrange society

535
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,120
according to this

536
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,799
you know this design uh if there were no

537
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,360
way to a practical way to implement that

538
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,039
then i would have been wasting my time

539
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,320
so a big part of this series is actually

540
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,039
especially paper number two is really

541
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,480
focused on

542
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,039
what what is a how could this actually

543
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
be done in the real world how can how

544
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,080
can you do this

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,760
um so i i claim at least that there is a

546
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
viable and affordable uh way to go about

547
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
transformation that within a reasonable

548
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
span of time

549
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
uh and i and i when i consider 50 a

550
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
50-year program here to be a reasonable

551
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
span of time

552
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
transformation could spread to near

553
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,600
global levels

554
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,520
so um you know we're talking about a

555
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
concerted effort over a long period of

556
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,960
time to reach

557
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,320
a global scale change but that does not

558
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,880
mean

559
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
that no change happens until the 49th

560
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,480
year

561
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
it means that change happens

562
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,240
exponentially fast so maybe in the first

563
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,280
few years there's

564
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
you know there's not a lot going on but

565
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
it goes exponentially fast from there

566
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,559
and

567
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,039
those communities local communities that

568
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,400
participate in this

569
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
r d program would be obviously be the

570
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,440
first to

571
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,080
reap the benefits uh number four

572
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
the and this is maybe one of the key

573
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,679
world view

574
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,679
aspects of this paper number one is all

575
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
about world view

576
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
the proposed program views society as a

577
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,679
cognitive organism and its

578
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,360
societal systems as a cognitive

579
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
architecture

580
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,159
so you know that

581
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,559
if indeed society is a cognitive

582
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,600
organism

583
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
and ours and our systems are part of the

584
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
cognitive architecture

585
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
that already lends itself to ideas of

586
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
how you might

587
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
measure fitness now you're starting

588
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
we're starting to get an idea of

589
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
what is a system supposed to do

590
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,440
so we'll be getting more into that today

591
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
number five the intrinsic purpose of a

592
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
society now obviously if we're going to

593
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
build a new system we have to know

594
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
for what is a new system supposed to do

595
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
like what is an economic system supposed

596
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,440
to do

597
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,120
what is a governance system supposed to

598
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
do what is the

599
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,159
what is the purpose of them so uh uh

600
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
purpose is also a big part of the world

601
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
view in the first paper

602
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
and the i one of the points of the

603
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,799
fifth point is that the intrinsic

604
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
purpose of a society of societal

605
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
uh cognition and thus also of societal

606
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
systems

607
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
is to achieve and sustainably maintain

608
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
social and economic ecological

609
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,679
viability and vitality probably broadly

610
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
defined

611
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
now if you're listening carefully and

612
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
you're of the active inference

613
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
persuasion you'll you'll already see

614
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
active inference

615
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
in here when i talk when we talk about

616
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,000
um

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
sustainably maintain that means and

618
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,720
anticipation of the future all right

619
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
uh i also say here the cognition is

620
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
largely focused on reducing the

621
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
uncertainty

622
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
that our intrinsic purpose will be

623
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
successfully fulfilled

624
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
now and in the expected future so uh

625
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
again we have a concept from active

626
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
inference that is uncertainty

627
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
um the cognitive view opens up many new

628
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,919
opportunities for research

629
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
and and i feel like this

630
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,159
view is really critical if we are to

631
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
truly

632
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
uh have some kind of of

633
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,080
optimally beneficial societal systems

634
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,000
and uh number seven the last one

635
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,880
this proposed r d program like i already

636
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,360
mentioned

637
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
it represents uh it's conceptual now but

638
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,200
it represents a partnership

639
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,799
between local communities and the global

640
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,960
science community

641
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,280
um and the you know neither of those

642
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
are monolithic the global science

643
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
community is

644
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,720
you know it was a whatever however you

645
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
might want to envision it

646
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
a hundred labs or a thousand labs around

647
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
the world or individual researchers or

648
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
groups of researcher teams

649
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
interdisciplinary teams at one

650
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
institution

651
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,080
teams across institutions that is what

652
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
i'm that is really who i'm speaking

653
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,559
i'm in the in this series i'm speaking

654
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
to the science world and i'm

655
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,120
suggesting or offering or or you know

656
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,000
hoping that the science community might

657
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,640
find

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
this perspective interesting and see

659
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
the the benefits that would be the

660
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,799
scientific benefits that would come of

661
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,120
this

662
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,399
the the research

663
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
gains that would come of this the

664
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,919
possibilities that would come of this

665
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,480
and

666
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,760
and and get engaged right so it's kind

667
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,159
of a

668
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,720
like i'm asking the science community to

669
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
get engaged in this problem

670
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
in it and in a particular kind of way

671
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,840
and in

672
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,159
what some people have called a second to

673
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,679
you know whatever the phrase escapes me

674
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,600
in the moment so i forget what the

675
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,679
uh what is the title their second

676
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
second i'm gonna just call it second

677
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
order science but i think there's a

678
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,840
slightly different phrase

679
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,960
very interesting i remember reading this

680
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,159
second order yeah yeah

681
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
second order science so what what is

682
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
second order science and i'm sure we're

683
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,120
gonna again go into it in this

684
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,959
like fractal convo but

685
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,919
and how does everyone play a role in it

686
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,720
right so

687
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,120
so traditional science would be first

688
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,000
order science

689
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
is the the scientist is

690
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,919
removed from the experiment

691
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
that is an observer to the experiment

692
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,279
maybe the scientist sets up the

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,400
experiment but then

694
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,760
steps back and watches the you know the

695
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
results unfold and it just observes the

696
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,880
results and then

697
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
you know does the statistics or whatever

698
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
on the results and

699
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
then records the the uh

700
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
the knowledge gain the aim of that is to

701
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,840
build knowledge

702
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
and you know that's wonderful and

703
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
fantastic and terribly useful and

704
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
important and that is mostly what

705
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,400
science has done

706
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,520
over the you know over the last

707
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,039
few hundred years or so uh second order

708
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
science is a little bit different it is

709
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
the science i would say that is really

710
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,000
appropriate

711
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,520
for for today for our problems today

712
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,559
in second order science the the aim is

713
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
to change

714
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,240
you know change the system change the

715
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,000
it's more about unfoldment of an

716
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
experiment rather than getting to the

717
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,320
end

718
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,559
a certain goal of an experiment the

719
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
scientist is part of the experiment

720
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
it's reflective in nature it's

721
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,520
intrinsically reflective

722
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,159
and it and it really represents a

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,080
partnership between the science world

724
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
and and the stakeholders

725
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,400
so it's a little bit more like

726
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
engineering in a sense

727
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
as more of a flavor of engineering in

728
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
that there's a group of stakeholders

729
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
who want some you know want something to

730
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,640
happen

731
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
and uh the science world is engaged in

732
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,559
building that but it's part

733
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,840
it's like a you know series of learning

734
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,880
together and reflecting on what is

735
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
important and what is of value

736
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,360
so it's very much value driven which

737
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,919
which is

738
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,679
unlike first order science it's not

739
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,159
particularly value driven

740
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,880
so the the the aim is to change and it's

741
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,679
value driven

742
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,520
and the science scientists are part of

743
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,158
the experiment

744
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
really interesting that reminds me of of

745
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,400
um

746
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,799
working uh for the first time really

747
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,200
closely with someone outside of academia

748
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
and then their insistence to include

749
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
stakeholders in the conversation very

750
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,240
early

751
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,559
and that was something that i didn't see

752
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,039
as a practice around me in academia so

753
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
i didn't see it as an affordance i

754
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,320
didn't see it as an opportunity

755
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
in my projects and then when i kind of

756
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
was like well i could contact

757
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
anyone early on potentially and maybe

758
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
even include them in the project

759
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,240
that's um then you realize how closely

760
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,360
clustered

761
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:48,159
all not available

762
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,159
have been organized and so it's really

763
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,200
interesting and uh

764
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,480
and as you pointed out like there still

765
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,640
is a role for the first order of science

766
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,440
because

767
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
it's sometimes you need to make the

768
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:58,960
measurement

769
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
like first order cybernetics the

770
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
thermometer we need to keep the

771
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,559
temperature range second order is it the

772
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
right thermometer you know third order

773
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
should we even be tracking a thermometer

774
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
there's a space right for all right what

775
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,000
is what do we really want

776
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
what do w what do we really value yeah

777
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,120
and and

778
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
maybe i should just inject here too that

779
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,799
um

780
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,320
that you know it if

781
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
if the science world is going to be

782
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,440
involved in

783
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,799
in a value question it

784
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,360
really just has to be like transparent

785
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,159
out front

786
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
like this is what we're doing as opposed

787
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
to more

788
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,440
uh you know obtuse

789
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,760
we're actually making value statements

790
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,440
but we're sort of hiding them

791
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
in first order science language you know

792
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,520
so it just has to be transparent

793
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
this is what we're doing this is what

794
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
it's about we're

795
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
we're learning together we're evolving

796
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
solutions to

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
real problems that's that humanity has

798
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,679
and uh everything is like

799
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
transparent and clear and above board

800
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
and if it's done that way then it's i

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,120
think could be extremely useful and it's

802
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
is just what the world needs actually

803
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
because there are serious

804
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
serious as we'll talk about you know

805
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
like overwhelmingly serious problems

806
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
that we face

807
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
i don't know how or if we can solve them

808
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
and if we're not engaging you know

809
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
the scientific world some of the

810
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
brightest minds on the planet if we're

811
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,000
not engaging them

812
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
then you know we're we're not going to

813
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,880
get the kind of solutions that might be

814
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,159
you know i mean we're better off

815
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,600
engaging the science world in these

816
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
questions

817
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,720
along with communities right because

818
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
that

819
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,279
yep i i was talking to you

820
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
no no no it's fun that's fine this okay

821
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,960
yeah yeah

822
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,200
okay just one short on that is it's

823
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
actually a really respectful way for

824
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
science to approach this question

825
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,679
of like we'll be ready as scientists or

826
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,039
as systems thinkers

827
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
or as modelers will come to the table of

828
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,039
policy and

829
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,440
value discussion when we have a

830
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,159
transparent

831
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,559
model that's actually going to be adding

832
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,799
value rather than potentially

833
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,919
being a vector for some non-transparent

834
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,799
force

835
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
to have undue influence on discussions

836
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,480
that really matter

837
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
so it's it's um i hope this conversation

838
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,880
helps people

839
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
rethink how science could be involved in

840
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,840
these policy discussions because those

841
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,039
are going to be the exact terms that

842
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,159
we're going to be

843
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,039
talking through so right right and when

844
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
we talk about the second paper we'll get

845
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,200
more

846
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,039
we'll talk a little bit more about uh

847
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,799
second order science and its role and

848
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,240
there's citations there

849
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,200
for anyone that's that's interested nice

850
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,080
so here we go to

851
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
number six why transform

852
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,720
yeah so uh i mean i i'm guessing that

853
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,200
uh for your audience you know the the

854
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,080
the

855
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,919
your audience probably has a general

856
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,919
sense of things are not

857
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,679
good you know things are not moving in

858
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,159
the right direction and i think maybe

859
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,360
lots of the public has the sense that

860
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,880
things are not good not moving in the

861
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,840
right direction

862
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,760
and climate change is certainly part of

863
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,880
that bio

864
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,519
on the ecological and the ecological

865
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,159
theme

866
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,159
climate change and biodiversity loss are

867
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,279
perhaps

868
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,480
two of the you know

869
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,919
biggest challenges that humanity faces

870
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,440
uh you know now and over the next

871
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,519
say 1 000 years or something

872
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,600
but but our problems go deeper than that

873
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
um

874
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,480
it's it's not just that there's that the

875
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,080
temperature is warming

876
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,679
it's not just the the birds are dying

877
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,159
and the

878
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,679
insects are dying it's that

879
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,080
it it's also has to do with social

880
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,720
issues

881
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,440
poverty for example uh financial

882
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,320
instability

883
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,440
uh uh and all the

884
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
all the social problems that climate

885
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
change and biodiversity loss and other

886
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,559
things are going to

887
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,559
to bring uh uh already with covet i

888
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,279
think there's

889
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,480
there's the the uh split between the

890
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,679
rich and the poor and the world is

891
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,240
getting

892
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,080
even larger than it was and was already

893
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,120
disgustingly large

894
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,600
there's a question of power you know why

895
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,720
do why why does it in a sense if we

896
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
think of money as a voting

897
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,919
tool why is it that a billionaire has a

898
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,799
billion times more power to decide what

899
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,519
society

900
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
should be like than i do you know like

901
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,000
there's questions like that there's just

902
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,720
fairness

903
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,120
questions of fairness there's questions

904
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,799
of decision making who

905
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,960
who how do we make who actually makes

906
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,880
decisions like how

907
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
how many people are in like how much of

908
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,440
the of society is involved when society

909
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
makes a decision you know

910
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,919
there's all these questions uh and all

911
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,200
of them

912
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
can be i think addressed together uh

913
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,360
in a in a r d program like this and

914
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,159
we have to we have to address them i

915
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,200
don't think there is a

916
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,519
there's an option of not transforming

917
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,640
so so voices for transforming for

918
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
some kind of bold transformation are

919
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
getting louder and louder both

920
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,919
in academia and you know at the at the

921
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,039
global scope

922
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,519
global policymakers at the u.n and other

923
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,799
folks like that

924
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,360
uh just within the general public with

925
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,640
even within some

926
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,960
uh you know municipalities city states

927
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
local governments and

928
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,120
and even the national gov governments

929
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,360
there is a rising rising chorus

930
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,440
of voices saying we need to transform

931
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,600
and we need to go big and we need to

932
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,320
change

933
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,000
things you know kind of radically

934
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
somehow so that we can get what we want

935
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,519
in the

936
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,919
you know like so 50 years from now my

937
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,919
children can be enjoying a better world

938
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,720
not a

939
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,840
not a dying world

940
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
now that doesn't mean that i'm going to

941
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,719
jump just a little bit ahead here that

942
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,520
doesn't mean that

943
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,560
everyone thinks that transformation is

944
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,679
necessary but

945
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,359
lots of people don't lots of people

946
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,879
would just as soon keep everything just

947
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,480
the way it is you know or they just

948
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,159
haven't thought about it maybe or

949
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,440
whatever so so i just want to make clear

950
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
that i'm not

951
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,800
you know it's fine people you know

952
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
people can fall wherever they fall

953
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,159
on the spectrum but the paper the end

954
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,879
the r d

955
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,480
program is really aimed at that percent

956
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
of the you know the population and the

957
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,879
science population that is

958
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,679
interested in vole change and it doesn't

959
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,119
really

960
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,320
need the r d program really doesn't need

961
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
the rest of the world to even engage or

962
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,119
pay attention to this

963
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,680
the this whole this the r d program is

964
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
designed to be successful

965
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,440
even if a small slice of the population

966
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,160
participates

967
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,240
so so we you know that was a long story

968
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,400
to say that we face severe social and

969
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,760
ecological risks and

970
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,160
they're getting worse i do want to

971
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,200
mention one more

972
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,160
that kind of second secondary risks that

973
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,520
we will be facing

974
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,960
more of already we have migration forced

975
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
migration problems people fleeing lack

976
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,880
of economic opportunity and fleeing

977
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
violence and things like that

978
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
but you can imagine that that if that's

979
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,000
happening today

980
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
and climate change hasn't really even

981
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,040
hit yet

982
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,280
and biodiversity loss really hasn't even

983
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
hit badly yet

984
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,680
or at least this hasn't hit widespread

985
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,440
badly

986
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,079
where are we going to be in in in 10

987
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,640
years

988
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,160
there's going to be millions i read a

989
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,839
paper and i'm sorry i don't remember the

990
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,560
citation but i read a citation a paper

991
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
that said that um

992
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,599
you know possibly uh a third of the

993
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
global population could be migrants in

994
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,960
the future you know

995
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
in the coming decades i mean that's

996
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,640
billions of people

997
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,200
have to go somewhere and we are not

998
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,839
prepared

999
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,680
at all like in america or really

1000
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
anywhere we're not prepared to absorb

1001
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,079
those people bring them into some kind

1002
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,160
of productive engaged

1003
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,240
society where we're all working together

1004
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,440
and cooperating to

1005
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
you know to to address the needs of

1006
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,480
society

1007
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,760
we're not anywhere near that

1008
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,119
and maybe i'll mention one more too

1009
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,320
because it's one that people don't

1010
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,520
usually think of but

1011
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,720
the even if there's no uh even if

1012
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,240
there's no uh

1013
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,640
uh catastrophe even if things plug along

1014
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,720
as they're going and there's no mass die

1015
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,680
off of humans or anything like that

1016
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
the population is set to decline

1017
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
i don't know when the peak is supposed

1018
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,240
to come but uh

1019
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
the peak is supposed to come at you know

1020
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,920
within the next 10 20 years or so

1021
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,720
and after that the world population will

1022
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,160
start to decline

1023
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,280
how is how is this growth

1024
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,560
capitalism model growth-based capitalism

1025
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
model how is that going to

1026
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
function when the world is shrinking

1027
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,079
you know so there's there's just there's

1028
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,680
there's there's short-term issues

1029
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,160
there's

1030
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,839
long-term issues there there's just

1031
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,680
i would say overwhelming evidence that

1032
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
what we're doing is not sustainable on

1033
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,440
any level and if we don't do something

1034
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,720
it's going to lead to

1035
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,920
to even greater catastrophe

1036
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
i have a few questions one just from the

1037
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,200
chat

1038
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
they wrote the science community here

1039
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,079
seems to be referring to the natural

1040
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,119
rather than the social sciences so it

1041
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,720
seems more like this is about

1042
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,280
stem and technology so maybe where do

1043
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,119
the social sciences fit into this

1044
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,320
oh i i in the in the second paper i give

1045
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,599
a laundry list of

1046
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
fields scientific fields that i that i

1047
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,359
think could really

1048
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,280
contribute to this project and it's

1049
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,760
essentially a to z you know from

1050
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,040
anthropology to uh zoology you know like

1051
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
uh every really every branch not and not

1052
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,920
only every branch of science but

1053
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,280
art uh you know media

1054
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
there's there would be room for every

1055
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,960
you know kind of

1056
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
uh branch of this

1057
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
human endeavor to get involved with this

1058
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,119
thing agriculture

1059
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,320
and psychology and

1060
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
public health and you know

1061
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,839
sociology and all that would just be

1062
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,200
like at the moment you know as i said

1063
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
this is not a funded program

1064
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,560
but i and if it were funded i anticipate

1065
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
that the you know either the

1066
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,839
organization

1067
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,760
would act as a clearing house for for

1068
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
funding uh for

1069
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,640
for you know proposals or or there would

1070
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
be some kind of mechanism set up to

1071
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,480
to distribute funds or or i'm not sure

1072
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,079
exactly how that would work

1073
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,359
but it would be my hope that

1074
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,520
funds are distributed to literally every

1075
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
branch of science and then beyond

1076
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,240
science

1077
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,040
to like i said to art and to literature

1078
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
and to

1079
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,640
you know all of that stuff

1080
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,160
well then let me ask one more question

1081
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,839
on this slide so

1082
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,240
the communities that are likely to

1083
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
institute

1084
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,400
for example the flood prevention some

1085
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,760
sustainable strategy they're going to be

1086
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
in a flood area or they're where the

1087
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
sea levels are changing for example so

1088
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,839
when we think about

1089
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,560
cognitive architectures what kinds of

1090
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,359
individuals or teams or communities or

1091
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,320
systems

1092
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,040
cognitively are like the early canary in

1093
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,079
the coal mine

1094
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,880
that you think are ready to transform or

1095
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
somebody who like might hear something

1096
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,599
about a system they're involved in and

1097
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,200
think actually yeah that sounds like my

1098
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,720
organization or self

1099
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
might be at this sort of transition

1100
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
point right

1101
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,640
um

1102
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,240
there you know if if one looks around

1103
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,280
and

1104
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,359
on the web and elsewhere there are

1105
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,640
numerous uh

1106
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,440
kind of experiments going on in in a

1107
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
variety of things in the

1108
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,640
and new forms of representative

1109
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,920
democracy

1110
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,040
new forms of decision making

1111
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,160
new forms of economies in the sense of

1112
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,400
you know local digital currencies and

1113
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,520
things like that

1114
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,400
i think all of those you know all of

1115
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,359
those are

1116
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,078
are excellent um

1117
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,040
you know a resource to draw from

1118
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,240
uh of the the task is then is to

1119
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,960
take these ideas these ideas that are

1120
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,400
springing up all over

1121
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,839
and put integrate them in a way

1122
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,040
that is functional you know

1123
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,000
can serve a community initially maybe

1124
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
the community is small just a few

1125
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,079
thousand but

1126
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,680
the idea is that it would that it would

1127
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,400
grow over time exponentially grow to who

1128
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,839
knows you know hundreds of thousands

1129
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,760
millions i don't know

1130
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,520
so how can you take all those ideas and

1131
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,160
actually make them work

1132
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,079
sometimes i i liken it to you know that

1133
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,160
you might tinker in the garage with a

1134
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,680
with an airplane you know you might

1135
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,599
build a two-seater in the garage and

1136
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,359
that's totally cool you know you can

1137
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,560
you know that maybe what the wright

1138
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
brothers did or something that's

1139
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
fantastic

1140
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,880
but i'm really interested in building a

1141
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,920
jumbo jet that takes you know 500

1142
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,839
passengers at a time in an hour and a

1143
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,480
half to

1144
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,079
from new york to london or whatever and

1145
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,000
doesn't fall in the ocean you know

1146
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,240
like so how do you do that how do you

1147
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,880
how do you build a

1148
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,680
integrated system that is safe that is

1149
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,720
resilient

1150
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,880
that is that it that has metrics that

1151
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
you can monitor

1152
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,760
progress that has good anticipation so

1153
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,480
you know

1154
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
where the you know that where you're

1155
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
going tomorrow you know where this

1156
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,599
where is this going you know what's

1157
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,280
going to happen tomorrow and

1158
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,640
sort of what's going to happen to me you

1159
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
know that's that's part of the question

1160
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,000
so uh so the so i think the challenge is

1161
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,520
to take all these ideas that are

1162
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
that are popping up all over which some

1163
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,119
really great ideas

1164
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,680
and then to integrate them into uh into

1165
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,359
a coherent hole

1166
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,240
that that spans every one of the i think

1167
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,359
maybe is it six

1168
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,480
systems that i talk about so that so

1169
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
that they're not

1170
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,520
designed in silos we're not just

1171
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,280
building the new economic system we're

1172
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
not just building a

1173
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
new educational system we're building

1174
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
this we're building a

1175
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,319
a cognitive architecture that includes

1176
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,440
all of those okay awesome response

1177
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,240
awesome response

1178
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,839
all right well we're you know we're

1179
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,520
moving slow here it's totally fine but

1180
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,079
uh

1181
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,359
uh uh so uh on this slide

1182
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,400
uh this is again again is the topic of

1183
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,000
why transform and we only got

1184
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,280
the first paragraph so far

1185
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,040
oh oh nice okay we will stay on six oh

1186
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,119
you know we and we gotta we got a ways

1187
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,319
to go on six

1188
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,280
we can uh we can continue on you you can

1189
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,960
just summarize in one sentence

1190
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,160
or um however you want to do it but

1191
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,040
up to you okay all right i'll try to go

1192
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,119
a little quick through the rest

1193
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,119
most of that discussion on is on

1194
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,960
humanity faces severe social and

1195
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,160
ecological risks

1196
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,000
the next one is our systems are

1197
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,359
dysfunctional as

1198
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,240
is and i would say that is evidenced by

1199
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
the fact that we

1200
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,599
are under extreme threat like you know

1201
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,800
what kind of sensible uh healthy

1202
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,200
person puts themselves on a ledge

1203
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,960
hanging by their fingertips i mean like

1204
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,440
that's

1205
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,359
not something's wrong you know like you

1206
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,280
don't do that

1207
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,440
a a competent a cognitively competent

1208
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
society does not push itself to

1209
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,560
what is could literally be the

1210
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,599
the early stage extinction

1211
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,440
you know that's there's something deeply

1212
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,359
wrong deeply dysfunctional

1213
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,319
that we find ourselves in the situation

1214
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,079
that we're now in

1215
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,240
and we can do far better and we must do

1216
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,680
far better obviously if we're going to

1217
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,200
thrive and survive

1218
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,520
and not only that but as we talk about

1219
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
purpose we

1220
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,000
we actually long we it would make us

1221
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
deeply deeply

1222
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,800
happy to do better to be to solve

1223
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
problems to be more engaged with a

1224
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,160
healthy society to

1225
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,400
to really feel like there's a deep

1226
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,839
cooperation happening

1227
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,800
in society that would you know our

1228
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,920
hearts would burst

1229
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,359
you know of of uh of joy sort of

1230
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,359
we would be we would be happier if we

1231
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,440
were a part of a society like that

1232
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,560
it's very stressful we were designed by

1233
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:54,880
you know

1234
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,359
evolution through evolution we have

1235
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,000
become

1236
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,280
we were i really every organism as we'll

1237
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,640
talk about in a minute is a

1238
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,160
problem-solving organism

1239
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,920
and if i can't solve problems there's

1240
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,200
like a you know

1241
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,040
like fundamentally going against the

1242
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,920
grain of what it means to be an organism

1243
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,240
okay nice good

1244
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,960
shall we go on to the next one you can

1245
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,160
go to the third part or do you want to

1246
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,880
go to slide seven

1247
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,240
uh what is the third part well it was

1248
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
kind of the i think that was about it

1249
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,440
let's go to slide seven so john

1250
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,920
what is this series

1251
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,000
[Laughter]

1252
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,119
well i'm glad you asked oh i have a

1253
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,839
script don't worry

1254
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,160
so as i mentioned everybody the series

1255
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,960
really is a is a proposal for an rd r d

1256
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,000
program aimed at

1257
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,040
as new de novo development of new

1258
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,240
societal systems

1259
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,079
and it's also a way to context and a way

1260
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,359
to think about what

1261
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,359
transformation might mean so uh

1262
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
it is it is a long-term project you know

1263
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,440
like a 50-year

1264
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
project this isn't we're not it would be

1265
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,280
dangerous to change society radically

1266
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,400
overnight

1267
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
so this is a long-term project for

1268
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,319
long-term benefit

1269
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,720
and then early communities that become

1270
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,319
that become involved early in that

1271
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,839
process would of course

1272
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,440
see benefits quite early um

1273
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,480
and there are i already mentioned that

1274
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,280
we cover six

1275
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,359
primary societal systems so that's the

1276
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,119
cognitive architecture

1277
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,000
once again they are economic governance

1278
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,800
legal

1279
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,839
public health and what i call analytical

1280
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
forecasting and education

1281
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,680
and you know any one of those can be

1282
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
broken down further like economic really

1283
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:47,760
me

1284
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,079
and also includes a monetary system and

1285
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,760
the financial system and things like

1286
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,880
that

1287
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,000
uh so six primary societal systems the

1288
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,040
idea is to out of all conceivable

1289
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,319
designs what might work best

1290
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,319
uh the the whole project is based on

1291
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,400
three underlying propositions the the

1292
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,359
papers are and the project

1293
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,359
first is that uh a society of any scale

1294
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:15,599
and

1295
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
and i don't mean society is in bill

1296
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
millions or billions of people i mean

1297
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,079
society as

1298
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,599
in a thousand people you know like a sub

1299
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,880
sub city a community that is not even a

1300
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,319
whole city just a

1301
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,520
a group of like-minded people uh

1302
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,000
who are willing to give this a give this

1303
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,680
you know

1304
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,000
a field trial ago a society of any scale

1305
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
can be viewed as a super organism

1306
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
so that's kind of fundamental everything

1307
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,640
really really works from there

1308
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,839
we are together we

1309
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,440
are not just individuals connected we

1310
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,440
are a whole society is a whole

1311
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,720
and it's a and it's a whole with the

1312
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,440
environment and it's wider you know

1313
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,559
sphere

1314
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,960
so as we'll talk about today you know

1315
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,280
this even the idea of an individual

1316
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,319
is it's okay to talk about individuals

1317
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,440
it's fine but it's

1318
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,839
kind of like an arbitrary thing an

1319
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,520
individual could be an individual

1320
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
cell or an individual person or an

1321
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,880
individual

1322
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
uh species or an individual ecosystem

1323
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,440
but it's all with all

1324
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,480
deeply embedded and enmeshed

1325
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,800
entwined with the whole

1326
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,240
so uh uh a society can be viewed as a

1327
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
super organism

1328
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,240
uh uh society's complete set of systems

1329
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,920
as we've already said the six

1330
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,079
six big systems i've mentioned can be

1331
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,839
viewed as a cognitive architecture it's

1332
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,160
the

1333
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,640
it's the means by which the society

1334
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,520
learns

1335
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,559
decides adapts and

1336
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,440
and this society's efforts this is the

1337
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,359
third underlying position the society's

1338
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,680
efforts to learn decide and adapt

1339
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,400
and be viewed as being driven by an

1340
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,920
intrinsic purpose

1341
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,960
and that's really key also

1342
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,119
because it's not just that we're

1343
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,880
learning deciding and adapting

1344
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,800
willy-nilly i mean i mean maybe it seems

1345
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,079
that way in the world you know in the

1346
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:16,800
sense

1347
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,319
we're so dysfunctional it kind of is

1348
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,400
billy nilly but

1349
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,240
but what really matters is that we

1350
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,599
learn decide and adapt in relation to

1351
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,640
whatever intrinsic purpose we actually

1352
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,040
have

1353
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,079
as as a society as individuals in a

1354
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,280
society

1355
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,640
it's that it's it's it's it's as i will

1356
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
use the the term uh maybe several times

1357
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,079
today it's

1358
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,480
solving problems that matter that really

1359
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,200
that really

1360
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,240
matter that's what we're after

1361
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,640
cool well on this uh super organism

1362
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,960
point as someone who

1363
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,760
studied ants and um still studies the eu

1364
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,200
social insects

1365
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,040
this kind of multi-scale thinking is

1366
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,280
really fun it's just always such an

1367
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,920
interesting question what level does

1368
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,559
purpose

1369
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,599
exist at so is it that purpose exists at

1370
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,800
every level

1371
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,240
like the cell the nest mate the colony

1372
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,280
the colony and its symbiont and its

1373
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,480
predator prey

1374
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,599
and the microbes and the niche and then

1375
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
where you draw the sort of qualia like

1376
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,160
philosophy lines it's it's

1377
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,839
it's a whole debate it's a whole thing

1378
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,240
yeah it is it it is it's

1379
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,559
rich it's a whole it is rich but then

1380
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,960
also there's the systems

1381
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,319
kind of systems mapping approach that

1382
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,280
albeit coldly does sidestep those

1383
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,400
questions

1384
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,520
and i think part of the humanism

1385
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,640
is about how to bring these multi-scale

1386
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,520
questions and multi-scale perspectives

1387
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,359
which are basically neutral

1388
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,520
tools because one's preference vector

1389
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,040
and active inference could be to lose

1390
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,839
money

1391
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,800
i mean then i guess you know good job

1392
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,760
but

1393
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,440
we have to have the preference vector

1394
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,040
and then what will be interesting to

1395
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,880
draw out i think in these discussions

1396
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,480
will be just like you said with the

1397
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,640
transparency of the values

1398
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
what does it look like to actually

1399
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,079
specify

1400
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,079
values within a model based framework

1401
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,559
and take the bold step from just like i

1402
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,680
trust my models and

1403
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,960
i'm a fan of liberty to i trust my model

1404
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,400
about liberty

1405
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,520
and i'm willing to let that model

1406
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,200
drive for a little bit with respect to

1407
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,280
my decisions so that's really like such

1408
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,319
an interesting

1409
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,480
handoff and that's also new and related

1410
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,599
to technology

1411
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,040
that's evolving so like you're bringing

1412
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,960
a lot of ideas together

1413
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
i hope people are you know listening to

1414
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,839
it and finding it exciting

1415
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,119
enable just jump ahead a little bit here

1416
00:51:59,119 --> 00:51:59,520
is

1417
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,960
as far as a preference vector

1418
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,960
i i took pains not to put a

1419
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,520
not to suggest a preference vector of

1420
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,400
any kind in

1421
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,119
this series this wasn't it wouldn't be

1422
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,400
very useful

1423
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,000
for me to do that for one thing but but

1424
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,880
but for those listeners who are active

1425
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,760
inference fans

1426
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,839
you know having only a

1427
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,359
preference vector is uh is or

1428
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,000
maybe i should say having a having a

1429
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,680
checkoff list like you know

1430
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,079
there should be this level of education

1431
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,520
there should be

1432
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,890
this level of

1433
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,440
[Music]

1434
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,160
health people should live this long and

1435
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,280
so we have our

1436
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,400
fitness and we're gonna uh we've decided

1437
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,119
in advance

1438
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,440
even before the system is running we've

1439
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,040
now have a list of things we're gonna

1440
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,640
check off we're gonna score each one

1441
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,920
we're gonna come up with some kind of

1442
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,000
integrated fitness score from that

1443
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,599
and that's how we're going to move

1444
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,440
forward we're always going to refer to

1445
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,000
this fit

1446
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,359
this you know this fitness model and

1447
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,760
the fitness vector and these and these

1448
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,480
kind of hard-coded

1449
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,440
values for what's good and what's bad so

1450
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,839
so

1451
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,760
in the world of artificial intelligence

1452
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,280
and in the world of active inference you

1453
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,839
know that

1454
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,599
really doesn't go very far that doesn't

1455
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,319
work that doesn't work very well

1456
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,160
because what happens is we didn't you

1457
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,640
didn't think ahead you like you some

1458
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,800
something happens tomorrow and whoever

1459
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,240
came up with that list of

1460
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,359
uh you know those values or that model

1461
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,200
didn't really include the fact that

1462
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
maybe

1463
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,839
spaceships from mars were gonna land and

1464
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:42,880
cause a new

1465
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,240
disruption and then we have to deal with

1466
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,839
that problem now too before we deal with

1467
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,800
anything else

1468
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,559
so that wasn't in the you know that

1469
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,559
wasn't in the plan and now what do we do

1470
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,520
you know

1471
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,640
so there's right so so

1472
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
this is you know this is really where

1473
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,000
active inference plays into

1474
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,440
that's one way that active inference

1475
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,040
plays into this is

1476
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,400
how do you evaluate

1477
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,760
and act in a world that is

1478
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,800
full of uncertainties right

1479
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,920
the unknown unknown the unknown unknown

1480
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,520
is the temperature dynamics but

1481
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,280
you know it's going to be temperature

1482
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,440
and so how can you plan

1483
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,839
for what you know it will be in a

1484
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,520
distributional sense

1485
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,400
right and make stabilization on that

1486
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,440
awesome right right so

1487
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,680
so yeah so you so you realize you know

1488
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
already you realize maybe that this is

1489
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,359
not a proposal to build a

1490
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,200
say like a model of uh of uh you know

1491
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,480
like how

1492
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,640
society makes decisions you know that's

1493
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,160
that's not that's not

1494
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,880
it it is what is the process

1495
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,319
by which society cognates

1496
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,000
and you know what kind of what kind of

1497
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,920
infrastructure and tools and

1498
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,559
and and you know mechanics can we use

1499
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,559
that would facilitate that

1500
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,599
but it's not to build a thing

1501
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,480
it's to build it's to realize that we

1502
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,760
are

1503
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,559
in we are engaged moment to moment in a

1504
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,000
cognitive process

1505
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,440
society as individuals are and how can

1506
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,079
we

1507
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,000
do that together as a society so that

1508
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,280
we're you know we we balance exploration

1509
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,599
with

1510
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,720
exploitation um you know so that we we

1511
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,200
learn

1512
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,119
about our environment we grow we learn

1513
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,799
we explore we

1514
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,960
we make good decisions based on

1515
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,799
available evidence and

1516
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,480
based on knowledge based on cultural

1517
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,400
knowledge you know like all those things

1518
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,520
right so so this is a this is

1519
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,839
the the the you know

1520
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,480
i think organisms are a process they're

1521
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,960
not a thing anyway right

1522
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,079
cognition is a process and

1523
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,160
societal decision making is a process

1524
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,000
and really society is a process

1525
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you know there's there's not too many

1526
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,680
things in this world there's mostly

1527
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,799
processes

1528
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,319
living processes intelligent processes

1529
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,839
so that's that's the that's the hope

1530
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,599
that's where this is trying to go is to

1531
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,200
like with that in mind

1532
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,599
with that with that broad understanding

1533
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,200
or broad concept in mind

1534
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,640
how do we uh how do we

1535
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,079
think about you know how we how we come

1536
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,079
together as society how we cooperate how

1537
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:22,720
we

1538
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,119
coordinate how we make decisions how we

1539
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,119
how we learn how we explore

1540
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,359
what do we what do we monitor what kind

1541
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,359
of information do we seek

1542
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,040
you know what kind of experiments do we

1543
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,040
do all that kind of stuff

1544
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,599
great do you want to go to that seeks

1545
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,119
answers to two questions or

1546
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,680
yeah yeah that's the last one on this on

1547
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,280
the slide is uh

1548
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,319
so so the two questions that we

1549
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,599
hopefully would

1550
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,720
uh try to answer with with this r d

1551
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,280
program

1552
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,200
is and and one of this i already

1553
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,960
mentioned but out of all conceivable

1554
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,040
designs for societal systems so

1555
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,079
so so this isn't about capitalism versus

1556
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,839
socialism or something like that there's

1557
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,119
like i would think there's an unlimited

1558
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,000
potential we're creative we're creative

1559
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,200
people

1560
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,280
there would be a million varieties of

1561
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,119
of societal systems and integrated

1562
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,799
societal systems that we might come up

1563
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,760
with

1564
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,040
and some of those probably would work

1565
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,319
very well and some of them probably

1566
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,079
would work very poorly

1567
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,040
um so among those what what might be

1568
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,799
among the best and not the the single

1569
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,319
best that's not the purpose either it's

1570
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,400
not just to find one thing that works is

1571
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,319
to find like a

1572
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,839
you know more of a a variety a process

1573
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,200
of things a

1574
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,520
mix mishmash of things that community

1575
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,640
the communities

1576
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,680
can choose to implement that you know

1577
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,359
works well for them and that suits them

1578
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,799
and that works well for their neighbors

1579
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,319
and works well forever it works well for

1580
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,799
the whole really

1581
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,400
uh second question is uh by

1582
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,119
what and this is as of course the the

1583
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,319
kicker is

1584
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,960
not only what systems might be best but

1585
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,200
what how would you possibly

1586
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,920
uh implement them what viable way is

1587
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,880
there

1588
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,359
to implement new system designs you know

1589
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,720
like otherwise what's the purpose you

1590
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,359
know this isn't

1591
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,599
this isn't an academic this isn't just

1592
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,280
an academic uh you know

1593
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,280
excursion this is like let's change the

1594
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,480
world

1595
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,040
and that has to be practical in some you

1596
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
know in some has to be viable

1597
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,760
so those are the two questions what what

1598
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,599
what might be best and how do we get

1599
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,720
there awesome well it really does

1600
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,839
i think read like you've turned it over

1601
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:34,559
a lot and

1602
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,400
communicated with a lot of people about

1603
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,480
it

1604
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,760
so yeah we can go to eight should we go

1605
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,480
to the next one

1606
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,079
yep slide eight okay so

1607
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,280
so let's suppose let's suppose your

1608
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,720
listeners are with me and

1609
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,280
you know we kind of agree like okay yes

1610
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,119
transformation's necessary

1611
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,240
and uh again i want to emphasize i'm not

1612
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,920
talking about reform i'm not talking

1613
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,160
about a softer better capitalism i'm not

1614
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,920
talking about

1615
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,280
you know improved voter registration or

1616
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,119
like any of those things i'm talking

1617
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,640
about de novo

1618
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,520
starting over from scratch what might be

1619
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,200
best and if it turns out that the old

1620
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,040
systems were better than anything

1621
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,880
that humanity can come up with well then

1622
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,400
you know that's the answer but

1623
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,240
i can't imagine that's true because the

1624
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,240
old systems were never designed in any

1625
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,440
kind of

1626
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,520
you know thoughtful science driven

1627
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,720
[Music]

1628
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,680
you know process to to to test to

1629
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,440
explore and to come up with

1630
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,040
fitness like what is the you know we

1631
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,240
don't even have a fitness for our

1632
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,520
current society

1633
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,760
much less of fitness for societal

1634
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,200
designs

1635
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,839
i mean we have the gdp but that's a

1636
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,720
terrible terrible

1637
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,440
limited fitness metric

1638
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,760
okay so suppose you're with me suppose

1639
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,559
we're

1640
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,359
we're on board we we want to do this de

1641
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,880
novo design thing

1642
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,520
where do we start what's the what's what

1643
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,040
where do we even get off the

1644
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,839
ground on this and i suggest that the

1645
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,200
way to do it

1646
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,079
is through first address worldview

1647
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,160
from world view once we understand what

1648
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,440
the world view is

1649
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,400
what a reasonable useful world view will

1650
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,280
be

1651
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,799
for this project then then purpose

1652
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,480
derives worldview begets purpose once

1653
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,240
you understand what it is you want

1654
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,559
what you value what do you value once

1655
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,240
you understand what you value

1656
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,839
then you can say well i value a

1657
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,839
and therefore the purpose is to

1658
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,960
have a manifest in society

1659
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,720
for example so

1660
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,599
once you have purpose then you can think

1661
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,040
about what metrics

1662
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,280
how would you measure whether are you so

1663
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,720
here's a new design is it fit for

1664
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,200
purpose

1665
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,880
does it do does it fulfill its purpose

1666
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,000
you know that's the question and then

1667
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,760
metrics go with some kind of fitness

1668
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,520
evaluation

1669
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,640
and then finally last of all of those

1670
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,960
would be the design okay we know what we

1671
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,319
know what we value

1672
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,839
we know what this thing is supposed to

1673
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,359
do we know what the purpose is we know

1674
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,960
that attractor is supposed to

1675
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,799
you know plow the ground or something we

1676
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,799
know what this is supposed to do

1677
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,720
we know how to measure success and uh

1678
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,319
now finally then let's talk about design

1679
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,359
what are the what are the

1680
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,440
you know the specifics and mechanics and

1681
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,599
how does that happen

1682
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,359
and the the series is really kind of

1683
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,520
laid out this way the first paper really

1684
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,839
talks about world view and purpose the

1685
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:40,640
second paper

1686
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,880
talks about the you know the more the

1687
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,640
mechanics of things

1688
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,240
like viability how would you make this

1689
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,920
thing viable things like that

1690
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
and then the very last paper that's

1691
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,440
titled the subtitle design

1692
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,720
okay so uh that's how we uh and

1693
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,319
and maybe i will just mention here that

1694
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,400
i put metrics before design

1695
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,440
because we might have some ideas

1696
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,960
uh getting back to that preference

1697
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,480
factor we might have some ideas like we

1698
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,240
would like people not to die at

1699
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,160
30 you know we'd like people to mostly

1700
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,000
live to a ripe old age

1701
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,280
and have you know enough water water to

1702
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,480
drink and food to eat and all that kind

1703
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,280
of stuff

1704
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,160
so uh you know what kind of design once

1705
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,599
now that we have metrics to measure that

1706
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,160
kind of stuff

1707
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,960
longevity and nutrition and things what

1708
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,559
kind of designs would help us to reach

1709
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,520
those targets

1710
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,119
you know so that's one reason why design

1711
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,400
why metrics comes before design

1712
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,200
okay so uh now we can start to jump into

1713
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,599
the

1714
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,760
you know now we jump into this topic of

1715
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,599
world view the very first one

1716
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,720
world view and purpose

1717
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,760
and uh um you know i think we're on page

1718
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
10 maybe of the first paper so far

1719
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,520
we've still got a long ways to go

1720
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,280
nice uh okay so um

1721
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,319
so what what i've tried to do in in

1722
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,000
in you know the main theme of this first

1723
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,240
paper is i've tried to lay out

1724
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,160
a world view that is cognizant of that

1725
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,520
reflects

1726
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,559
some of the latest developments

1727
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,119
in in science and in a variety of fields

1728
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,000
and sciences

1729
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,640
in those fields would be like complex

1730
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,598
system science

1731
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,839
cognitive science evolutionary biology

1732
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:32,319
uh in a you know a few fields like that

1733
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,920
information theory and a few things like

1734
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,160
that

1735
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,520
i i've tried to to outline

1736
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,640
a a a world view that makes sense

1737
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,440
from that leading edge of science and i

1738
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,480
would say too that

1739
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,079
that science has gone through really

1740
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,520
kind of a revolution you know there was

1741
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:49,920
like

1742
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,119
it's kind of like there's the pre-1950s

1743
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,400
60s science and then there's

1744
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,440
what we have today and there's enormous

1745
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,280
jumps enormous leaps in understanding

1746
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,559
that have happened

1747
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,359
just in the last say 50 years or so and

1748
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:07,680
and

1749
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,599
and some of those leaps the

1750
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:10,720
ramifications

1751
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,200
are only now being you know the they're

1752
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:13,760
now

1753
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,280
being felt right the the the the

1754
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,400
some of the concepts are a a distinct

1755
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:20,960
shift

1756
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,119
from where we were in the you know the

1757
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:28,160
pre-1960s or pre-1970s or so

1758
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,480
and um obviously we there's also

1759
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,880
you know we we see the changes in our

1760
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,160
lifetime you know

1761
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,359
like we i was watching an old show on tv

1762
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,880
the other day and somebody put money in

1763
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,160
a pay phone you know like they put a

1764
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,280
quarter and a pay phone to make

1765
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,799
telephone call and it's like okay well

1766
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,760
that's

1767
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,160
that's that's that's history you know so

1768
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,839
there's all these technologies that have

1769
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,760
that are that are that i grew up with

1770
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,359
that are not they don't even exist

1771
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,280
anymore they've been replaced by

1772
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,799
entirely new frameworks and that's

1773
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,880
the speed of those of the speed of that

1774
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,000
evolution is

1775
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,559
is exponential so it's tremendous

1776
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,720
changes happening very quickly and the

1777
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,079
task of the program

1778
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,240
oh yeah which one put on that would be

1779
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,920
um potentially because you're taking

1780
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,760
such a broad perspective with complex

1781
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,039
system science and

1782
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,359
evolutionary bio you might say that

1783
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,680
society has always been a cognitive

1784
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,119
architecture but if you had asked in

1785
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,079
1500 is society a cognitive architecture

1786
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,520
be like well no i mean you have

1787
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
agriculture you have this you have this

1788
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,520
you have that whereas now if you tell

1789
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,160
people

1790
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,880
hey telecoms are they run through

1791
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,160
everything and the internet of

1792
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,319
things the internet people you know like

1793
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:41,359
all this sort of stuff

1794
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,799
you tell people actually it's a

1795
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,119
multi-scale cognitive architecture

1796
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,880
humans are in the loop and our

1797
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,480
algorithms are never independent from us

1798
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,160
they're in feedback with us it's like

1799
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,640
yeah that was what the mainstream was

1800
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,440
telling me

1801
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,480
so actually it's a total alignment point

1802
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,280
because it reflects how rapidly things

1803
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,400
are changing that it's just

1804
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,160
undeniably obvious that the

1805
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,000
communication infrastructure is

1806
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,640
the system that we're engineering right

1807
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,760
right absolutely

1808
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,559
yeah yeah communications have

1809
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,640
mind-blowing changes and communications

1810
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:12,880
and

1811
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,640
and that brings mind-blowing changes and

1812
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,960
outlook but but i want to emphasize a

1813
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,599
few

1814
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,319
points to this worldview that that you

1815
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,920
know it's not

1816
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,200
it's not just that everything is

1817
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,559
connected like you know you go like i

1818
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,000
know what a complex system is it just

1819
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,440
means everything is connected and we're

1820
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,319
all kind of whole

1821
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,000
and blah blah okay fine but but

1822
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,960
even for people who are in that ilk you

1823
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,240
know who understand the

1824
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,000
the basic concept there there's ideas

1825
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,160
that are that have come out in the last

1826
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,760
decade or so

1827
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,079
that that are there that are even

1828
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,359
pushing that boundary

1829
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,880
you know right and and i just want to

1830
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,359
highlight a few concepts here

1831
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,960
and i think active inference really is

1832
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,400
playing a you know is

1833
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,720
is like a in a sense a culmination of

1834
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,640
some of some of these ideas

1835
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,480
or an embodiment of some of these ideas

1836
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,119
the main thing i want to say is that

1837
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,480
life is intelligent

1838
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,039
and whole so it's not just that

1839
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,240
everything's connected

1840
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,960
it's that everything is intelligent

1841
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,599
everything

1842
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,359
is a lot you know life is

1843
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,400
an intelligent information processing

1844
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,680
thing everything

1845
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,039
is is is adapting

1846
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,119
learning deciding whether we're talking

1847
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,359
about everything is cognitive

1848
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,520
you know and cognition really implies

1849
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,880
information

1850
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,680
and information processing so whether

1851
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,720
we're talking about a

1852
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,079
slime mold or a human you know there's

1853
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,640
there's in in everything in plants in

1854
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,599
bacteria

1855
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,559
in mold and anything that has any life

1856
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:51,359
at all

1857
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,520
that can be considered alive is

1858
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,400
intelligent

1859
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,440
and is learning and reacting not just

1860
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,880
reacting but learning

1861
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,000
reacting and also deciding and acting

1862
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,319
and remembering and all those things and

1863
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,200
you might ask well

1864
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,078
you know that's impossible

1865
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,640
bacteria doesn't have a brain you know

1866
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,839
it can't be

1867
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,160
it can't be cognitive but it is

1868
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,039
cognitive

1869
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,319
but we just have to relax what we how we

1870
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,679
define cognition you know

1871
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,040
and when on the slide i have

1872
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,439
a little thing there that every organism

1873
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,799
is cognitive in the sense that it

1874
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,198
displays capacities typically associated

1875
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,640
with human cognition

1876
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,439
such as sensing learning problem solving

1877
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,120
memory storage and recall

1878
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,399
anticipation anticipations is key to

1879
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,238
everything and attention is key to

1880
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,158
everything

1881
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,040
so every organism does that plants and

1882
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,759
everything else

1883
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,719
and it doesn't require a central nervous

1884
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,120
system

1885
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,640
and and you i might add to this that not

1886
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,040
only is every organism cognitive but

1887
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,799
essentially every organism

1888
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,759
organism is cooperative to those

1889
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,679
cooperation and cognition

1890
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,439
go hand in hand because any intelligent

1891
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,399
organism

1892
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,120
any organism that can act to better its

1893
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,479
you know viability is going to cooperate

1894
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,198
in

1895
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,560
meaningful ways with other organisms and

1896
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,000
you know other species and things like

1897
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,759
that nice

1898
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,000
point because um there's cost to

1899
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,040
communication

1900
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,040
whether it's exactly whether it's the

1901
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,560
cost of making the pheromone

1902
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,640
or just the time which is super finite

1903
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,640
or attention fundamentally

1904
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,759
and so costly interactions through time

1905
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,158
the game theory are either to exploit

1906
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,560
and stabilize which is fragile

1907
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,600
or to succeed together yeah

1908
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,238
exactly and and and succeeding together

1909
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,040
cooperation

1910
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,960
is is is like everywhere once you

1911
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,320
once you understand what you're looking

1912
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,960
for it's in the biologic world it's like

1913
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,640
everywhere so this idea that we're

1914
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,080
you know one one one person against all

1915
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,520
or you know we're a

1916
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,320
dog eat dog universe i mean it's you

1917
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,760
know in a certain sense it's true

1918
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,360
obviously tigers eat

1919
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,320
you know whatever they eat zebras or

1920
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,040
whatever

1921
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,000
i mean that happens yes of course but in

1922
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,520
the larger picture

1923
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,920
over and over multiple time scales not

1924
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,560
just uh

1925
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,080
you know in five minutes but over

1926
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,840
evolutionary time scales and

1927
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,159
uh you know developmental time scales

1928
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,080
and everything

1929
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,199
the cooperation is really the rule

1930
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,159
for the most part and if you need if any

1931
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,320
listener needs proof of that

1932
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,960
just think of who you think of your body

1933
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,679
i mean

1934
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,600
there's about a trillion some trillion

1935
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,920
some cells

1936
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,159
that are enormously harmonious like

1937
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,480
your blood pumps every day or you know

1938
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,880
this is a this is like a miracle

1939
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,480
i don't want to use the word miracle

1940
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,520
because i want to get into

1941
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,239
whatever that might imply but uh it is

1942
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,280
amazing

1943
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,560
aw inspiring the

1944
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,280
the depth of cooperation just in our own

1945
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:09,840
bodies

1946
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,960
is like that's that's like

1947
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,920
evolution must prefer cooperation or

1948
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,560
else

1949
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,600
there would never be such a complex

1950
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,920
uh pattern of cooperation as we see just

1951
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,719
in one human body

1952
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,960
just to give one example from the bees

1953
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,040
so from a species i study

1954
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,120
it's almost like a sparring type of

1955
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,719
cooperation because

1956
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,159
when it was discovered that there were

1957
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,880
some workers with developed ovaries

1958
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,560
there was a whole story about cheating

1959
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,960
and policing and about altruism and

1960
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,320
this equation says this and that

1961
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
equation says that and then when you

1962
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,520
take a step back

1963
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,440
it's like the colony having a

1964
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,920
distribution of over-reactivation

1965
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,040
may be more ecologically resilient so

1966
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,080
um i as an evolutionary biologist

1967
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,120
never think well my interpretation of

1968
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:01,520
what

1969
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,600
would be lovey-dovey in this system must

1970
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,199
be how it works because that's so

1971
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,640
clearly not true

1972
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,320
it's just to say that there are

1973
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,239
interesting dynamics within and between

1974
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,960
levels

1975
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,080
and in the long run cooperation and

1976
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,719
stable

1977
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,520
cooperation and like learning to adapt

1978
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,000
to

1979
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,360
your niche is a winning strategy

1980
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,920
in a way that locking down just isn't

1981
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,320
but unfortunately

1982
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,360
under high um stress and

1983
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,840
uh high uncertainty conditions simple

1984
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,760
strategies can become rife

1985
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,440
so that's sort of a failure mode of the

1986
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,760
population yeah that's what i understand

1987
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,400
also like

1988
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,679
you know what you're saying yeah

1989
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,640
no it's uh nice if a if a species can

1990
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
avoid

1991
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,080
highly stressful situations because

1992
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,440
that's

1993
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,199
often things don't go well once you get

1994
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,480
to that point you know things can go

1995
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,560
awry

1996
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,800
um

1997
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,960
what's that do you want to go to nine or

1998
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,760
stay on eight oh um

1999
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,280
uh yeah i think let's go to nine let's

2000
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,520
move ahead perfect what is an individual

2001
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,880
okay so why why the why in the world

2002
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,679
would i

2003
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,360
why would we ask this question and why

2004
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,120
would i spend you know

2005
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,239
multiple pages in this paper even

2006
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,800
discussing like of course we know what

2007
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
an individual is right

2008
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,239
or or maybe not like like that actually

2009
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,840
turns out to be a difficult question

2010
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,520
what is an individual

2011
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
and it's important to this and it's

2012
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,280
important to this discussion of societal

2013
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,159
systems because

2014
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,520
who are we who what you know what is the

2015
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,480
purpose of

2016
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,560
a societal system what is it what is it

2017
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,800
who is it supposed to serve

2018
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,600
you know so you have to ask really like

2019
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,080
it's

2020
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,360
it's good to ask if we're going to build

2021
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,880
a societal system

2022
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,440
who wh who is it that it's supposed to

2023
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,320
service you know like who are we

2024
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,840
what do we want you know it's part of

2025
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,360
figuring out what do we want what do we

2026
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,960
value who are we

2027
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,159
start there you know i would say

2028
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,280
so so we've already kind of touched on

2029
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,120
these themes but

2030
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,520
this idea of rugged individualism you

2031
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,520
know like from a certain perspective and

2032
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,159
a certain

2033
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,239
you know from a limited sort of time

2034
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,360
frame perspective

2035
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,120
sure there's there's a rugged

2036
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,400
individualism that

2037
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,800
exists right and it can be useful in

2038
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,400
certain

2039
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,960
certain situations but by and large

2040
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,640
that's not what life is doing you know

2041
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,840
that's not what

2042
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,040
the the they're

2043
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,640
um we are we are

2044
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,199
it's really even difficult to say like

2045
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,199
where if i'm a rugged individual

2046
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,000
where do i actually start and where do i

2047
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,199
end you know like where

2048
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,199
is where is me this you know even

2049
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,800
physically it's hard to say

2050
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,080
because this physical me is really

2051
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,400
i think more bacterial cells than it is

2052
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,800
um human cells right so

2053
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,159
so uh like i'm a sieve i'm a

2054
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,719
i'm a process through which things are

2055
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:03,360
flowing

2056
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,080
through i'm a i'm an ecosystem myself

2057
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,080
with bacteria and viruses

2058
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,560
and human cells and all of those

2059
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
components are necessary

2060
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,880
for me to survive today and for for

2061
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,560
humans to survive

2062
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,840
you know over eons were

2063
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,800
like a mix we're a bag of of human-like

2064
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,719
things and bacterial-like things and

2065
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,560
viral-like things and

2066
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,440
and we're porous and we're part of the

2067
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,800
carbon cycle and we're part of the

2068
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,560
nitrogen cycle and then you and then

2069
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,400
when you say like okay well

2070
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,320
how could you be a rugged individual

2071
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,640
individual when you're really

2072
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,120
this this porous smorgasbord of things

2073
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,560
right so so the there was an interesting

2074
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,080
paper that came out

2075
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,719
i cited in the in my in my in paper

2076
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,120
number one that uh was

2077
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,520
looking at this question of what is an

2078
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,640
individual and they were looking at it

2079
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,480
from an information theory standpoint

2080
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:58,880
you know

2081
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,400
so they came up with this they came up

2082
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,120
with this uh

2083
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,800
uh theory

2084
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,040
uh and i think do they have a name for

2085
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,840
it yeah uh

2086
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,880
information theory of individuality and

2087
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,480
they say base it's done at the bottom of

2088
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,320
the slide there and they say basically

2089
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,440
that uh you know

2090
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,719
an individual is a process just what's

2091
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,080
what we've been talking about before

2092
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,679
that propagates information from the

2093
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,600
past into the future

2094
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,560
so that you know implies uh information

2095
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,640
flow and implies a cognitive

2096
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,920
process uh it implies anticipation of

2097
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,960
the future

2098
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,000
uh and it probably implies action and

2099
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,840
this thing that is an individual

2100
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,239
it is not like it is a layered

2101
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:43,840
hierarchical individual

2102
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,920
it's like you can draw a circle around

2103
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,880
anything

2104
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,199
you know in a certain sense and call it

2105
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,159
an individual

2106
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:53,520
under you know with certain

2107
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,199
uh definitions you know if you want to

2108
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,600
define what its markov blanket is

2109
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,760
but uh but you know we are we are we are

2110
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,920
our cells are individuals our tissues

2111
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,360
liver say is an individual um

2112
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,159
a human is an individual a family is an

2113
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,040
individual

2114
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,360
you know and it just keeps expanding

2115
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,080
outward from there

2116
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,320
the society is an individual so it

2117
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,400
really it's none of those are

2118
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,280
have you know any kind of inherent

2119
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,239
preference

2120
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,679
levels there's no preference to any of

2121
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,000
those levels everything's an individual

2122
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,080
layered interacting overlapping

2123
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,520
individuals and it's just

2124
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,640
it's just a it's really just a

2125
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,159
the idea of an individual is just where

2126
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,080
do you want to draw your circle

2127
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,320
and then you can you know then you can

2128
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,520
talk about an individual

2129
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,640
at whatever level you want so

2130
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,560
so that's all about information so it's

2131
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,320
all about processing information right

2132
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,800
and that's

2133
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,360
and so society is an individual and we

2134
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,520
are part of society and we're talking

2135
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,520
about societal systems and so at that

2136
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,080
level

2137
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,239
that seems to be our level of focus here

2138
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,400
at that level we can talk about society

2139
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,400
as an organism as a cognitive organism

2140
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,280
that is

2141
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,280
propagating information from the past

2142
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,400
into the future and

2143
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,080
from an active inference standpoint we

2144
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,520
can say uh

2145
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,640
under the you know under the fitness

2146
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,040
score

2147
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,800
whatever word you might want to use for

2148
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,360
that of reducing uncertainty

2149
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,560
so we act to reduce uncertainty right

2150
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
one interesting point on the ant colony

2151
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,000
again that's just it's the example

2152
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,360
i'm coming from is the 1911 paper by

2153
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,360
william morton wheeler is called the ant

2154
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,199
colony as an organism

2155
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,120
not a super organism because

2156
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,480
superorganism

2157
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
implies that nest mate would be the true

2158
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,679
organism

2159
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,840
and right that's something that insect

2160
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,040
with a six-legged version

2161
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,600
is now it's the whole super organism oh

2162
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,440
well the ant colony is society that

2163
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,880
whole frame

2164
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,320
is actually the shadow of

2165
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
what the evolutionary reality is which

2166
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,239
is that the ant colony is an organism

2167
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,080
not a super organism and the ants are

2168
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,280
tissues and so

2169
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,840
which level we prioritize or do we say

2170
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,640
no there's no

2171
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,280
a priori level ant is just i'm not even

2172
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,560
gonna say there's anything out there

2173
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,440
called ants

2174
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,199
it's it's you how you're thinking about

2175
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,960
it or do we get lost

2176
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,520
or are we going to find a ladder in that

2177
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,360
multi-scale

2178
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,520
yeah well the latter is you know the

2179
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,360
latter is active inference because it

2180
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,880
doesn't say

2181
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,159
active inference doesn't say make a

2182
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,080
make an internal model of the world that

2183
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,920
is accurate that actually

2184
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,640
accurately captures all the all the

2185
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,280
details

2186
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,159
of the world of the universe that's not

2187
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:34,719
the

2188
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,320
point that's not what the mind does

2189
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,080
that's not the point the point

2190
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,760
is to act under uncertainty

2191
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,120
given some useful model of the world act

2192
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,239
under uncertainty

2193
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,280
so that your fitness score improves

2194
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,199
and by fitness score here we essentially

2195
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,480
mean you know and

2196
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,360
anticipated uncertainty so i i would

2197
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,880
very much like to be

2198
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,159
have some certainty that i'm going to be

2199
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,719
alive tomorrow and if it's freezing

2200
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,480
outside and i don't have a coat on uh

2201
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,360
you know that

2202
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,239
that becomes iffy so uh i'm going to be

2203
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:06,800
happy

2204
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,639
if i'm going to be i'm going to go find

2205
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,400
a coat because it is going to reduce my

2206
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,360
uncertainty about

2207
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,600
survival over the next 24 hours but you

2208
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,639
can expand that

2209
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,679
you know outward right we we need to act

2210
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,840
the all organisms are acting under

2211
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,120
uncertainty

2212
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,840
and and we can think about that as we

2213
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,440
can think about that

2214
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,560
um we can think from that perspective as

2215
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,400
a society of

2216
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,920
what are we doing and how do we measure

2217
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,840
success well we're measuring success by

2218
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,400
acting

2219
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,880
under uncertainty and then re and then

2220
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,639
paying attention to what happens

2221
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,880
and then acting the same or differently

2222
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,000
or you know

2223
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,280
some other way or somehow some were

2224
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,840
then choosing to act again in this cycle

2225
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,960
of act

2226
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,080
uh you know act uh process act process

2227
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,440
act process you know

2228
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,840
model act model act model that reminds

2229
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,360
me of course of the ooda

2230
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,639
observe orient side act model and other

2231
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,320
sort of cyclic models of action and

2232
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,199
perception

2233
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,639
and then i would say that active

2234
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,719
inference provides a few nice little

2235
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:07,360
benefits

2236
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,679
over other phrasings of action and

2237
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:10,719
perception

2238
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:13,280
qualitative and philosophical ones like

2239
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,639
inactivism

2240
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,480
as well as quantitative ones like

2241
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,000
cybernetics and

2242
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,600
other kinds of control theories so i

2243
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,360
totally agree this is nice

2244
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,960
stuff and uh nice we can carry on if you

2245
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,120
want you want to go to town okay

2246
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,560
yeah yeah ten let's go to ten so

2247
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,000
everybody's listening you can ask

2248
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,600
questions in the live chat

2249
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,159
or you can um join us in the jam board

2250
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,280
and flip over to

2251
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,400
slide ten so uh so so i so i'm

2252
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,920
thoroughly enjoying this conversation

2253
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,679
but is it true that we have about

2254
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,560
uh a half hour left of it yep we have

2255
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:46,960
30.

2256
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,440
is it going that fast okay i believe so

2257
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,480
we can we can

2258
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,960
slice slides or move slides to another

2259
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,920
day

2260
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,080
so however you want to do i'll i'll try

2261
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,360
to go or i can chill

2262
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,559
for a few more minutes afterwards

2263
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,000
try to go a little quicker but there's

2264
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,520
so many things to say you know there's

2265
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,400
this

2266
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,560
you know it's it's one thing to read the

2267
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,840
paper and

2268
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,400
you know kind of written in a you know

2269
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:10,960
sort of

2270
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,400
scientific terminology and you know it's

2271
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,880
but it but it doesn't really convey the

2272
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,440
feeling

2273
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,360
you know you have to kind of think about

2274
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,199
what is the feeling of this

2275
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,360
whole project and we can do that better

2276
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,120
in a conversation i think

2277
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,159
agreed okay so so so then

2278
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:31,440
you know we're on this topic of what is

2279
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,120
what is our worldview what do we value

2280
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,960
and what is our purpose and then we've

2281
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,320
come to this question then

2282
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,480
okay so who the heck are we then you

2283
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,360
know we're

2284
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,639
we're and it and not only who are we but

2285
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,400
who are we building these systems for

2286
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,280
you know what what

2287
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,199
what is what should societal system

2288
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,120
serve who or what should societal

2289
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,320
systems serve

2290
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,440
and the only reasonable answer that you

2291
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,280
can come up with

2292
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,719
is that societal systems should serve

2293
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,760
the the extended self like

2294
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,080
not just the body not just the family

2295
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,199
not just the

2296
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,560
you know the thousand people in a

2297
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,320
society or the ten thousand or a million

2298
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,239
or whatever but their environment

2299
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,639
the the society next door that they're

2300
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:15,600
engaged with

2301
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
and cooperating with and coordinating

2302
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,639
with

2303
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,199
the society across the planet that

2304
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,440
they're sharing information with and

2305
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,480
learning together with and so it's the

2306
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:26,960
whole

2307
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,880
that we are metrics as we as leaders who

2308
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,840
come to metrics those metrics have to

2309
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,920
represent both the cognitive process how

2310
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,560
good how are we cogniting how well are

2311
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,080
we cogniting

2312
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,360
are we functionally cogniting and are we

2313
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,679
achieving through that cognition

2314
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,320
are we achieving the kinds of aims that

2315
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,600
is serving the whole

2316
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,639
is the environment improving is the you

2317
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:52,960
know

2318
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,679
quality of air improving is the quality

2319
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:56,239
of life

2320
01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:00,239
improving for individuals right

2321
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,159
um yes so uh we are so this in a

2322
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:04,880
nutshell we

2323
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,800
this is the world view in a way we are

2324
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,120
in intimate with our greater world

2325
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,520
we are individuals but of the nested

2326
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,800
overlapping variety

2327
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,320
individual cells bodies groups

2328
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,159
communities ecologies nations

2329
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,080
and all of civilization we're not

2330
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,000
separate in any absolute sense

2331
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,760
and there's no privileged level or scale

2332
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,520
to any of that

2333
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,600
nor are we passive bystanders in this

2334
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,800
unfolding this is not

2335
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,639
this evolution is not it's just a chance

2336
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,480
thing like by chance somebody does this

2337
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,520
one day and then

2338
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,639
evolution goes on another another

2339
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,239
avenue no there there are

2340
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,840
there are opportunities in the

2341
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,360
environment uh

2342
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,320
that we can react to that lend

2343
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,920
themselves to

2344
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,400
to to providing

2345
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,960
information or providing gain of benefit

2346
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,440
of some kind and

2347
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,719
and you know we are driven we are are we

2348
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,159
are consciously

2349
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,840
creating and you know

2350
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,480
even a really great societal system that

2351
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,639
integrated societal systems would be

2352
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,679
consciously creating acting cognitive

2353
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:12,960
acting cognitive and consciously

2354
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,199
creating and it towards some

2355
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,639
towards some goal

2356
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,040
and that goal then has to be you know

2357
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,679
the maintaining of vitality

2358
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,239
being the in the for the extended self

2359
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,199
all right so that comes the slide that's

2360
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,199
that's the topic of slide 11 and what is

2361
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,639
our purpose

2362
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:38,159
so so so over on the right there i

2363
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:39,800
just want to reemphasize we are

2364
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,560
anticipatory we are cognitive we are

2365
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,080
problem solvers

2366
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,360
we are a we and then i have below that

2367
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,320
i am a we you know like i i am i can i

2368
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,000
am

2369
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,880
i'm intimately connected with this i'm

2370
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
i'm everyone in that sense you know

2371
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,159
yep yeah the whitman um you know i

2372
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,080
contain multitudes and also gilbert at

2373
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,280
all i have a paper called

2374
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,760
um we were never individuals kind of on

2375
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,199
that wavelength that you were talking

2376
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,800
about with the sort of distributed

2377
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,920
systems all the way down

2378
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,880
approach and also dennis noble no

2379
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,360
privilege level of biological causality

2380
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,159
similar uh basically realization that

2381
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,360
multi-scale

2382
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,679
perspective complexity science basically

2383
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:22,480
entails

2384
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,760
either the choice of a priori level like

2385
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,679
saying it is multi-scale and

2386
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,560
humans are the best scale or gaia is the

2387
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,360
scale or

2388
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,520
quantum is the right scale that's a

2389
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,360
claim as well as it being a claim

2390
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,480
actually there's no

2391
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,800
privileged level of causality so that's

2392
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,159
the sort of table

2393
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:43,040
as it's said right right right right

2394
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,440
right

2395
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,560
and you know what it's not that really

2396
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,280
this this entire project you could say

2397
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,000
in

2398
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,159
like a sentence you could say this whole

2399
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,520
project is to

2400
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,360
help us be who we are more

2401
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,199
be more uh honestly who we are more real

2402
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:02,159
to who we

2403
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,280
are right it's not the it's not to to

2404
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,360
have people behave in some unusual way

2405
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,000
or some

2406
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,480
altruistic way or anything like that it

2407
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,080
is it is to have

2408
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,040
it is to be more more ourselves more

2409
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:15,600
fully

2410
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,159
ourselves more completely ourselves and

2411
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,280
then all of these

2412
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,560
pages all these things we're talking

2413
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,719
about is who that self is who

2414
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,040
who are we really and it's about the

2415
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,440
adjacent possible for who we are

2416
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,320
who we are is not an essence that is uh

2417
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,239
there's uh seven seals and it's being

2418
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:32,960
unlocked

2419
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,560
it's actually something that's being

2420
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,639
drawn out through

2421
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,040
inactive realization in the niche

2422
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,320
through niche modification through

2423
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,440
stigma

2424
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,600
through becoming and and then the

2425
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,840
adjacent possible is where the

2426
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,040
imagination and the planning comes into

2427
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:47,679
play

2428
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,840
and if people are hesitant to talk about

2429
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,199
the adjacent possible

2430
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,639
for who we could be just think about

2431
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,639
chess it's the adjacent possible with

2432
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,320
the strategy on the board

2433
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,920
and we're talking about the adjacent

2434
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,239
strategy possible for

2435
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,320
who we could be in terms of our strategy

2436
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,159
for you know all these recursive layers

2437
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,520
our strategy for how we think of

2438
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,560
ourselves and

2439
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,679
all these other things you're talking

2440
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,920
about absolutely absolutely

2441
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,679
and then and then ultimately serving the

2442
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,840
serving the kind of fitness purpose of

2443
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,560
you know if we take action a is that

2444
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,400
going to reduce our uncertainty about

2445
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,760
those things that we

2446
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,920
that really matter you know that are

2447
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,920
that are the the

2448
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,440
the key variables you know

2449
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,800
okay so uh so uh you know this is maybe

2450
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:35,199
a

2451
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,920
summary now we we've we've talked about

2452
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,639
about

2453
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,800
about who we are and i just want to say

2454
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,360
a few words then we have a purpose

2455
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,560
and uh from like a biological i call it

2456
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,480
an intrinsic purpose but like from

2457
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,360
evolution by being the fact that we are

2458
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
a part of life we have a purpose because

2459
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,400
all organisms

2460
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,280
making capability casual power causal

2461
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,239
powers

2462
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,719
and the intrinsic purpose of an organism

2463
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,560
is to achieve and maintain vitality a

2464
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,280
sustainable flourishing of self which

2465
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,400
can include that extended self and we do

2466
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,679
that by sensing and evaluating states of

2467
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,080
the world and ourselves and implementing

2468
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,920
appropriate actions that that are based

2469
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,440
on anticipation we

2470
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,679
we anticipate what will happen if we do

2471
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,760
or don't take an action and we choose

2472
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,920
if we're for functional we choose those

2473
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,520
actions that can

2474
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,480
serve our intrinsic intrinsic purpose of

2475
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,280
of

2476
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,520
remaining vital into the future so

2477
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,159
anticipating vitality

2478
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,000
and that obviously implies some kind of

2479
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,520
modeling of the world anticipation

2480
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,639
implies some kind of modeling in the

2481
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:43,840
world

2482
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,600
so that's an organism's intrinsic

2483
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,280
purpose and then society

2484
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:52,719
by you know by uh uh

2485
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,920
you know it's just that's necessarily

2486
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,960
shares a similar related intrinsic

2487
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,760
purpose

2488
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,440
which is to achieve and maintain

2489
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,960
vitality maintain

2490
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,199
and maintain and by maintain i mean

2491
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,159
anticipate

2492
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:09,199
into the future maintain

2493
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,040
vitality which is accomplished through

2494
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,360
cognition and cooperation

2495
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,199
so the self that we must keep vital is

2496
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,560
the extended self

2497
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,080
and it follows that the intrinsic

2498
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,159
purpose of societal systems

2499
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,400
like financial systems and other is to

2500
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,800
serve the intrinsic purpose of society

2501
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,360
so now we know or you know i mean we

2502
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,560
don't know i'm just i'm just putting

2503
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,280
this out from

2504
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,520
as my take on it but this is what i'm

2505
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,760
offering as a concept for the world to

2506
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,280
chew on you know

2507
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,440
uh all right and obviously i'm getting

2508
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,719
these ideas i'm not coming up with all

2509
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:40,960
these

2510
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,719
ideas myself i'm digesting

2511
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,960
hundreds of other papers that have been

2512
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,239
put into this

2513
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,600
kind of submarine in a way

2514
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,199
um so that's uh so that's

2515
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,080
why we need to our purpose is to remain

2516
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,679
vital into the future

2517
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,760
and and that and when we talk about the

2518
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,440
self that remains vital it's the

2519
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,639
larger itself

2520
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,280
all right so um slide 20

2521
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,840
uh or excuse me 12 yep yes

2522
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,560
slightly so there's a lot of discussion

2523
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
about complex systems you know

2524
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,560
we've been discussing complex systems

2525
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,400
and i just want to make a couple of

2526
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,040
points

2527
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,400
here because uh

2528
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,400
commonly some it is not uncommon that

2529
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,840
someone will say a complex system well

2530
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,600
that just means that it's

2531
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,520
liable to fall apart at any moment you

2532
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,960
know it's just too complex it's going to

2533
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,920
crash

2534
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,040
uh but and that that obviously can

2535
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,239
happen you know

2536
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,080
systems can collapse quite quite true

2537
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,080
but obviously life would not be doing

2538
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,199
very well if

2539
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,760
the if if the evolution builds

2540
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,280
complexity

2541
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,880
in species and you know in organisms

2542
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,639
and ecosystems if life would

2543
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,760
be have a rough go of it if it was so

2544
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,199
fragile that uh complexity became a

2545
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,480
burden

2546
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,520
and and uh you know come and then you

2547
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,719
know you reach a certain level of

2548
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,400
complexity and then you fall apart

2549
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,159
that's not really i don't think i mean

2550
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,600
that can happen but that's

2551
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,760
but but complex useful complexity

2552
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,199
doesn't make you fall apart

2553
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,679
it actually just does the opposite it

2554
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,440
serves what we've been talking about all

2555
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,080
along

2556
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,719
and that's problem solving so we are

2557
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,040
anticipatory organisms we are problem

2558
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,280
solving organisms it's our nature

2559
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,159
most of what the human brain does is to

2560
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:36,639
solve

2561
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,400
problems of one kind or another social

2562
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,080
problems physical problems

2563
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,920
whatever and maneuver in the world you

2564
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,719
know

2565
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,560
in a useful way and complexity is what

2566
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,199
allows that

2567
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,120
there's a number of studies that i cite

2568
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,480
here that show that as

2569
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,320
an organism even as a robot you know

2570
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,760
faces

2571
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,679
uh more difficult pressures from its

2572
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:02,480
environment

2573
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,520
it complexifies and complexifies

2574
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,880
by complexity then it's it's it implies

2575
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,320
a greater number of parts coordinating

2576
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,639
or cooperating in some way

2577
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,920
uh to you know solve this new challenge

2578
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,719
and obviously as a human we're very

2579
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,639
complex we have

2580
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,080
we have complex needs we have

2581
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,080
we can think not just what's going to

2582
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,679
happen in the next millisecond but

2583
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:30,639
what's going to happen

2584
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:31,760
we can think about what's going to

2585
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,840
happen in 100 years i mean part of this

2586
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,400
project

2587
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,000
is to think about what might be

2588
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,840
happening over the next hundred years

2589
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,360
or even a thousand years so

2590
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,080
as an organism complexifies it become it

2591
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,159
at least potentially becomes

2592
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:49,440
a better adapted to solving more complex

2593
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,639
problems so you could

2594
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,840
and from that sense you could almost ex

2595
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,800
equate complexity with problem-solving

2596
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,600
capacity

2597
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,280
you know at least in a uh you know in a

2598
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,280
general sense

2599
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,040
and then i talked about well that just

2600
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,719
reminds me of in the free energy

2601
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,480
calculations that we um

2602
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,360
have gone over in various papers it's

2603
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:11,840
like

2604
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,719
accuracy is the modeling imperative and

2605
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,800
then complexity is tolerated to the

2606
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,000
extent it facilitates

2607
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,840
accurate modeling so if you get the one

2608
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,920
parameter model and you got 99

2609
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,840
and it's adequate and it's good then

2610
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,280
you're good to go and you're gonna go

2611
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
for simplicity

2612
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,280
but then what you're saying is actually

2613
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:29,920
the um

2614
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,679
appearance and the hallmark of

2615
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,000
complexity in the world

2616
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,679
it means that that organism has

2617
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,159
the need to solve problems at a given

2618
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:41,119
level of

2619
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:44,159
counterfactual depth or

2620
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:47,199
inference skill or temporal depth

2621
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,119
temporal thickness

2622
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,000
exactly exactly exactly yeah that's

2623
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,600
that's it yeah

2624
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,880
yeah so uh so i talk in the in in this

2625
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,719
kind of middle of the paper now we talk

2626
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,800
i talk about a few ideas good regulators

2627
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,000
requisite variety

2628
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,880
self-organized criticality and then the

2629
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,320
free energy principle from

2630
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,840
active inference um and uh maybe i'll

2631
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,560
just

2632
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,199
try to briefly talk mention what's what

2633
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,000
those means for

2634
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,760
what those ideas mean for people who

2635
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,719
aren't familiar

2636
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,520
so good regulator really came from the

2637
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,320
good regular

2638
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,560
theorem or whatever it's called really

2639
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,880
came from cybernetics ash

2640
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,600
ashby yeah a lot his law of requisite

2641
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,719
variety and uh the it's the concept is

2642
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:40,320
that a organism or a

2643
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,679
you know a system must be

2644
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,119
must be a model of that which it but

2645
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,560
that needs to control so so

2646
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,920
i am humans are a model

2647
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,199
of their

2648
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,199
niche their their physical niche the

2649
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,760
gravity our bones are a model of gravity

2650
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,080
or

2651
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,760
you know we are our our

2652
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,800
our our complex

2653
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,600
problems that we face of maneuvering

2654
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,080
through

2655
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,159
the world with our senses and our

2656
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,320
sensitivities and our

2657
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,920
uh uh our

2658
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,360
you know vulnerabilities

2659
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,719
we have to be complex enough ourselves

2660
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,719
to handle a complex environment so

2661
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,400
that's just another way to

2662
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,960
saying that that systems complexify in

2663
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,080
order to handle

2664
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,320
uh you know adequately handle their

2665
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,440
environment

2666
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,440
and and part of that complexity then is

2667
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,600
having enough dials

2668
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,119
you know the system has to have enough

2669
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,920
dials and enough levers and enough

2670
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,119
movement uh opportunities to

2671
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,400
control that which uh to to control that

2672
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,719
which they need to control

2673
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:59,280
so a good controller has a similar

2674
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,239
variety

2675
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,920
to that which controls that's the

2676
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,840
requisite variety part

2677
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,679
and i just the technology allows us to

2678
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,600
um sort of play with that for example

2679
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,719
someone driving a car

2680
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:13,199
with the affordances of just their arms

2681
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,560
and degenerative model

2682
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,440
of the road can be driving in very

2683
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,119
challenging situations so this doesn't

2684
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,040
mean that you need to have the road

2685
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,040
inside of your head or need to be the

2686
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,800
road to drive on the road it's

2687
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,040
a statement about how action-oriented

2688
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,000
systems

2689
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,719
choose actions right right and maybe

2690
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,080
i'll just mention that that had

2691
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,719
that that plays out on all time scales

2692
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:35,520
right so the

2693
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,920
immediate mechanistic time scale the

2694
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,080
developmental time scale

2695
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,840
you know the uh the uh

2696
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,080
evolutionary time scale and everything

2697
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,000
in between

2698
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,840
right so you know because like uh an

2699
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,840
organism you know think of an organism

2700
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,800
that only once

2701
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,320
every century that has to deal with a

2702
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,199
a you know a one-year drought or

2703
01:37:59,199 --> 01:37:59,840
something

2704
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,679
well somewhere in the meccan in the

2705
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,920
mechanics of that organism has to be a

2706
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,280
little piece

2707
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,480
that is capable of digging down into the

2708
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,239
dirt and just hanging out for a hundred

2709
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:10,800
you know

2710
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,159
for a whole year or whatever without

2711
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,320
water even though that only happens once

2712
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,239
in a total blue moon you know

2713
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,880
like like we have to have this we have

2714
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,719
to have this flexibility within us

2715
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,679
even for those extremely rare but deadly

2716
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,280
you know potentially deadly

2717
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,840
uh scenarios and situations that we

2718
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,520
might face

2719
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,000
right okay so complexity essentially

2720
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,360
you can almost equate it with problem

2721
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,960
solving capacity and again the

2722
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,080
world numbers uh

2723
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,560
slide 13 513 help organize criticality

2724
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,080
so

2725
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,639
yeah so so maybe i want to just kind of

2726
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:51,679
back up for a moment

2727
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,639
and just say like again what is the

2728
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,320
purpose of going through this stuff

2729
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,199
you know i i mean i mean it's useful

2730
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,159
sure

2731
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,000
if you want to build some new system

2732
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,679
it's nice to know what the purpose of it

2733
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,280
is you know i mean obviously

2734
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,760
but uh but these ideas that we're

2735
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,719
talking about and

2736
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,400
self-organized criticality is one

2737
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,719
criticality is one of them these ideas

2738
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,000
can not only serve this larger context

2739
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,320
of

2740
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,840
understanding what it is we're trying to

2741
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,360
do here what is what what are we

2742
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,639
building what is this purpose

2743
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,119
how do we measure success you know it

2744
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,840
can have

2745
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,480
immediate uh uh input or immediate

2746
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,159
influence on

2747
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,880
uh how a design might happen and and

2748
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,280
this

2749
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,840
self-organized criticality is is one

2750
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,440
example of that

2751
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,280
so it's not just we're not just in the

2752
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,760
theoretical philosophical

2753
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,880
set here we're we're also talking

2754
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,760
nuts and bolts like okay so what might

2755
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,880
designs be

2756
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,480
like we have to think in our as we're

2757
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,760
going through the series you know we can

2758
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:52,719
think in our head okay that's

2759
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:53,600
interesting

2760
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,880
what kind of designs might reflect that

2761
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,000
concept and uh we'll

2762
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,360
we'll go into an example here with

2763
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,600
self-organized criticality so the idea

2764
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,159
there is

2765
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,760
that was coined by back back bak

2766
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,719
in 87 the term self-organized

2767
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:11,840
criticality and

2768
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,159
it's it's really not a controversial

2769
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,239
that that living systems and

2770
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,880
and many most systems in life complex

2771
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,840
systems

2772
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,080
organize in some way but the idea of

2773
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,840
self-organized criticality is that the

2774
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,880
organism itself

2775
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,840
is adjusting is is keeping some kind of

2776
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,880
adjustment

2777
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,320
uh to uh to maintain a critical state

2778
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,159
and by critical state i mean a state on

2779
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,679
the ver like you can think of a saddle

2780
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:36,080
point

2781
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,880
so if you drop a model on us on a saddle

2782
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,520
it's going to

2783
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,360
not stay there it's going to you know

2784
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,960
it's going to change

2785
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,639
it's going to change one way or the

2786
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,639
other right so a critical

2787
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,280
state is like that that threshold where

2788
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,760
things are about to change from

2789
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,199
one way to another way and uh

2790
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,520
it turns out with you know work and

2791
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,119
information theory and other other

2792
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,800
fields of recent

2793
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,239
in recent years it turns out that uh

2794
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,480
processing uh whether it's we're talking

2795
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,840
about a computer or some other

2796
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,119
you know machine or or a brain

2797
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,600
turns out that processing is kind of

2798
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,800
optimal in a sense

2799
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,560
when this when the system is at a

2800
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,520
this this this this critical state and

2801
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,639
some people call it on the

2802
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,520
edge of chaos because things are things

2803
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,320
can easily

2804
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,159
change and

2805
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,000
sometimes it's you can think of that

2806
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,360
threshold as a

2807
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,920
as a as a threshold of a critical state

2808
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,920
you can think of it as a threshold of

2809
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,080
the threshold we say between exploration

2810
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,000
and exploitation like should i

2811
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,119
should i go should i go

2812
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:49,040
find a new planet for humans to live on

2813
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,000
or should i fix

2814
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,679
the planet that you know should i fix

2815
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:53,280
the systems on this planet first you

2816
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,080
know

2817
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,560
how do we balance exploration of the new

2818
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,199
versus

2819
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,520
using the information we have to improve

2820
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,520
what we already have

2821
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,760
so you can think of that as exploration

2822
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,520
exploitation trade-offs stability

2823
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,960
agility trade-off do we

2824
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,119
do we remain stable and use ideas from

2825
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,880
the old in the past or do we

2826
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,040
are we more agile and we're more

2827
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,679
flexible and we bring in new new ideas

2828
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,280
so it's like you can call it old new

2829
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,440
trade old new trade-off but whatever

2830
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,960
whatever trade-off you want to call it

2831
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,440
it's this sitting at the edge

2832
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,719
of going one way or the other

2833
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:29,520
maximally flexible of going one way or

2834
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,960
the other

2835
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,440
and it's at that threshold that level

2836
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,000
that

2837
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,920
point the kind of that region of

2838
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,199
criticality that

2839
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,760
information processing seems to be

2840
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,960
maximal so if

2841
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,360
uh it's no wonder then that the human

2842
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,480
brain is

2843
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,920
is organized in such a way to be

2844
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,719
living on this threshold between agility

2845
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,719
and stability

2846
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:54,560
and uh now here's an example of that

2847
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,639
from like a real world example

2848
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,679
so a a

2849
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:02,560
system that is at a critical state is

2850
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,840
going to be maximally

2851
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,119
sensitive to input so that means that

2852
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,880
there could you know when just when that

2853
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,040
marble is sitting on the saddle

2854
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,440
just a little bump to that saddle from

2855
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,560
one little corner

2856
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,320
of its universe and right like just one

2857
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,560
little organism bumps it

2858
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,960
and maybe that marble rolls one way or

2859
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,400
the other right so that

2860
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,600
one one little input had a major

2861
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,360
impact on how the whole thing moves

2862
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,600
its trajectory into the future right but

2863
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,560
isn't that what we

2864
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,239
isn't that kind of what we have in mind

2865
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:35,920
for democracy i mean don't we

2866
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,239
want

2867
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,840
everyone to have access of engaging into

2868
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,440
the decision-making processes

2869
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:46,560
of a society and have every voice heard

2870
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,040
in at least in the sense that there's

2871
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,040
the possibility that just my voice just

2872
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,080
me doing my

2873
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,639
participation in this system might

2874
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,239
actually

2875
01:43:56,239 --> 01:44:00,320
ripple through the system and have a

2876
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,880
uh you know a real effect a useful

2877
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:03,679
effect

2878
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,400
i mean i think like maybe maybe

2879
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,159
self-organized criticality can

2880
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,960
help to inform us the concept of

2881
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,719
self-organized criticality can help to

2882
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:13,360
inform us

2883
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,960
of what do we want from democracy or a

2884
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,199
decision-making process

2885
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,639
right you know that just makes me think

2886
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,960
about different like landslides

2887
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,040
and that's something that criticality

2888
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,639
theory and catastrophe theory has been

2889
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,000
used to study

2890
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,920
and instead of cascading failure we can

2891
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,840
think about like cascading

2892
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
neighborhood cleanups so a bunch of

2893
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,960
people just say

2894
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,560
today just for an hour i feel like doing

2895
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,480
a little cleanup and all of a sudden

2896
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,560
one person puts up the flag and then

2897
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,080
it's cascading locally

2898
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,400
in some just you know unspecified way

2899
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,840
but all of a sudden you're getting this

2900
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,080
this distribution with a ton of small

2901
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,119
little meetups

2902
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,360
and then several really large sweeping

2903
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,159
changes

2904
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,080
but the total number of people cleaning

2905
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,159
up is higher because you offered the

2906
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,600
affordance and the ability for the

2907
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,920
affordance to sort of propagate

2908
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,280
that's right that's right we're talking

2909
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:02,960
about a propagation of

2910
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,800
of a propagation of information a

2911
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,560
propagation of action

2912
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,520
and the possibility that even uh you

2913
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,000
know just

2914
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,159
one or a few individuals could start a

2915
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,920
little chain chain reaction that

2916
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,840
actually does

2917
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:18,320
affect in a positive way society

2918
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,239
now it's a little too it's almost too

2919
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,400
bad that sand piles were the original uh

2920
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,520
you know topic of

2921
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,840
of this of self-organized criticality

2922
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,119
because as you point out

2923
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,880
it's not really about things falling

2924
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,320
apart it's about

2925
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,400
it's about if you think of again if you

2926
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,080
think of a complex system as

2927
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,760
a system more capable of solving more

2928
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,960
challenging problems then more often

2929
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,880
you can think of self-organized

2930
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,760
criticality as a way to propagate

2931
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,320
information when it is really needed

2932
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,119
when the system needs to change

2933
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,719
uh then information is you know it

2934
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,960
ingests information from its world from

2935
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,239
its senses

2936
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,880
and can act accordingly we we just um

2937
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,400
submitted an abstract with

2938
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,159
criticality and active inference and one

2939
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,679
of the points was actually

2940
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:07,360
the existence of self-organized

2941
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,440
criticality implies a far from

2942
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,800
equilibrium system

2943
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,119
that's actively pumping energy in that's

2944
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:15,440
because it's a passive system that's not

2945
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,159
locked and loaded you don't get that

2946
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,760
kind of a non-linear response when you

2947
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,440
poke it it just stays there

2948
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,880
right right right right

2949
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,040
and i think you know maybe we won't have

2950
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,239
time to go into it

2951
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:30,320
right now but this also the idea of

2952
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,600
criticality is

2953
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,560
a little bit at the center of of

2954
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,280
structural

2955
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,080
organization of society through you know

2956
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,760
in the active inference

2957
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,199
theme like how is it that that that

2958
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:44,560
organisms and life

2959
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,440
and other systems then you know form

2960
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,679
structures will they form structures

2961
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,119
so that as you were just saying they

2962
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,159
form structures so

2963
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,560
that they can maximally cognate and

2964
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,560
those that happens to be

2965
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,800
structures that are existing in some

2966
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,920
sense near

2967
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,880
critical thresholds so and that and as

2968
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,159
also as you mentioned that of course

2969
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:07,040
takes energy you know

2970
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,840
it takes energy to make that happen you

2971
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,520
have to eat food to

2972
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,880
think you know right nice

2973
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,360
14.

2974
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,480
okay so now finally we get to active

2975
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,639
inference all this discussion and we're

2976
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,560
finally getting to the point here right

2977
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,119
for his lab

2978
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,440
so um i had and i had already touched on

2979
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
some of this before but

2980
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,480
um it would you know today

2981
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,480
if you're going to develop a really good

2982
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,520
ai system

2983
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,280
you're and you're going to have a you

2984
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,360
have a robot saying the robot has to act

2985
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:48,960
in some environment

2986
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,199
it is pretty well understood that that

2987
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:52,320
if you program

2988
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,480
that robot to you give it a you give it

2989
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,080
a i mean traditionally you'll give it a

2990
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,639
a

2991
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,440
a fitness function or some kind of

2992
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,800
valuation

2993
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,760
function and it's for example it's good

2994
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,480
if it

2995
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,159
it you know you lose points if you fall

2996
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,679
through a trap door and is

2997
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,000
and you get points if you uh you know

2998
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,280
whatever

2999
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,639
find find the piece of cake or something

3000
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,440
well that's uh that's fine for extremely

3001
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,360
simple universes that your robot might

3002
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,679
work in but as soon as you get beyond

3003
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:22,880
you know as soon as you get to any kind

3004
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,800
of more realistic uh

3005
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,040
universe that your robot has to work in

3006
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,639
that pre-programming

3007
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,639
pre-programming concept just kind of

3008
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,239
falls apart it is you you

3009
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,960
it would require the the the

3010
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,040
practitioner to think ahead of all the

3011
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,040
things that the robot might encounter

3012
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,360
and then how to value certain you know

3013
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,199
value those situations in certain ways

3014
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:48,320
uh and that is really uh what active

3015
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,040
inference

3016
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,400
offers is a is a kind of a cognitive

3017
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,520
understanding or

3018
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,440
a mechanism by which an organism

3019
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,800
will uh uh where its

3020
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,119
fitness score is in a sense

3021
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:08,560
involves both uh you know achieving

3022
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,440
goals

3023
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,800
and exploring its world to for

3024
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,080
for for epistemic gain so

3025
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,800
um that's what we would like the that's

3026
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,639
how we would like to program the robot

3027
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,440
in a sense

3028
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,639
so that it can learn from it can learn

3029
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,960
on the fly from its experiences

3030
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,080
it can it can alter its actions and

3031
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:30,960
goals

3032
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,080
as it be as it becomes clear as it

3033
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,679
gathers more information from its

3034
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:37,920
universe as it as it meets new

3035
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,920
situations that were never

3036
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,560
never conceived of by the by the

3037
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:43,760
programmer

3038
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,159
that it through through an active

3039
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,480
inference or an active inference like uh

3040
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,960
you know mechanism it can learn and

3041
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,760
explore and

3042
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,880
and critically balance exploration with

3043
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,639
exploitation and then we come right back

3044
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,320
to that whole concept of

3045
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,880
criticality so you know what you would

3046
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,280
really like your robot to do is remain

3047
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,480
at that critical uh phase between

3048
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,880
exploring what's out there and making

3049
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,280
use and gold directed behavior of what's

3050
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:12,320
in front of it

3051
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,920
and um and uh you know that's how you

3052
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,159
could program this world this robot to

3053
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,159
act in the world and be pretty good at

3054
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,400
it you know if you if you build it well

3055
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,800
so that's what the systems of a society

3056
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,239
can help a society to do

3057
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:28,560
you you don't you it's worth talking

3058
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,239
about building new systems i think it

3059
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,080
would not be wise to say

3060
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,239
this checklist of like we wanted this

3061
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:36,639
level of education we want to

3062
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,560
want this you know to react this way in

3063
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,000
this situation react this way in this

3064
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,719
situation

3065
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,679
and this level of uh you know whatever

3066
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,520
money and this level of this and this

3067
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,199
level of that

3068
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,280
while those kinds of preferences can be

3069
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,639
a useful start

3070
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:54,320
society has to be alive in its moment

3071
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,239
you know in the moment as society is

3072
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:57,840
alive it's cognating it's

3073
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,199
it's it's it's actively uh you know

3074
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,599
comparing what it's the result of its

3075
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:06,639
actions to the model that is in its head

3076
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,280
and uh so active inference offers this

3077
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:09,679
way

3078
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,280
to uh to balance uh exploration

3079
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,960
and and uh and uh

3080
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,280
exploitation and remain critical and

3081
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,639
remain optimally

3082
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,480
cognitive right so that's part of it

3083
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,480
uh and then part of it i mean and for me

3084
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,920
this the the

3085
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,880
the idea of the embodied uh you know the

3086
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,280
three

3087
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:35,840
four e's uh

3088
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,800
this is what i really am attracted to in

3089
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,560
active inference is in a sense it's kind

3090
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,280
of a simple

3091
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,440
concept it's not really very complicated

3092
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,679
you know if you've studied bayesian

3093
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:56,719
uh theory it all it's kind of straight

3094
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:57,679
you know in a way it's kind of

3095
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:58,800
straightforward

3096
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,440
but the the you know the way fristen has

3097
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,119
connected the dots

3098
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:06,000
and and and and uh extended that into

3099
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,760
the bigger picture of life kind of it

3100
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:11,360
it to me it is uh it is rich

3101
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,360
there's a there's a lot yet to be

3102
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,520
learned and gained and explored

3103
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,040
in this umbrella of active inference

3104
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,800
awesome okay so we're getting close to

3105
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,000
the end here i don't know if maybe we

3106
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,400
should

3107
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,520
call it quits or um you know we could

3108
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,080
either

3109
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,560
go a few minutes over to just walk

3110
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,440
through these last

3111
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:35,119
few slides or we could um just uh do

3112
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,920
whatever you'd like to do you know i

3113
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,400
think

3114
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,800
because i can see now i'm not very good

3115
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,320
at walking fast i'm

3116
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,440
i i'm too verbose we you know

3117
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,520
it goes through a lot it goes through a

3118
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,280
lot so i think it's it's actually

3119
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,760
it's good to sometimes just take these

3120
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,199
little side paths

3121
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,199
yeah well maybe that maybe this you know

3122
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,800
leaving it at the at active inference

3123
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,159
maybe that's a good stopping point

3124
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,159
well well then maybe to kind of close on

3125
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,920
that active inference note

3126
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,639
um you know we are the active inference

3127
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:05,199
lab

3128
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:06,639
and so we always think about these

3129
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,639
sessions as a two directional

3130
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,719
highway there's people who are in the

3131
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,000
active inference community

3132
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,800
who are being exposed to some new ideas

3133
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,159
and then there's people who are being

3134
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,119
drawn in

3135
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,560
by these other things that you're

3136
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,480
bringing up which are so pressing

3137
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,040
as far as the issues as well as systems

3138
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,560
that influence everyone like governance

3139
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,679
information

3140
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:26,960
maybe this is the first time they're

3141
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,800
hearing about active inference so it's

3142
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,599
sort of like

3143
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,400
we're uh on the cliffhanger and maybe

3144
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,000
when we come back next week we can

3145
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,480
really

3146
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,360
um do a little recap and then start in

3147
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:37,920
with

3148
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,679
where is active inference coming into

3149
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,040
play how are we going to make it

3150
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:41,760
specific

3151
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,440
how are we going to include people in

3152
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,280
this process what would it look like to

3153
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,239
do

3154
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,400
it's a really nice spot i think to to

3155
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,840
kind of pause

3156
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:53,199
okay sounds good nice so um

3157
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:56,719
we will hang out again uh 3 p.m

3158
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:00,080
on april 13th pacific time

3159
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,599
and uh that will be the second of the

3160
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,280
three sessions so thanks

3161
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,880
again for joining john this is like an

3162
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,119
awesome discussion and i hope people

3163
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:10,400
read the papers and we can share this

3164
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,840
first youtube link and invite people for

3165
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,880
next week's

3166
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,880
session which will be yeah at the time

3167
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,000
stated so

3168
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,199
thanks everyone see you later thanks
