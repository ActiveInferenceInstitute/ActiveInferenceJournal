1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,880
okay

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
hello and welcome to active inference

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,160
lab this

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,839
is the third in a ongoing series of

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,880
discussions

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
between i guess active inference lab and

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,400
john boyk

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in california

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
and i'm going to be kind of

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,640
working through the jam board as we've

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
done in these other

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
sessions while john goes through his

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,439
paper

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
some of the implications we can also

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
raise up some questions from the live

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
chat so people are totally

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
welcome to um leave questions in there

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
wait actually it's already sort of

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,520
messed up

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,160
or not sure i hope that it will work it

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,120
looks like it's okay

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
we're just sort of dealing with the

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,800
streaming tech and i'll play with it

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,879
once you start talking jon but um yep

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
i hope this uh is a fun discussion

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,239
because the other ones have been awesome

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:58,640
as well

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
so i'll flip over to slide 14 from our

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,079
second

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
slideshow and let you pick up with some

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,438
points from last time

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,799
and uh let you know if anything is awry

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
okay sounds good thank you my name is

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,000
john boyk i'm

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
a courtesy faculty at oregon state

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
university environmental science

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
graduate program

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
and this series is about our series of

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
discussions is about a

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,439
series of three papers that i recently

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
published in the journal sustainability

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,759
and the topic is societal transformation

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
um i think somewhere in the middle of

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
this talk we'll show some links to those

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
papers and

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
and to my website where all this

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
information can be found

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
uh so we're do you have the slides up

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
you want to put up slide 14

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
we're just going to jump in we're going

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
to jump into halfway through the last

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
talk we had a bunch of slides that we

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,280
didn't get to

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
so we're going to try to get to them

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
um now yep i'm there so i'll be

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
following along but you just won't see

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
it but we're good to go

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
oh i won't see it okay all right okay

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
all right so uh slide 14

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
is uh is a list of 14 desired data that

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
i had

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
proposed in this second the second paper

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
part two

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
uh i should probably say what the title

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,200
of that series is the title is science

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
driven societal transformation parts one

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
two and three

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
so we were talking about part two last

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
time which

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
was on um

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
motivation and strategy and we're going

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
to continue with that now

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
um so in that part two paper i had

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
listed 14 desert data for what any

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
what would be what maybe could or should

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
be in any r

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
d program aimed at societal

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,599
transformation

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,239
um throughout the series i touch on all

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
of these fourteen

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
um i would just like to make

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,720
clear that what i'm proposing the series

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
the three-part series is itself

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
a proposal for an r d program it's kind

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
of an informal proposal to the world

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,840
about

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
a program that could be started and

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
it is possible that other people have

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,080
other groups have other ideas of what

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,879
kind of r d

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
program you know could be constructed

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
and

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
you know it could be that in the future

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,200
there's

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,239
numerous uh r d programs that are in

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
operation that are all looking at this

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
topic of societal transformation

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
and i wanted to offer a list of uh of

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,519
points or topics that that each of them

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,560
might

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,599
address and that way at the very least

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,840
we could compare programs by comparing

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,480
these for

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
14 points

105
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,480
um i just we we covered we went through

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,599
him last time so i'm not going to go

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
through him again but i just wanted to

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
say a couple of things

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
uh daniel i remember from our last

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
conversation you had said something

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,439
about

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
um you know getting a a bunch of

113
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,480
scientists together and maybe they won't

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,519
agree on

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
you know different aspects of this and

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
there you know could be

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
some arguments for

118
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
one point over another point or one

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
approach over another approach

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
and that of course that is true and

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
that's fine and that's good there

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,798
should be a variety of voices uh heard

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,840
and considered in in any r d program

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,880
but i i did want to make the point that

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,080
the r d program that i'm proposing the

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,120
the concept

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,080
is evidence-based science-driven r d

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,560
program

129
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
so um suppose

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
that uh well let me say that

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
that an evident evidence-based program

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,479
is different than a popularity-based

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,759
program

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
so it's not just that you know everyone

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
gets to vote for what they want and

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,160
it'll

137
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
and and the r d program would go off in

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
in whatever direction

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
everyone votes for i mean in in a sense

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,919
that's true because

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
how else would you govern things but in

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,759
another sense it's not true because

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
there has to be some kind of

144
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,039
science process i mean we have to be

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,400
addressing with the

146
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
with a design program we have to be

147
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
addressing the

148
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
the science-based aspects of

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
it so um and that is largely driven by

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,400
fitness

151
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
purpose and fitness so the so

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
all right um let's see

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
yep just continue going ahead thank you

154
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
okay we're good yep

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
okay all right uh i was saying that um

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
that there could be multiple p multiple

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,120
uh

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
uh r d programs proposed by different

159
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,160
groups

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
driven by different groups but i would i

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
would expect that they would all be

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
based on some kind of science-based

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,240
evidence

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
approach so while while each

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
r d program might have a slightly

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
different way of measuring fitness

167
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
those discussions would be based on

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
scientific evidence and reasonable

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
you know reasonable evidence as opposed

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,319
to just a popularity

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,319
we're good yep working with tech

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,240
thank you everyone for standing by when

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,319
it kind of flips out for a second

174
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,840
we'll try to restart it like as soon as

175
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,919
possible but that's why we use the

176
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,880
asynchronous

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
modes of work because we're really lucky

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
when we get to have synchronous time

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
with the authors or with anyone but the

180
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
asynchronous

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
and the updates on the comments are what

182
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,160
really

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
matter for this kind of a project not

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
someone's internal

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
understanding or just a dialogue so

186
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
thanks for bearing with us everyone go

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
ahead john

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
okay just to make that last point is the

189
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,240
r d program that i've proposed

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
is really it's really a meta meta

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,039
framework for learning new systems

192
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
new system designs so the idea is that

193
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,319
the

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
the r d program would look at a wide

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,599
variety of

196
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,680
of designs people people it would

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,800
provide a way

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,240
a means for evaluation of different

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
designs that different groups might come

200
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,880
up with

201
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
so that's all i wanted to cover on that

202
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:17,840
topic and then on to new information

203
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
so

204
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
okay

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:27,840
yep okay we'll be able to do it right

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
okay here is this

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
this is going to work give me one second

208
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
all right thanks everyone for holding by

209
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
i hope that you

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,600
enjoyed this section

211
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
the silence to think about these ideas

212
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,160
okay so now

213
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
it's called making lemonade out of yeah

214
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,279
okay

215
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
so now i will spend some of the time

216
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
when you're talking

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
john to just continue like trimming and

218
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
stuff but

219
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
we actually um are back

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,839
in the game so please continue

221
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
on 5 15 and 2 and go from there and then

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
continue on so sorry about that first 15

223
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,800
minutes of fun

224
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,360
now go for it just one little thing my

225
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,000
screen

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
my picture on my computer is quite dark

227
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
but i don't know if i'm coming through

228
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
on everyone else's computer

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
looks good and i'm going to fix it on

230
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,279
the other computer okay all right

231
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
all right so slide 15. uh

232
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
uh i was saying before before the

233
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,639
interruption

234
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
that uh this r d just a few things on

235
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,320
the rd program it's a

236
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
it has a as i envisioned at a 50-year

237
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,440
horizon so this

238
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
is um this is a careful movement

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,959
towards societal transformation it's

240
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,839
going to take a

241
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,839
a a long time but um

242
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
there will studies will be if it were

243
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,279
funded if it

244
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
moved forward studies would start right

245
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
away field trials would

246
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,360
follow in in the near term and those

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
communities that

248
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
choose to participate in field trials

249
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
would see you know

250
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,079
benefits far faster than than than

251
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,880
in other communities that are waiting so

252
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
this is a 50-year horizon towards

253
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
a global scale or no near global scale

254
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,079
transformation so it's going to take a

255
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,200
while

256
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
to to achieve change at uh you know at

257
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,920
that

258
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
huge scale um

259
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
uh i also want to mention that the

260
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
program involves the public in a variety

261
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,600
of ways this is i

262
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
envision this as a partnership between

263
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
the public

264
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,480
especially between local communities

265
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
and the science the global science

266
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
community

267
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,079
so there would be field trials there

268
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,519
would be a variety of studies and the

269
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,279
public can get involved in a variety of

270
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,000
ways

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
there would be lab lab studies there

272
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
would be surveys there would be

273
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
the ability for the public to in

274
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
input their ideas and their their wishes

275
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,839
and desires into the program so

276
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,839
hopefully this would be a

277
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
a conversation a multi-way conversation

278
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,480
between the stakeholders

279
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,320
that are involved and uh on the science

280
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,959
side

281
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,880
uh i mostly want to

282
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
make the point that the program could

283
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
involve nearly every academic field

284
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
that's out there literally in a to z

285
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
and at the bottom of this slide i just

286
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,399
list a few of the many

287
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,940
fields that would be appropriate here

288
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,000
[Applause]

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,320
certainly some of the the science fields

290
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,000
have been talking about complex science

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,320
and

292
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,880
other fields like that but also

293
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
education

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
media literature linguistics

295
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
like you name it and there would be a

296
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
place a need for

297
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
participation in this project

298
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,800
okay next slide 16.

299
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
okay we're good yep all right

300
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,800
uh so um

301
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,279
you know the idea that the science world

302
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,920
would be

303
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
actively participating in a program for

304
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
societal transformation this is

305
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
you know in a sense this is rather bold

306
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,079
and new

307
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,440
uh novel um there there obviously are

308
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
programs aimed at the study of of

309
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,600
transitions and

310
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,240
and and

311
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
developing the knowledge base for

312
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,720
societal trans uh

313
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
some kind of a societal transformation

314
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
because many

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
in the science world and the public

316
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
policy world understand that bold change

317
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,959
is necessary if we're going to uh you

318
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,000
know uh

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
avert the avert problems that we're

320
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,120
facing

321
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
due to climate change uh bio

322
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
biodiversity loss and a number of other

323
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
very serious

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,760
social and environmental problems so big

325
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,320
change

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
deep change is on many many uh

327
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
people's minds but

328
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,800
uh science uh the role that science

329
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
has that many people envision for

330
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,720
science is more of a knowledge

331
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
is more than the traditional science

332
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
world the knowledge

333
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,759
gathering knowledge product production

334
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
that would support the public and and

335
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
politicians and choosing new policies

336
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,759
and various things

337
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
so the idea that science would be

338
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,279
involved in the actual

339
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,800
r d of making new systems designing new

340
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
systems testing new systems

341
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
that's more of a what is

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,839
being called second order science and

343
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,560
that is fairly new in the science world

344
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,920
so this is uh this is breaking new

345
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,480
ground

346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
for uh force for the science world

347
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
so i i have a bullet list here of

348
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,320
various reasons why

349
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
the science community might want to be

350
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
involved in this

351
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
so i'll just go through a few of these

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,680
real quick um

353
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
first societal the idea that society is

354
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,600
a

355
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
can be understood as a organism a super

356
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
organism if you will

357
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
and a cognitive organism at that is

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,040
is timely and important and

359
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,759
offers numerous opportunities to advance

360
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,480
basic

361
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
science knowledge so um so

362
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,639
while in in participating in a program

363
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:54,959
of

364
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
societal transformation a great amount

365
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,399
of

366
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,759
science knowledge would be generated uh

367
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,319
next is systems are societal systems are

368
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,359
sophisticated

369
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,000
so uh the the skills that are offered by

370
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,439
the science community are extremely

371
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,079
important

372
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,160
uh they would have to be computers

373
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
computer simulations for example and a

374
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
variety of other very technical

375
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
uh problems that would have to be solved

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,240
in order for this for

377
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
new systems to really work and for the

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
design process to work

379
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,320
so uh for that you know the science

380
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
community is uniquely

381
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
uniquely qualified to contribute to

382
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
those effects

383
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
uh the goals of transformation are

384
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,320
ambitious

385
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
this is the third bullet and yet the

386
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
time available for action is short so

387
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,919
this has to be

388
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,720
not tinkering but moving in a direct and

389
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
focused way towards societal

390
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
transformation and the developing new

391
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
systems

392
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
and the science community can help with

393
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
that to keep it all on track and moving

394
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
forward

395
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
i've already mentioned the second order

396
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,919
science threshold

397
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
threshold to a new way of doing science

398
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,919
and that can be useful

399
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,720
and involve science more in the public

400
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
sphere in the future

401
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,039
and the next is that the science

402
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
community is trusted by the global

403
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
public so

404
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
uh and is a bishop and then is a

405
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
position to help focus public attention

406
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,480
on

407
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
pressing problems and and solutions

408
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
next to the last one is the science

409
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
community can offer a global

410
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
perspective and global coordination so

411
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,559
what we would not want

412
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,679
are a whole bunch of experiments to

413
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
occur for the r d program and then to be

414
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
forgotten and never picked up again or

415
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,039
never integrated into the body of

416
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,080
knowledge after that

417
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
so the science community can offer a

418
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,120
central

419
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,679
in a sense a central focal point a

420
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
repository for data and for assessing

421
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
data and for assessing the many

422
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
experiments

423
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
that might occur in such a r d program

424
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
and lastly the science community can act

425
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
as a powerful ally to the public

426
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,880
uh in promoting and ensuring that

427
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,360
transformation moves forward

428
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
so i hope that i hope that the science

429
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
community will find interest

430
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,679
in this kind of r d project that's

431
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,440
really the purpose of the whole series

432
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
is to

433
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,679
is to offer the the idea to the science

434
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,960
community that

435
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,559
we could do this together this could be

436
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,799
a very important and timely

437
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
uh service that the science community

438
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,840
offers to the world

439
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
all right on to 17

440
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
all right so

441
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,120
and i said this before but if if i were

442
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
the smartest person on the planet and i

443
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
came up with a fantastic

444
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,480
new design for societal systems and and

445
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,440
for viewers that are new by societal

446
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
systems i mean economic systems

447
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,559
financial systems

448
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,640
governance systems educational systems

449
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
legal systems and the like

450
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
um if i were the smartest person i came

451
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,799
up with

452
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
perfectly designed societal systems

453
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
if there was no way to implement them

454
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,480
practically then my effort would have

455
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
been waste wasted

456
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
so any r d program aimed at societal

457
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
transformation has to have

458
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,679
some kind of viable strategy for

459
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
implementing any new designs that might

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
be created

461
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
and uh in this in the proposal in the

462
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,840
series i i

463
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,480
i offer a theory of change and a

464
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,559
strategy for change that i call

465
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,000
local global viral and the idea

466
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
there is the local global is the idea

467
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
that local

468
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
that much of the work would occur at in

469
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,039
local communities

470
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
and by local communities i mean

471
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
volunteer communities

472
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,520
volunteer individuals who would develop

473
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,320
who would

474
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
uh participate in the in the in the

475
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
testing of new systems

476
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
and and even the design of new systems

477
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
uh in cooperation with and partnership

478
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
with the global science community so we

479
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
have the local global

480
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
connection there and

481
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
and the viral connection is such that

482
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
the

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,520
the concept of the of the

484
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
i i use what i call a club model and the

485
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
concept of the clubs is that clubs would

486
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
be implemented locally but on a

487
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
volunteer basis as i mentioned and they

488
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,960
would be designed

489
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
such to produce substantial benefits for

490
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
the participants

491
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
and if that is if they're well designed

492
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
and indeed the participants

493
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
obtained substantial benefits then the

494
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
concept of the the technology and the

495
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
concept for the clubs and the

496
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,360
club model and the and the systems that

497
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
they embody

498
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
would quite naturally spread from one

499
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
community to the next uh

500
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
if if a if a club starts in a

501
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
in say in a city just a not not as a

502
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
city but just even a small

503
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
fraction of a city that that could be a

504
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
club any

505
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
like a club could be any uh maybe

506
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,559
perhaps a thousand people or more so

507
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,480
just a subset of a city

508
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,200
could start a club and be part of this r

509
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,679
d pr

510
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,480
or the whole r d program a field trial

511
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,280
could happen

512
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,960
uh uh via a club and

513
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
if the club really does produce benefits

514
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,320
then

515
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,200
the next city over the next community

516
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,600
over

517
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
is going to have an interest in starting

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
it also because the benefits are

519
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
are substantial and at the same time a

520
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,320
club

521
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
can grow in the participation

522
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,799
participation rate in a local area could

523
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,360
grow

524
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
so clubs can grow in size and they can

525
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
replicate into new

526
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
locations and that sets the stage then

527
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
for viral growth

528
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
and that it would be how the the

529
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
societal transformation and the use of

530
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
new systems could spread to near global

531
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,480
levels

532
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
over a period of the 50-year horizon

533
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,559
so uh clubs are designed to basically uh

534
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
out compete native systems by native

535
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,840
systems i mean just the

536
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
you know the the the

537
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,400
legal economic governance systems

538
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
that we are using today

539
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,360
these new systems will obviously be

540
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
designed for a purpose and that purpose

541
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,320
is to benefit and

542
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
improve the quality of life and the

543
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
security of

544
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,200
of participants and uh if

545
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
if if they achieve that

546
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,559
they will out compete native systems for

547
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,000
the public's attention

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
engagement trust and respect so that is

549
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,240
the that is what they should do and

550
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,520
uh and if they do then then

551
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
the their use would would quite

552
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
naturally spread

553
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,760
in a viral fashion now the clubs

554
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
i just want to say about the love the

555
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
club level so we're not talking about

556
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
say a family making changes that's

557
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
like this isn't really family focused

558
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,720
the whole project

559
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
it's not really focused at the business

560
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,320
level like a particular business

561
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,960
a new a new business model for example

562
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,440
it's not

563
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
focused there and it's not focused at

564
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
the city level so a new city charter or

565
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
a new

566
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
new way the city can operate to be

567
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,200
uh to improve somehow it's situated in

568
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,480
between the city level

569
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,360
and and the kind of family slash

570
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,559
business level

571
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,840
right and i think of that as the

572
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,559
goldilocks level uh

573
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,640
if a club was smaller this i would say

574
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
this this level this in between level

575
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
the middle ground sometimes i call it is

576
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,679
a

577
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
is the smallest level of organization

578
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
that would allow a club to be viable

579
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
testable self self-replicating and

580
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
effective

581
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
so anything smaller than a the club

582
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,640
level uh

583
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,760
you could imagine say if we're just

584
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,200
talking about a business well then that

585
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
business has to compete in an

586
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,760
environment

587
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,080
against other businesses to survive and

588
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
if those other businesses are

589
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,240
you know not on the same in the same you

590
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
know doing the same thing on the same

591
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,679
program they might have advantages

592
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
that the new business model might not

593
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,799
have

594
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
at the same time if we went to a higher

595
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
model say a city level uh trying to

596
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
change things at the city level well

597
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,640
that's suddenly

598
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
uh really expensive and difficult

599
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
especially for a large city

600
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,720
so there would be a lot of political

601
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960
blowback for trying to change things

602
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,039
dramatically at the city level

603
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,200
and the club level is such that

604
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,360
that you could implement you could you

605
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
could implement new systems

606
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,480
without having to deal with uh

607
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,520
the need to to win elections

608
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
or uh uh you know get approval from any

609
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
public body right so this is

610
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
so a a thousand like-minded individuals

611
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
can just start a club

612
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,799
and no need to no need for anyone else

613
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,159
in the community to join in

614
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
they can do it all on their own just as

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
is so that's the idea

616
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,880
is to reduce the barriers to to to

617
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,760
participating

618
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,200
in a club in in new systems and uh

619
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
and have it be such that the that that

620
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
new systems could

621
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
virally spread over time if they if they

622
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,159
show their benefits

623
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,000
okay so just to make the point then when

624
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
i'm talking about societal

625
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
transformation the new designs that

626
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,760
we're coming

627
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
up with i'm talking about the designs

628
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
for a club not the designs for a city

629
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
not the designs for

630
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
a county not the designs for a state or

631
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
for a nation but i'm talking about

632
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,400
societal systems designs for a club

633
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
and the and the club will then

634
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,159
demonstrate to the world in field trials

635
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,919
whether this whether these new systems

636
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,880
work well

637
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,600
as as advertised or not

638
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
nice good point because sometimes when

639
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,919
we're talking about these complex

640
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,000
multi-scale systems it's good to make it

641
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
clear that we're talking about

642
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,039
policies affordances capacities that are

643
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,799
at a certain level of analysis we're not

644
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,240
invoking a nation state or something

645
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,880
like that

646
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,799
no we're we're doing something we're

647
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
working at what uh

648
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
a workable level you know this is

649
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,840
focused at a workable level this can

650
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,200
happen there's really no reason it

651
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,480
couldn't happen

652
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,520
and uh obviously getting the initial

653
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
funding for the project is a big deal

654
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
but once the initial funding happens i

655
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
don't see why this could not move

656
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,520
forward

657
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,880
exactly as or you know close to close to

658
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,279
what is planned here

659
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,360
um yeah next slide

660
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,919
uh is this the endgame vision 18 is that

661
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,640
where we're at

662
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,320
yep yeah okay so um

663
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,159
you know where is this all leading i've

664
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,320
already said there's a 50-year horizon

665
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,200
uh aimed at at societal transformation

666
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,960
on a near global scale

667
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
but but the real goal obviously the real

668
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,960
goal in this is

669
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
is for society's

670
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,520
humanity to to use

671
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,000
systems that are beneficial to them that

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,480
are most you know most beneficial or

673
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,679
widely beneficial to them i believe

674
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,520
that i should say there's there's good

675
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,919
reason to expect that a well-designed r

676
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,159
d

677
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
program that engages local communities

678
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,919
and the science

679
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,640
world could come up with designs that

680
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
are

681
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,279
substantially better than our current

682
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,039
ones i mean if you

683
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,320
if if the goal is to uh is to

684
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,399
increase quality of life and reduce

685
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,440
uncertainty

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
if that was how you were judging the

687
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,760
design of societal systems then i think

688
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,039
you would have to say that the current

689
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
systems are

690
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
are failing they're they're

691
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,159
terrible in the sense that we now face

692
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
uh you know enormous

693
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,480
stress and strain due to climate change

694
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
due to biodiversity loss

695
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
due to due to a host of interrelated

696
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
problems that all

697
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,279
all of which were preventable all of

698
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,640
which have been talked about in the

699
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,679
science world

700
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,440
and in other communities for the last

701
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,960
several decades

702
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,520
and all of which had we taken action we

703
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,000
would not

704
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
be under the risk that we are right now

705
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,200
so and

706
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,840
so if nato if native systems have given

707
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
us this extreme a world of extreme risk

708
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
then i think it would be fair to say

709
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,679
that native systems are failing humanity

710
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,640
and it would be hard to imagine that a

711
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
that a

712
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
sophisticated science-based effort with

713
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,960
some of the

714
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
best minds in the world you know focused

715
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,720
on this

716
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
this topic could not do far far better

717
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
than current systems so

718
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
just to connect it to one note from game

719
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,600
theory it's that the strategy has to be

720
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
resilient

721
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,960
along the way so it needs to have that

722
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,919
kind of like

723
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,760
introductory dynamics and getting off

724
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,159
the ground and bootstrapping or

725
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,080
not relying on lateral connections

726
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,000
amongst clubs it has to be sort of an

727
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
end in and of itself

728
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,640
and then it also has to be a resilient

729
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,039
uh

730
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,159
mixed strategy at 50 percent it has to

731
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:54,960
be a resilient

732
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,159
dominant strategy and so flexibility to

733
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,000
play different strategies at different

734
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
um phases of the uptake is critical

735
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,760
that's why you've laid out a timeline as

736
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,320
well

737
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
yeah yeah um and that's also

738
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
you know kind of related to that to your

739
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,279
point is that

740
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,520
there could literally be hundreds or

741
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,360
thousands of experiments going on around

742
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,279
the world in different communities of

743
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,960
of different system designs and

744
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
different asp different aspects of a

745
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
particular design

746
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,440
so the so you would want to be very

747
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,159
flexible

748
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,559
very adaptable we're learning as we go

749
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,919
as a matter of fact

750
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,320
uh and would up you know would change

751
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
the change of the strategy slightly as

752
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,440
we go and

753
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,919
change the focus slightly as we go

754
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
adjusting the circumstances

755
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
and and starting small and growing

756
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,039
organically

757
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,360
helps you to do that as opposed to

758
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,399
starting big and

759
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,760
perhaps failing big so in the end game

760
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,159
vision the idea is that in the future

761
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,240
humanity is using systems that really

762
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
serve humanity

763
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,559
uh uh as we've talked about many times

764
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:58,880
now

765
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,519
it's just um the view here is societal

766
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,519
systems as a cognitive architecture as a

767
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,640
way of

768
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,039
facilitating societal cognition and

769
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,880
obviously we would all like

770
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,960
our societies to be good at thinking

771
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,159
good at learning

772
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
good at adapting good at making

773
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,679
decisions so that we can all

774
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,799
enjoy the benefits of such so

775
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,360
the endgame vision is perhaps i mean

776
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,559
there's here's a couple of

777
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,679
scenarios for the endgame vision the r d

778
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,840
program moves forward we demonstrate

779
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,799
really

780
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
useful designs where that give

781
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,320
substantial benefits

782
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
uh to communities and the

783
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,799
existing native systems uh slowly uptake

784
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,039
those ideas and blend those ideas

785
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,000
into their into their systems and then

786
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
in the end

787
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,600
you know where you the native systems

788
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,880
become much better

789
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
so that would be great that would be

790
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
fantastic and another scenario

791
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
is that native systems fail to adjust

792
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,559
and change and up

793
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,760
uptake these new ideas they uh and if

794
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
that were the case

795
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
since the the new systems are designed

796
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,080
to

797
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
earn the public's trust and respect and

798
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,360
attention

799
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,080
um they would it would seem reasonable

800
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,519
that they would out compete native

801
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,399
systems for the

802
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,720
for the public's trust and respect and

803
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,559
if that's the case then

804
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,480
you know people would be using these new

805
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,559
systems and relying on them

806
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,880
more so than native systems so those are

807
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,399
just two scenarios but you could

808
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,399
you could imagine any num you know a

809
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,679
number of other scenarios that might

810
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,080
occur

811
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
from such an r d program but uh the

812
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,799
either way at least with these two

813
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,960
scenarios either way the end goal is

814
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,679
reached of

815
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,640
of of you know a large majority of the

816
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,679
human population

817
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,120
using systems that actually serve them

818
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,000
and serve them well

819
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
slide 19 yep

820
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,158
okay so a little bit more in clubs

821
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
so by the by the time the first field

822
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
trial occurs in the first

823
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,039
system and this could you know

824
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,360
potentially uh the field trial

825
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
the first field trial could occur maybe

826
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,440
anywhere in the world practically

827
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
but by the time the community

828
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,919
participates in a first field trial it

829
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,600
should be really clear

830
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,080
what the expected outcome is right a

831
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,919
community does drive its systems a

832
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
community makes decisions day to day

833
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,159
the of of what you know what kind of uh

834
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,120
you know about services about waste

835
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
control about

836
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
energy generation about all kinds of

837
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
things a community makes its own

838
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,640
decisions

839
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,320
but the general trajectory

840
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,039
towards uh improved quality of life

841
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,080
improved well-being

842
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,159
improved security improved economic

843
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,360
security

844
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,880
uh reduced income inequality

845
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
like all of those things

846
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,799
there should be very few surprises as to

847
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,480
what occurs in a field trial it should

848
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,519
be

849
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,440
there would have already been numerous

850
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
simulations that would have occurred

851
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,679
before

852
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,679
uh before our first trial first field

853
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,600
trial already uh

854
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
before it even begins there would have

855
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
been all kinds of

856
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,639
user testing that would have occurred

857
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
there would be all kinds of game playing

858
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,760
with new systems that would have

859
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,639
occurred

860
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,800
so by the time the first field trial

861
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
starts this should be a

862
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,560
you know this should be a trajectory of

863
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
exactly what

864
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,079
is uh what is predicted and so there

865
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,359
should be few surprises

866
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,599
for the field trials now obviously that

867
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,639
doesn't mean that something

868
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,079
you know there might not be hiccups or

869
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
whatever but by and large

870
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,440
there should be very few surprises the

871
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
community should know really what

872
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,280
what they're getting into how the system

873
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,159
operates

874
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,879
and what the expected benefits are in

875
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,399
each year of participation

876
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,440
second item is that that

877
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,560
while the initial field trials might be

878
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
really focused at the individual club

879
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,679
level as the

880
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,480
r d program progresses there would be an

881
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,280
effort to

882
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,040
connect clubs via networks so that

883
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,119
clubs themselves are participating in

884
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,800
some kind of cognitive

885
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,480
uh operation um cl as a community of

886
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
clubs that also needs to make decisions

887
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
to learn to adapt

888
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,520
uh to make decisions together so

889
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,720
the the idea is that some of the same

890
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
kind of approaches and technologies that

891
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
are implemented at the club level

892
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,040
could also be implemented at the network

893
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
level

894
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,359
so that the entire uh the entire

895
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,560
you know range of clubs and the

896
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
individuals within clubs could all be

897
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,040
um participating in some kind of

898
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
optimal cognitive system right making

899
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
good decisions and look

900
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,640
and and opportunities for learning

901
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,560
uh next slide

902
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,079
um so why why why

903
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,320
why the why the club model uh i've

904
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,760
already mentioned a few things

905
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
uh it's in the goldilocks level that

906
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,160
allows for replication and and and viral

907
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,119
spread

908
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,480
but there's a few other uh advantages

909
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,079
that i would like to mention

910
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
um first we're talking about when you

911
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,480
think about bold change revolut violent

912
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,200
revolution

913
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
is one kind of bold change so we

914
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,040
obviously are not talking about

915
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
revolution we're not talking about any

916
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
kind of violence whatsoever

917
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
we're talking about improving the

918
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
well-being of communities at every step

919
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,640
along the process

920
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,760
so this is non-violent and that's one

921
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
part another part is that success is

922
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,280
measured

923
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,599
and success and progress are measured

924
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,560
throughout the

925
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
throughout the process so not only might

926
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,599
you be doing better

927
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,400
but that would that would be validated

928
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,040
the

929
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,359
through a variety of metrics you know

930
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,079
there would be

931
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,680
this is an experiment you know this is

932
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,480
the science world is engaged in this

933
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,400
ongoing experiment to develop new

934
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
systems so data would be gathered

935
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
and you and everyone would know that

936
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
you're doing better if you're doing

937
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,599
better right

938
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
that we would know if they're working or

939
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,040
not maybe that's a better way to say it

940
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,440
fitness the evaluation of system fitness

941
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,240
and the

942
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,839
quality of life for community are

943
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,520
central to this whole

944
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,560
project again

945
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,040
because the clubs are operating in that

946
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
middle ground

947
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
there's that minimizes political

948
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
opposition opposition

949
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,560
there's as i said any group can join a

950
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
it can form a club so that you don't

951
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
need a city's approval for this you

952
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
don't need a nation's approval for this

953
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,280
is this is just a a civic club so a

954
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,040
civic club can start nearly anywhere in

955
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,480
most countries or most democratic

956
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
countries

957
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,880
and so you don't need a you don't need a

958
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,280
vote and the re this is really important

959
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
because

960
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,760
i am i am speaking to the global science

961
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,400
community

962
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,960
here and i'm inviting the the global

963
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
science community to participate but i

964
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
don't expect that everyone

965
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
all scientists will will be interested

966
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,720
in this nor do i expect that all

967
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,560
individuals in the general population

968
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
would be interested in in participating

969
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
in a field trial or

970
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
or anything like that as a matter of

971
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
fact i would expect that most

972
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,720
most people you know most people in any

973
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,599
given city

974
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,480
will have no interest in this at all but

975
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,079
that doesn't matter

976
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,599
because again all it takes is a thousand

977
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,079
people

978
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,359
in in your city or your area to start a

979
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,400
club

980
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
that club shows benefits it quickly

981
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,200
becomes clear to others that this is a

982
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,440
this is a very useful uh

983
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
this is a very useful program incomes

984
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,720
are rising

985
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,440
incomes are stabilizing quality of life

986
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,520
is improving

987
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,880
the club feels more

988
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,359
empowered to make decisions that affect

989
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,839
its that affect its future

990
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,079
the there's a stronger sense of

991
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,200
community

992
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,320
um there's the ability to to a better

993
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,480
ability to deal with problems as they

994
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,440
arise and find

995
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
long lasting solutions so on

996
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,359
on numerous levels quality of life and

997
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,000
environmental

998
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,520
quality should increase information

999
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
should increase

1000
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
transparency transparency should

1001
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
increase democratic participation should

1002
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,680
increase

1003
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
and those are all really you know

1004
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,440
attractive

1005
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,839
attractive characteristics if if indeed

1006
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,800
a the club

1007
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
model provides that so uh

1008
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,359
if that's the benefits then then again

1009
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,160
the there's the idea will spread from

1010
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
one community to the next and grow

1011
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,720
within

1012
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,119
different communities and it's not

1013
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,040
necessary that

1014
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,520
that that a large percent of the

1015
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,480
population

1016
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
jumps on board on day one it's just it's

1017
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,760
just not necessary

1018
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
there must be i i would argue that even

1019
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,079
today if we looked around

1020
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,079
looked around there would be a community

1021
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,520
of a thousand people who would be

1022
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,280
interested in participating in a field

1023
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,160
trial

1024
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,000
and the first field trial of course is

1025
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,599
still some years away

1026
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,839
the program isn't even funded yet so by

1027
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,599
the time we get to the point where we

1028
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,200
really need a community to

1029
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,680
run a field trial i i imagine there that

1030
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,839
will be quite easy

1031
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,119
as a matter of fact i would expect

1032
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,680
numerous communities to offer themselves

1033
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,599
as participants for the first field

1034
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,440
trials

1035
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,400
um this just a few more points here but

1036
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,720
uh

1037
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,160
the city whoever in in whatever city the

1038
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,839
first field trials occur they're likely

1039
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,319
to have beneficial spillover effects so

1040
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,880
uh you know tax revenues might rise for

1041
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,599
example

1042
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,880
uh other other spillover effects from

1043
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,839
the club

1044
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,520
might help the city at large so

1045
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,200
you know maybe even cities would welcome

1046
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,440
such a thing if it's going to improve

1047
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
the quality of civic life

1048
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,280
uh for those who partici for those who

1049
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,640
participate and for those who don't

1050
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
participate

1051
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,240
um and this this club model is opposed

1052
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,560
to

1053
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,160
say going big to changing the for

1054
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,040
example the u.s

1055
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,359
economic system or the global economic

1056
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,240
system on

1057
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
you know in a on day one or in a short

1058
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
amount of time

1059
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
this uh this local global viral strategy

1060
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,680
is far less cost

1061
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,839
costly far less risky and far more

1062
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,119
flexible we're talking about

1063
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,280
starting small bootstrapping or growing

1064
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,480
organically

1065
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,000
and that all can be done on a

1066
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,040
on a practical budget as we'll talk

1067
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,520
about

1068
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,560
shortly and a lot and as i mentioned it

1069
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,240
allows for parallel testing

1070
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,440
uh so numerous field trials in numerous

1071
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,960
countries and or cities could be

1072
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,880
happening all the same time

1073
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
and as far as cost goes what you know

1074
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,160
what would be the cost well it's a

1075
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,839
little hard to say because the program

1076
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,640
isn't really

1077
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,359
developed yet so but this is just a kind

1078
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,359
of a guess on my part

1079
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,839
but i'm i would think that in the first

1080
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,119
few years

1081
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,960
the cost might be less than 10 million

1082
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
dollars a year to get this started

1083
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,440
and then in in sub subsequent years

1084
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
still in the first decade

1085
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
the cost might be on the order of tens

1086
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
of millions of dollars

1087
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,319
now that is you know in a certain in a

1088
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,839
certain sense that's a lot of money but

1089
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,800
in

1090
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,319
in a certain world that's a lot of money

1091
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,400
but in another world that's peanuts

1092
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,280
so this is not this is about the same

1093
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,480
cost as a

1094
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
modest size or a good size startup uh

1095
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,079
you know

1096
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,720
so that this level of funding is

1097
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,440
available

1098
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,800
in the world uh it's this is not a crazy

1099
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,359
cost

1100
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,560
and uh i i argue that

1101
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,240
you know with this modest cost we could

1102
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
really change the direct trajectory of

1103
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,959
humanity here

1104
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,640
okay that's it for part two

1105
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,480
oh that's it for part two okay all right

1106
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,680
so uh so

1107
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,880
we have we will continue this uh talk

1108
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
about part two in our next

1109
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,760
jam board so i'll add the new link and

1110
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,640
we're now on

1111
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,440
slide two of jamboard three okay all

1112
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,640
right good

1113
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,680
um uh so the slide two

1114
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,079
is uh is just where you can go for more

1115
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,200
information so

1116
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,400
if you'd like to know more about the

1117
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
proposed program if you would like links

1118
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,000
to all the articles

1119
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,079
and links to all the previous videos

1120
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,520
that we've made

1121
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,880
and that i've been involved with you can

1122
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,860
find them all on

1123
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,400
[Music]

1124
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
principledsocietiesproject.org

1125
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,240
all right slide three um so there's a

1126
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
few remaining topics from uh part two

1127
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,240
that i'll talk about now

1128
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
um some opportunities outside of clubs

1129
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,520
uh

1130
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
a little bit about fitness metrics and

1131
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,119
then some final thoughts on part two

1132
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,920
yep so we've already talked about

1133
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,599
opportunities in clubs which could

1134
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,960
include for example

1135
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,319
increased income um and uh

1136
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,079
higher quality of life and a bunch of

1137
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,839
other

1138
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,119
material benefits material and social

1139
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,240
benefits

1140
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,640
but there's also some opportunities that

1141
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,880
could occur for those outside clubs

1142
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,280
and as i mentioned clubs sit at the

1143
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,160
midway level

1144
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,319
between the kind of family slash

1145
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,200
business level

1146
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,319
and the city level and both of those

1147
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,520
levels are already well developed and

1148
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,680
you know there's an enormous amount of

1149
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,560
revenue attached to both of those levels

1150
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,960
the middle ground is not yet organized

1151
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
but as it organizes i would imagine that

1152
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,040
revenue opportunities are you know

1153
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,160
similar to those at the city level and

1154
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,119
those at the

1155
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,040
at the family slash business level

1156
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,480
so uh the i the the the

1157
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,960
the r d program would help to do to

1158
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,880
organize this middle ground the club

1159
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,520
level

1160
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,119
and some of those there's a little bit

1161
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,720
of evidence that that such

1162
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,560
organization is already happening for

1163
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,359
for example uh is it called

1164
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,520
what is the app called the neighborhood

1165
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,640
app

1166
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,960
it's the name escapes me right now but

1167
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,000
there's a

1168
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,359
there's an app that is widely used and

1169
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,079
is used by millions of people in the us

1170
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:04,960
at least

1171
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
about communicating within your

1172
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,920
neighborhood and sharing information

1173
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,880
within your neighborhood

1174
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,119
right so that's already a big business

1175
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,240
that that app alone is a big business

1176
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
cities are also developing community

1177
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,720
energy supplies community solar

1178
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
and that's just another way that this

1179
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,160
middle ground is is organizing

1180
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,720
and if the r d programs goes forward

1181
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,079
there would be a

1182
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,839
tremendous amount of organization

1183
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,760
happening within this middle ground

1184
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,079
so that opens up opportunities for

1185
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,160
consultants for example

1186
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,400
most of the work and developing the r d

1187
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,000
pro program the

1188
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,920
the tools and technologies needed for

1189
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,160
field trials for new systems

1190
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,280
that would mostly be open source

1191
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,079
you know publicly available uh knowledge

1192
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,720
and and

1193
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,720
information but it could be that

1194
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,000
that businesses

1195
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,440
consulting businesses or other

1196
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,520
businesses could provide services to

1197
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,440
new clubs could provide these could be

1198
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
training services they could be

1199
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,839
you know like internet services or any

1200
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,000
other kinds of services that would help

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,280
clubs get started and uh i imagine that

1202
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,240
could be a

1203
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,960
big business as we're as we're as this

1204
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,720
moves forward

1205
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
maybe a good model for that is red hat

1206
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,640
incorporated which uh

1207
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,760
which uh provides services related to

1208
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,440
the linux operating system provide

1209
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,359
services to businesses

1210
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,440
related to linux linux itself is an open

1211
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,560
source product or

1212
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,760
it's open source technology and

1213
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
red hat which is a enormous company

1214
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,920
i don't know if it's a i see a billion

1215
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,160
dollars in tax revenues recently so

1216
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
this is a very very large company

1217
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
operating on top of an open source stack

1218
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,040
in a sense and the same could be uh the

1219
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,640
same operation similar opportunities

1220
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,599
could occur for

1221
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,400
for for businesses who want to work in

1222
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,920
this consulting or service

1223
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,359
providing space another opportunity is

1224
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,280
for cities and other governments

1225
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,480
because of tax revenues later

1226
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,079
in i don't know if we'll get to it in

1227
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,680
the next session but

1228
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,960
maybe in the in the next next session

1229
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
section of these discussions we'll get

1230
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
to the uh the simulation model that i

1231
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,599
published on

1232
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,559
what i call the the lita framework local

1233
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,000
economic direct democracy

1234
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
association framework uh that is that is

1235
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,520
that simulation is just illustrative of

1236
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,480
a potential uh kind of a prototype new

1237
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,280
um

1238
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
societal design uh focused on the

1239
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,319
economy focused on an economic system

1240
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,960
but in the simulation that occurred the

1241
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,720
simulation was for eugene oregon

1242
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,520
using data census data for eugene oregon

1243
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,400
and uh

1244
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,040
the simulation occurred over a 28-year

1245
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,119
period but by the end of that 28-year

1246
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,160
period

1247
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,359
um let's see i

1248
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,240
headed down there just a few words about

1249
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,680
what that provided but

1250
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,000
um

1251
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,520
billion in tax rate right right which

1252
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,960
was more than double the initial tax

1253
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,000
revenue so

1254
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,400
potentially this is a you know could be

1255
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,079
in a sense kind of a windfall

1256
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,880
for uh local governments city

1257
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,480
governments and community governments

1258
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,400
uh for for tax revenues

1259
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,920
and then finally there's an opportunity

1260
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,839
for large investors and that uh

1261
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,440
you know we are looking at a future

1262
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,960
world that is going to be

1263
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,000
very stressful because of the the

1264
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,440
implications of climate change the

1265
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,280
effects of climate change uh

1266
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,960
biodiversity loss and

1267
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,119
social other social environmental

1268
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,400
problems

1269
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,319
so if it happens that uh

1270
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,760
that there's a shortage of good

1271
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,160
investments to protect your money

1272
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,640
the club model and the club process and

1273
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,200
the r d

1274
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,800
program might become they might be seen

1275
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,520
as safe havens for parking money until

1276
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,480
things

1277
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,359
uh you know improve and if that's the

1278
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,079
case

1279
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,240
i could imagine that some institutional

1280
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,200
investors who

1281
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,359
who desire to make social investments or

1282
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,240
who see the

1283
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,319
wisdom of making social investments

1284
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,640
could invest in this whole

1285
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,800
process and of course that would provide

1286
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
funds for

1287
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,280
developing the developing the club model

1288
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,920
and

1289
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,520
helping the club model to spread and um

1290
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,440
and grow um

1291
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,319
yeah who knows who knows what is going

1292
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,160
to happen in the stock market as

1293
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,480
clim the ravages of climate change

1294
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,160
approaches

1295
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,440
and maybe the maybe this maybe this club

1296
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
model idea could really actually help

1297
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,640
large investors by

1298
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,440
providing a safe haven uh for their

1299
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,040
investments

1300
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,880
and i'm talking social investments i'm

1301
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,319
not talking um

1302
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,480
highly profitable investments that some

1303
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,079
might be used to but i'm talking about

1304
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,559
uh social investments where it's

1305
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,720
invested in a low expectation of

1306
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,279
a profit

1307
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,520
okay slide five

1308
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,240
that's cool uh okay so just a little bit

1309
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:08,720
on

1310
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,880
fitness metrics we've been mentioning

1311
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,000
them all through

1312
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,800
these talks i just wanted to say that

1313
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,280
they serve several purposes

1314
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,559
for example they are they are this

1315
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,400
fitness metrics the information gathered

1316
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,040
about fitness metrics so for example

1317
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
just to name a few fitness metrics you

1318
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,559
know could be uh

1319
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,240
family income could be education levels

1320
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,119
it could be

1321
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,520
water quality air quality i mean you

1322
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,960
name it that would be

1323
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,839
you know potentially uh hundreds or

1324
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,119
thousands of

1325
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,520
of of topics to collect information on

1326
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,640
so this in this information could help a

1327
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,319
club assess its own status

1328
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,800
how am i do how are we doing you know we

1329
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,480
need information to answer that question

1330
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,559
how are we doing well we can say that

1331
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,200
we are doing blank you know we're doing

1332
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,480
so well or

1333
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
so poorly or whatever the case may be on

1334
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,800
education on environmental

1335
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,760
quality on economic security on all

1336
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,000
these

1337
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,440
different issues um second is

1338
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,599
this information helps clubs to solve

1339
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,280
problems

1340
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
we have for example the

1341
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,720
how do we how do we maybe the problem is

1342
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,599
focused on economic security how do how

1343
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,440
do we solve this economic security

1344
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,280
problem well we need information we need

1345
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,160
to know

1346
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
uh how we're doing right now how are we

1347
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,359
doing last year

1348
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,960
so that we can know we can make good

1349
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
decisions for solving these problems

1350
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,079
that we're facing right now

1351
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,240
metrics are also useful for assessing

1352
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,680
club and system design

1353
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,839
again clubs are built for purpose and

1354
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,520
are supposed to function

1355
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,000
successfully for purpose and achieve the

1356
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,480
aims that they were designed to achieve

1357
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,599
and all of that to assess club fitness

1358
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,160
and to

1359
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,319
to assess how a club how a club design

1360
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,960
is doing requires information

1361
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
another use of information is just

1362
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,559
informing members so

1363
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,559
everyone has questions about you know

1364
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,640
just day-to-day questions in their life

1365
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
you know what career should i choose or

1366
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,640
or you know

1367
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,960
what where is it where can i buy fresh

1368
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,040
strawberries today or whatever

1369
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,960
you know whatever information that

1370
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,559
individuals need in living their

1371
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,000
day-to-day lives and running their

1372
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,319
businesses day-to-day

1373
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,480
the information gathered by a club could

1374
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,000
help them to make better

1375
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,520
decisions just in their own personal

1376
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,200
life

1377
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,920
and then lastly the data assessed would

1378
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
just be a windfall for basics

1379
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,160
basic and applied science this were you

1380
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,839
know in a sense we're talking about a

1381
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,400
repository a a large repository of

1382
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
longitudinal information that follows

1383
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
individuals and families and businesses

1384
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,000
through their life and uh and how their

1385
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
how they're doing their quality of life

1386
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,400
as as decisions are made and as the

1387
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,040
as the as the club makes decisions as

1388
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,200
they make individual decisions

1389
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,920
um that information would just be gold

1390
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,800
for

1391
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,960
understanding uh you know societies

1392
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,559
better understanding clubs better

1393
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,839
understanding health better

1394
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,960
you know than that information there's

1395
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,240
only a few small

1396
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,720
repositories like that today so we're

1397
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,839
talking about just

1398
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,200
a really a gold mine for for science and

1399
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,280
a basic science and applied science if

1400
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,960
this moves forward

1401
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,880
obviously there would be you know

1402
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,559
personal you'd have to protect personal

1403
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,000
data in all of this but

1404
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,040
that could be done and just a few words

1405
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,800
about how this

1406
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,960
these fitness metrics and data this data

1407
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,319
gathering system

1408
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,760
would be different from what's already

1409
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,440
done well you know

1410
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,440
already for example the census collects

1411
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,559
information

1412
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,960
and the sustainable development goals

1413
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,760
sdgs

1414
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,920
uh are proposing a you know a collection

1415
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,040
of data at

1416
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,000
the national level um that would be and

1417
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,359
all of the all of that data for the

1418
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,119
census and for sdgs

1419
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,200
it touches on some of the same topics

1420
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,400
like quality of life

1421
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,599
and education and economics and so some

1422
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,160
of the

1423
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,359
large topics are similar but the

1424
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,880
but there would be many many differences

1425
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,640
between this kind of data collection

1426
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,400
and uh and the existing programs

1427
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,359
so just a few differences this would be

1428
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,040
a larger and more detailed set of

1429
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,920
information

1430
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,680
it'd be collected and managed at the

1431
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,200
community level not at the national

1432
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,839
level

1433
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,680
it would be about local conditions so

1434
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,520
specific for local conditions rather

1435
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,599
than say national conditions

1436
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,440
forecasting other kinds of models are

1437
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,760
integrated into this repository so this

1438
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,720
would be a you know

1439
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
an intelligent uh the aim is here an

1440
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,520
intelligent data gathering system

1441
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,280
it would be part of uh you know

1442
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,559
forecasting

1443
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,839
metrics into the future and things like

1444
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,480
that uh

1445
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,200
and the obviously the club is designed

1446
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,599
to

1447
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,599
to serve a different set of purposes and

1448
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,280
in particular purposes related to

1449
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,160
community cognition societal cognition

1450
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,920
lastly clubs would collect information

1451
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,760
on a far more frequent basis so

1452
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,960
uh you know some some survey questions

1453
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,160
are asked every

1454
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,559
few years sometimes sometimes every year

1455
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,000
sometimes every few years sometimes

1456
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,920
every five years

1457
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,920
and the sdgs i think are collected

1458
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,599
mostly on a

1459
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,839
annual basis so uh this is on a perhaps

1460
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,440
you know some some data would be

1461
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,040
gathered minute to minute or hour to

1462
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,079
hour or

1463
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,040
day to day so there would be a far

1464
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,040
richer

1465
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,960
and higher quality data set that would

1466
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,200
be

1467
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,599
that communities would generate yeah and

1468
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,520
the basic idea is the community needs to

1469
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,119
know what's going to happen to me like a

1470
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,200
community needs to know what's going on

1471
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,880
where did we come from what's going on

1472
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
where are we headed what should we do

1473
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,799
and to answer those kinds of questions

1474
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,160
requires rich data

1475
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,680
and that's exactly what would be

1476
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,079
proposed here community could

1477
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,079
collect rich data about itself so it

1478
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,760
would know how it's doing

1479
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,559
and what's going to happen if i could

1480
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,480
also add one comment there

1481
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,799
with active inference type models we can

1482
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,839
have a rich

1483
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,280
uh or deep generative model even if we

1484
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,760
have sparse data collection initially

1485
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,359
and then we can ask what kinds of

1486
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,040
collection of what type of data or what

1487
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,440
type of modeling or what perturbation

1488
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,040
would make sense given our generative

1489
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,960
model or how can we differentiate

1490
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,680
between two

1491
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,240
generative models or two hypotheses at

1492
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,799
play

1493
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,040
so the richness can be specified up

1494
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,960
front we don't need to just grab what we

1495
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,799
can see in terms of data we can actually

1496
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,400
be principled in terms of what

1497
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,839
information is pursued

1498
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,720
yeah yeah yeah as we've already said

1499
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,440
part of the

1500
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,599
the concept behind active inference is

1501
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,520
decision making under uncertainty and

1502
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,400
obviously

1503
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,240
we're talking about a community that

1504
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,760
doesn't know its future

1505
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,200
and isn't sure what's going to happen

1506
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
next because no community

1507
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,520
understands its future very well and and

1508
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,440
especially in today's world is very

1509
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,000
uncertain

1510
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,680
about what's going to happen next will

1511
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,280
there be enough food for

1512
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,839
us next year will there be enough clean

1513
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,520
water for us next year

1514
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,040
i mean these are some big questions but

1515
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,200
there's a million little questions

1516
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,079
and so somehow a community has to make

1517
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,920
decisions under uncertainty and that's

1518
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,319
really

1519
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,839
you know what the point of active

1520
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,240
inference is is how that can occur

1521
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,240
um and and then you uh touching a point

1522
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,680
that you just raised

1523
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,119
daniel is is uh

1524
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,079
you know active inference is a is a is a

1525
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,839
is a

1526
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,960
is a way to make steps

1527
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,359
in cognition right it's a flow of

1528
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,319
information

1529
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,799
processing decision making action

1530
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,880
information flow decision making action

1531
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,760
so

1532
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,799
it naturally lends itself to an ongoing

1533
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,839
process of learning

1534
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,000
and also a multi-scale one so there's a

1535
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,359
multi-scale learning here just like you

1536
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:54,079
said some are

1537
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,559
one-year questions one day one hour

1538
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,240
there's multiple ticks to these models

1539
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,040
that we've seen

1540
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,119
nested models at different time scales

1541
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,079
cool right right right

1542
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,920
i also want to mention too is when you

1543
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,520
know when we talk about models sometimes

1544
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,880
we might be thinking

1545
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
compute say computer models and that's

1546
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,400
fine you know computer miles

1547
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,599
computer models can extend the the

1548
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
intellect it's extension of the human

1549
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,280
capacity for processing information

1550
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,920
but you can imagine too that individuals

1551
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,400
can

1552
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,280
individuals do process information they

1553
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,079
they learn

1554
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,559
themselves about their world and what

1555
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,400
might happen next and what they expect

1556
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,920
if certain decisions are made

1557
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,040
so you know part of part of

1558
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,280
the flow of information and the process

1559
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
of processing of information at the club

1560
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,319
level is

1561
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,359
is to ask people what they think will

1562
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:43,839
happen

1563
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,000
if we do this what do you think will

1564
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,280
happen if we

1565
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,319
enact this rule or you know

1566
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,000
put our put our uh funding priorities

1567
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,400
over on this topic uh what you know what

1568
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,000
it what is going to happen if we do that

1569
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,440
what's going to happen tomorrow what's

1570
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,319
going to happen

1571
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,319
next year what's going to happen to my

1572
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,240
grandchildren if we make this decision

1573
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,880
today

1574
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,040
i mean these are questions that humans

1575
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,160
can can

1576
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,760
take a stab at you know can answer in

1577
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,000
their to the best of their abilities

1578
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
and we might also imagine that certain

1579
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,400
humans are quite good at it

1580
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
uh you know just because certain that we

1581
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,559
all have talents in different areas

1582
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,440
so uh you know this is not just about

1583
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,680
logic and computer models this is also

1584
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,119
about engaging the

1585
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,760
human spirit and the human heart in in

1586
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,319
in directing uh

1587
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,240
path towards a better future and making

1588
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,400
decisions that lead to a better future

1589
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,160
both both in the near term and in the

1590
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,559
long term

1591
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,799
nice

1592
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,319
all right so some final thoughts to part

1593
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,599
two

1594
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,640
um uh i've i've already mentioned

1595
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,799
that it seems already that there's

1596
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,559
enough public support for this

1597
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,480
because it doesn't require a lot of

1598
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,400
public support to get off the ground

1599
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,200
again just uh you know as far as the

1600
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,720
science community goes i imagine this

1601
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,000
could move forward if just

1602
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,480
uh you know dozens or a hundred or

1603
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
something like that scientists were

1604
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,440
really interested in this topic i

1605
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,200
imagine it could get started

1606
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,280
and if just one community somewhere in

1607
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,880
the world is interested in

1608
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,720
perhaps doing a field trial of any new

1609
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,319
system once it's developed i mean that's

1610
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,680
that's really enough

1611
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,040
so we're talking about a tiny fraction

1612
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,880
of the world population that would have

1613
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,480
to be involved in this to get it off the

1614
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,280
ground

1615
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,119
and just like any new technology uh

1616
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,160
the iphone or you know like like it

1617
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,799
doesn't

1618
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,440
it once you build it and you demonstrate

1619
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,400
that it works

1620
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,480
and it brings it reduces people's

1621
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,240
uncertainty about what's going to happen

1622
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,839
next and it empowers them to make

1623
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:46,720
decisions

1624
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,720
that improve their quality of life and

1625
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,839
and improve their security going forward

1626
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,000
then um you know the rest is history i

1627
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,079
think that's that's how i imagine this

1628
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,920
would work out is you just demonstrate a

1629
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,119
better way

1630
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,119
and it has such benefits that it just it

1631
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,160
just spreads

1632
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,799
so to get it off the ground just a

1633
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,960
fraction of the world

1634
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
would need to be involved the fraction

1635
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,000
of the population or a fraction

1636
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,160
of the of the of the global science

1637
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,440
community

1638
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,040
but but once it gets rolling then i

1639
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,480
think people will actually jump out of

1640
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,240
the woodwork to be a part of this

1641
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,880
because it's

1642
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
like who doesn't want a better world

1643
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,400
that is demonstratively

1644
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,720
better than what we had what we have now

1645
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,520
all right so one other uh so there seems

1646
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,240
to be enough

1647
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,480
support there's there's groups uh

1648
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,480
various groups working on similar kinds

1649
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,119
of uh

1650
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,680
you know topics about say for example

1651
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,040
transformation and other

1652
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,280
topics like that so i it's hard for me

1653
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,160
to imagine that

1654
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,520
that there wouldn't be enough support to

1655
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,440
move this forward if there were funding

1656
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,680
funding obviously is the is the big

1657
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,079
thing to get over right away but

1658
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,520
if there were funding i think this would

1659
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,359
go fine uh another

1660
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,280
another question mark i have at the

1661
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,480
bottom is

1662
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,839
you know it's a good question would

1663
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,760
transformation actually be easier than

1664
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,559
reform

1665
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,480
i mean in free form you're asking people

1666
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,160
you're asking corporations for example

1667
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,240
large corporations to change their

1668
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,799
behavior even to change how they measure

1669
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,000
success of their

1670
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,079
endeavors for example by including more

1671
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,200
social

1672
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,599
metrics in addition to just revenue

1673
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,200
metrics

1674
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,400
you're asking power you're as we'll talk

1675
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,799
about

1676
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,440
soon enough you're also asking people

1677
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,480
those with

1678
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,720
those with concentrated power to

1679
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,559
distribute that power to the rest of the

1680
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,599
world

1681
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,839
and uh you know you're this is a big ask

1682
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,079
your reform requires some

1683
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,280
big actions by big players

1684
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,960
and that's great i mean reform is

1685
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,039
absolutely necessary and every effort

1686
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,960
should be made to move reform forward

1687
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,760
it's it's we won't we might not survive

1688
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,440
without reform

1689
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,119
it's especially good for the short term

1690
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,559
to get things uh

1691
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,799
you know improve conditions and improve

1692
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,559
our trajectory in the short term

1693
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,319
but in the long term transformation is

1694
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,160
necessary

1695
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,640
can i ask a question yeah um you

1696
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,559
mentioned funding being a rate limiting

1697
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,319
step so what would you spend

1698
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,160
money on oh as well as a couple slides

1699
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,000
ago i mentioned that it might cost about

1700
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,400
uh

1701
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,119
whatever maybe less than 10 million or

1702
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,720
around 10 million a year for the first

1703
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,680
few years

1704
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,240
but there has to be you know a variety

1705
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,599
of things would have to happen just to

1706
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,799
get the program going you know there

1707
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,400
would have to be conferences that would

1708
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,599
have to be

1709
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,839
some kind of staff to handle the you

1710
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,119
know the

1711
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,160
the program that would have to be

1712
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,280
you know some early studies done like

1713
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:35,920
the first

1714
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,760
studies would have to be funded a lot of

1715
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,960
the funding would actually just go

1716
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,240
towards studies

1717
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,400
but uh studies about what the public's

1718
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,319
opinion of transformation is what the

1719
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:44,720
you know

1720
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
what how transform how the idea of

1721
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,039
transformation is seen for example

1722
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,559
um simulation studies of

1723
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,640
potential to showing potential benefits

1724
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,720
like there would just there would be a

1725
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,880
slew of work that would have to occur

1726
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,839
and and

1727
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:00,880
we're talking about work by

1728
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,720
professionals of scientists and

1729
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,839
otherwise

1730
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,799
uh and uh you know that that just costs

1731
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:07,359
money

1732
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,039
the 10 million is actually not much so

1733
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,720
it's a small that's a small

1734
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,200
team to get things off the ground and it

1735
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,880
would cost about that

1736
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,039
there could also be funding for arts

1737
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,480
projects funding for

1738
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,640
literature funding for stories about

1739
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,039
what a transformed world would look like

1740
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,480
still you know works to to to

1741
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,119
bring the idea of the potential like the

1742
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,559
potential of trent

1743
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,319
to tell the public that we actually can

1744
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,760
there's a path we can

1745
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,760
transform we could we could live under

1746
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,960
different systems

1747
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,160
and what would that be like what would

1748
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,599
that look like what would that feel like

1749
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,559
what would we

1750
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,319
you know how would that be you know

1751
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,240
that's like a it would be

1752
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,240
lots of art things and music things and

1753
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,520
literature things and

1754
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,839
media things that could support that in

1755
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:50,880
addition to all the

1756
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,680
science-based uh efforts so i don't

1757
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,839
think

1758
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,119
you know there's there would be a few

1759
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,240
things you could do without funding

1760
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,839
there could be maybe a few studies that

1761
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,200
you could kind of squeak by

1762
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,599
and the spare funds or something but

1763
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,720
without without

1764
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,240
substantial funding this i don't think

1765
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,559
this would really go too far too fast

1766
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,079
all right all right well that brings us

1767
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:12,960
to

1768
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,880
our our real topic part three

1769
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,240
nice uh

1770
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,480
so part three is focused on on design

1771
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,920
and when i say design

1772
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,240
i mean high level design concepts not

1773
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,000
not nitty gritty how would you do this

1774
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,440
how would you do that but

1775
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,960
high level design there's a few things

1776
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,799
that i talk about in this paper the the

1777
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,039
paper itself is a narrative on the

1778
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,520
topic of de novo design you know

1779
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,640
designed from scratch

1780
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,400
of new systems um obviously as we've

1781
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:42,720
said

1782
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,799
many times now the society is views it

1783
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,359
as a super organism and its societal

1784
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,760
systems as a cognitive architecture

1785
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,000
so in that sense the goal of design is

1786
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,440
to facilitate

1787
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,720
cognitive societal cognition through a

1788
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,839
through a better architecture i

1789
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:04,000
i talk i i spend time on a few topics in

1790
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,119
this paper

1791
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,440
an attention communication self-identity

1792
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,240
power

1793
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,039
and influence are all discussed and uh i

1794
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,359
also talk about uh prototypical

1795
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,839
uh societal system design the this is

1796
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:16,720
the leader

1797
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,079
framework that i mentioned just a minute

1798
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,000
ago i don't think we're going to

1799
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,760
get to the leader frame i'm sure we

1800
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,599
won't get to the leader framework today

1801
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,039
and there's a lot to say about that

1802
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,039
because that is

1803
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,119
as far as i understand is still the

1804
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,319
first simulation

1805
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,640
in the science literature about how an

1806
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,839
integrated system

1807
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,559
might function so there's much to say

1808
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,680
about that

1809
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,599
uh and and i don't mean to say that it

1810
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,039
uh you know the whole

1811
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,400
the whole r d program is aimed at the

1812
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:44,720
lead

1813
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,640
infrastructure it's not a leader

1814
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,000
framework it's not but

1815
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,319
the the those concepts could be useful

1816
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,200
in

1817
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
developing other ideas for societal

1818
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,720
systems

1819
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,079
and at the very end of the paper i

1820
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,240
highlight some design considerations

1821
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,400
so we'll get to those maybe in two at

1822
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,559
least two sessions two or more sessions

1823
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,640
here

1824
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,720
cool slide eight yep okay so um

1825
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,880
i just wanted to say a few more words

1826
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,160
about you know

1827
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,599
reform versus transformation so uh there

1828
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,799
as i mentioned there are loud voices

1829
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,440
at the u.n and even in governments

1830
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,799
national government state governments

1831
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:23,920
local governments

1832
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,680
and certainly in the general public and

1833
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,280
certainly in the science community

1834
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,799
calling for bold really radical change

1835
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,640
to avoid this

1836
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,920
cliff that were hopefully

1837
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,319
not going to fall over here related to

1838
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,480
climate change related to biodiversity

1839
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,440
loss

1840
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,240
and a host of other uh social and

1841
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,160
environmental problems

1842
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,559
and um you know just to just to kind of

1843
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,079
emphasize how how dangerous

1844
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,760
our situation is it is not clear if

1845
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,839
humans will go extinct with all the

1846
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,440
other extinctions that are happening

1847
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,880
and i don't mean extinct in a thousand

1848
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,520
years i mean like will there be

1849
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,039
will there at least will there be a

1850
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,280
civilization any any sensible

1851
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,559
kind of any any civilization that we're

1852
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:13,200
used to

1853
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,520
will that exist in who knows 10 years 20

1854
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
years 50 years 100 years you know like

1855
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:19,759
the

1856
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,479
our our future is highly uncertain

1857
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,799
because we have not addressed

1858
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,920
deep problems that have been with us for

1859
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,600
for many decades we've allowed them to

1860
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,719
grow worse and now we are all at risk at

1861
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,839
risk of just

1862
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,799
lower quality of life or risk of mass

1863
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,560
die off of humans and at risk

1864
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,158
ultimately of human extinction

1865
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,479
so there's lots of voices calling for

1866
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,359
bold change

1867
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,040
and that bold change can be seen in a

1868
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,799
couple of ways more

1869
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,679
the typical way to see it is reform of

1870
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,759
uh isolated societal substance

1871
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,600
systems like uh there's a lot of focus

1872
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,880
if you just read the news there's a lot

1873
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,839
of focus on

1874
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,399
green energy for example using solar

1875
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,000
powered energy and

1876
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,080
things like that uh better trans you

1877
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,920
know electric cars rather than gas

1878
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,439
gasoline engines that's all great again

1879
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,279
all of this stuff is wonderful but i

1880
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,799
would

1881
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,839
i would offer that that there's

1882
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:18,560
something

1883
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,399
really missing from this kind of

1884
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,080
assessment and that is the larger

1885
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,560
picture

1886
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,960
the the the the the meta level

1887
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,198
uh they're sometimes called in the mlp

1888
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,040
of the multi-level perspective

1889
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,359
gills it's called the the landscape

1890
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,080
level or the regime level

1891
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
and i would say that we have to address

1892
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,600
that level if we're going to really

1893
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,040
solve our problems if we're really going

1894
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,158
to develop

1895
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,000
if our systems are really going to act

1896
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,319
well as cognitive systems then we have

1897
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,158
to address

1898
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,520
the systems level the parameters

1899
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,199
and characteristics so right now the

1900
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,159
focus

1901
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,840
of all all the work that's being done in

1902
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,600
sustainability and this bold

1903
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,080
the idea of bold transformation almost

1904
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,239
all of it is focused on this kind of

1905
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,520
meso in between level uh you know

1906
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,679
the say the energy the energy

1907
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,280
infrastructure or the

1908
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,159
transportation infrastructure and this

1909
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:14,719
paper

1910
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,440
in this whole series instead is is is

1911
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,880
really focused at the

1912
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,159
at the landscape level the the large

1913
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:22,719
level

1914
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,000
the whole transformation the whole

1915
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,880
systems level okay

1916
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,840
i just wanted to make that point clear

1917
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,280
and okay so now now i

1918
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,880
you know we're we're already in part

1919
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,400
three of the series and i've

1920
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,520
i've i've listed six systems that i

1921
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,080
that are six you know meta systems or

1922
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,840
landscape level systems that i've that

1923
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,159
i'm interested in economic political

1924
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,719
legal health science and education but

1925
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:51,280
in

1926
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,320
in the first few pages of this uh paper

1927
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:54,640
i

1928
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,800
i finally say what that actually means

1929
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,719
so uh so uh the

1930
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,120
i'm basing my definition of a societal

1931
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,880
system on what's called a function

1932
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,400
system

1933
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,480
and the more there's citations there by

1934
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,159
roth and schultz and others about what a

1935
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,120
function system is

1936
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,920
comes out of social systems theory but

1937
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,120
they list uh

1938
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,719
three characteristics of a function

1939
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,960
system it has to have be observable

1940
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,960
and not a subsystem of other societal

1941
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,080
systems so the

1942
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,480
economic system is a you know entity in

1943
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,239
and of itself not a subsystem other

1944
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,679
other systems

1945
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,120
um involves a communicative system

1946
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,320
whose operations refer to a society and

1947
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,239
manifests the functional perspective at

1948
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:38,719
work

1949
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,280
at work so uh roth and schultz

1950
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,239
identified ten

1951
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,920
function systems and uh

1952
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
i would say that uh six of these i'm

1953
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,280
calling the

1954
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,880
the overarching systems the economic

1955
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,280
political legal and so on

1956
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,000
in in parentheses there i have their

1957
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,199
functions so the

1958
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,120
function the one word function of the

1959
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,199
economic system is distribution

1960
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,800
the one word function of the legal

1961
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,480
system is standardization the health

1962
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,080
system is restoration

1963
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,760
and so on the education systems

1964
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,440
formation

1965
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,719
there's a four other uh of function

1966
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,120
systems that roth and schultz identify

1967
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,000
uh art religion sport and mass media and

1968
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,320
i

1969
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
i do talk about these but i talk about

1970
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,840
them more indirectly

1971
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,480
so that's what i mean by a function

1972
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,360
system

1973
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,880
and and i also use the word

1974
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,960
or that's what i mean by a societal

1975
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,920
system and i also

1976
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,480
read the word institutions in throughout

1977
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,600
the series

1978
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,360
and it's worth spending just a little

1979
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,280
bit of spending a little time

1980
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,760
describing what i mean here um i use

1981
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,640
that in

1982
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
the term in two senses one is just

1983
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,719
concrete organizations for example a

1984
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,159
attacks or attacks uh institution

1985
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,679
inside of a governance system for

1986
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,920
example but the second meaning is is

1987
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,160
more broad it's uh

1988
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,320
[Music]

1989
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,880
more more along the lines of a social

1990
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,080
institution

1991
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,159
and this is kind of interesting because

1992
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,480
um

1993
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,040
grabner and gobarney

1994
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,040
define social institutions they give a

1995
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,320
little like a little

1996
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,719
blip there codophile systems of social

1997
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,320
structures and particular norms and

1998
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,040
rules

1999
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,640
that incline individuals to act in

2000
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,640
specific ways

2001
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,120
and uh interesting the idea this is you

2002
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,880
know they've developed these ideas apart

2003
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
from active inference but the

2004
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,600
but the language is not so dissimilar

2005
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,360
because they talk about institutions as

2006
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,440
constraining and enabling people to act

2007
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,000
and

2008
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,080
coordinate in complex and uncertain

2009
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,320
environments

2010
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,560
they stabilize the expectation of of

2011
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,000
individuals about the behavior

2012
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,280
of others and uh thus the institutions

2013
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,199
allow individuals to offload some of the

2014
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,400
cognitive burden that

2015
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,400
that they would otherwise be required to

2016
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,480
compute if if there's some kind of

2017
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,440
social norm and i expect you to behave

2018
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,199
in a certain way under a certain certain

2019
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:01,920
stance

2020
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,760
i don't have to spend a lot of thought

2021
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,440
figuring out what you're going to do

2022
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,600
next

2023
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,520
as i go about my life you know i can i

2024
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,440
can just assume that you're going to

2025
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,760
act according to the norm and then

2026
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,520
that's a whole lot of work that i don't

2027
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,080
have to do

2028
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,520
to to forecast what i think you're going

2029
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,040
to do

2030
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,840
so uh institutions allow individuals to

2031
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,840
offload some of the cognitive burden

2032
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,719
and uh and and anticipate the state of

2033
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:29,280
play

2034
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,199
and the beliefs of others so obviously

2035
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,719
that's that's related to active

2036
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:33,360
inference right

2037
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,120
active inference is uh uh at the

2038
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,800
you know when we talk about uh uh um

2039
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,000
of forming you know structuring a

2040
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,400
society or

2041
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
structuring a society to reduce

2042
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,440
uncertainty

2043
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,840
one way to do that is to develop a set

2044
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,280
of norms that this

2045
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,960
that everyone agrees to where everyone

2046
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,880
follows or mostly follows

2047
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,120
so that the uncertainty about what's

2048
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,400
going to happen next

2049
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,440
is reduced so so

2050
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,080
active infra developing institutions if

2051
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,840
they're quality institutions actually

2052
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,679
helps them to reduce free energy and

2053
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,719
expected uncertainty

2054
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,880
i i think there's a few dimensions to

2055
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,960
this and it will be fun to unpack

2056
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,120
with what does it look like to have the

2057
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,040
active inference institution

2058
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,480
what does that mean as far as the

2059
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,560
operating procedures of the

2060
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,880
internals of the business versus how the

2061
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
stakeholders interpret it how it's

2062
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,920
communicated

2063
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,840
so how it actually plays out will be

2064
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
something we're just exploring

2065
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,239
yeah yeah and when i say institutions

2066
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,480
i'm you know i'm talking uh

2067
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,840
widely so financial institutions uh

2068
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,920
you know social institutions cultural

2069
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,040
institutions

2070
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,880
and so on um and i'm i'm suggesting that

2071
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,600
they can

2072
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,520
the institutions can be viewed through

2073
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,440
the lens of active inference and may be

2074
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,080
improved

2075
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,400
by understanding you know how human

2076
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,320
cognition works and how group cognition

2077
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:58,800
works

2078
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,159
we might be able to improve our

2079
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,799
institutions

2080
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,000
um just some reminders from from our

2081
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,360
previous talks

2082
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,600
about the goals and purpose of the r d

2083
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,120
program and of

2084
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,679
and of the purpose of an organism itself

2085
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,440
and thus the purpose of a

2086
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,400
of a societal system that serve that

2087
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:18,880
serves

2088
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,719
a group of organisms the society

2089
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,320
so the the goal of transformation from

2090
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:26,960
this view

2091
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,719
is to develop and implement systems that

2092
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,440
can best facilitate societal cognition

2093
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,760
so that's the goal we have metrics to

2094
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,719
assess whether

2095
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,640
a new design is better or worse than

2096
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,159
some other design

2097
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,759
and importantly

2098
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,760
if if we weren't thinking about

2099
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,600
cognition if we were just thinking about

2100
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,719
conditions

2101
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,120
we might say the goal of transformation

2102
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,080
is to

2103
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,120
you know improve education levels or

2104
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,199
improve diets or improve

2105
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,840
quality of life in some way or improve

2106
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,440
economic security or any

2107
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,800
any number of things like that all of

2108
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,679
which are fantastic are good

2109
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,480
but once we bring once we bring this new

2110
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,040
idea

2111
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,080
of of of societal systems as cognitive

2112
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,040
architecture and

2113
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,920
into play into into play then we're

2114
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,360
talking about

2115
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,640
um the the

2116
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,800
the conditions such as clean air or

2117
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,760
clean water

2118
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,480
being the outcome of a decision-making

2119
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,440
process

2120
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,840
so the focus starts to shift to the

2121
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,440
primary

2122
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,280
uh you know the the primal goal of

2123
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,560
quality cognition versus the secondary

2124
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:40,960
goal

2125
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,679
of what quality cognition brings quality

2126
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:44,719
cognition at the

2127
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:46,880
societal level brings clean air and

2128
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,400
clean water and low

2129
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,440
uncertainty and you know higher

2130
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,840
you know good education and freedom and

2131
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,440
you know any number of other

2132
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,360
characteristics conditions you might

2133
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,800
want to list

2134
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,520
so it is important that you know this is

2135
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:01,920
this

2136
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,440
the by looking at uh societal

2137
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,080
uh systems as a cognitive architecture

2138
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,199
suddenly we have a much

2139
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,880
richer understanding of of not only how

2140
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,600
a society works and how decision making

2141
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,679
in a society works but also

2142
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,400
we have new metrics by which we can

2143
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,640
measure the success of a societal system

2144
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,040
right

2145
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,199
and so this would include cogniti

2146
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,159
cognitive

2147
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:30,400
metrics data metrics information metrics

2148
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,159
processing metrics you know all kinds of

2149
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,559
metrics

2150
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,400
so that's a little bit on on the goals

2151
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,760
of transformation and the goals of the

2152
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,719
program

2153
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,040
and a little bit on the purpose uh the

2154
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,560
purpose of the program and the purpose

2155
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,360
of a

2156
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,239
of a new design right i just want to say

2157
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:50,880
that

2158
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,280
the purpose of a design is both

2159
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,560
aspirational and functional

2160
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,440
we've already talked about design as the

2161
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,159
last step

2162
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,239
in the process of world view leads to

2163
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,080
purpose leads to fitness

2164
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,000
fitness metrics and then finally to some

2165
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,400
kind of system design

2166
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,520
so in that process in that process

2167
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,960
obviously uh purpose is uh

2168
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,280
is functional like you know everything

2169
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,040
else practically everything else depends

2170
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,600
on purpose

2171
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,040
you know or many things depend on

2172
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,280
purpose but beyond that

2173
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,920
having an explicit purpose for a club

2174
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,600
say it you know like for a particular

2175
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,040
community

2176
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,400
a clear statement of useful purpose

2177
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,440
can actually help in and of itself to a

2178
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,040
shared purpose can help to unite

2179
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,640
individuals and focus attention

2180
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,320
and uncommon causes and encourage

2181
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,320
cooperation if we all know

2182
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,239
why we're doing this together if we all

2183
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,080
know why what we're doing and why we're

2184
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,800
doing it

2185
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,520
and that and the and that purpose is to

2186
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,080
improve

2187
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,920
our collective quality of life and

2188
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,120
improve the environment

2189
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,719
well then it's going to be a lot easier

2190
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,320
to get people to

2191
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,360
come together and talk and and get

2192
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,199
and you know unite behind a shared

2193
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,120
purpose

2194
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,440
uh so in this sense a purpose itself

2195
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,520
could aid societal cognition right

2196
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,040
societal cognition depends on

2197
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,960
cooperation depends on trust

2198
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,840
so just having a just having a purpose

2199
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,159
can aid in societal cognition

2200
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,239
and and you know like as a as a

2201
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,840
counterpoint to that

2202
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,360
what is that what is the purpose of our

2203
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,800
current society you know we have these

2204
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,120
native systems of governance and

2205
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,600
economic systems you know so what is the

2206
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,239
purpose

2207
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,800
what is their purpose right what is the

2208
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,440
purpose of an economic system

2209
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,159
you know i mean we could we could debate

2210
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:36,960
that right but

2211
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,600
but there it's i would say that it's uh

2212
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,280
that if you just take things at face

2213
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,239
value

2214
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:45,520
one purpose would seem to be to promote

2215
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,639
revenue and sales and consumerism and if

2216
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,159
that's the purpose

2217
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,600
if that's part of the purpose of an

2218
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,239
economic system then why would

2219
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,400
you know it's hard to get behind that

2220
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
you know it's hard for a

2221
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,800
uh for for a whole society to say oh

2222
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,159
that's a that's wonderful let's get

2223
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,840
behind consumerism

2224
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,040
because it's so destructive

2225
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,400
okay um so a little bit on goals and

2226
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,480
purpose and on to the next slide

2227
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
uh this is just a quick review of active

2228
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,639
interest maybe i don't even need to say

2229
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,159
this because we've gone over it a few

2230
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,040
times but

2231
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,639
essentially uh you know the short view

2232
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,440
is that we can

2233
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,480
we can view action action cognition

2234
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,840
as an uncertainty reducing process

2235
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,920
so that's that's what what this is all

2236
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,679
about in a nutshell

2237
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,719
and uh the the uh through

2238
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,360
via via the active inference mechanism

2239
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,080
we

2240
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,239
take in observations we update our

2241
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,520
models we learn

2242
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,760
we take actions that can reduce our

2243
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,440
uncertainty either

2244
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,320
either either explorative actions that

2245
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,560
bring in new information epistemic

2246
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,880
epistemic actions or goal-directed

2247
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,159
actions that actually

2248
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,800
immediately or in the short term or act

2249
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,159
to improve our situation

2250
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,320
so it's all about reducing uncertainty

2251
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,360
and especially

2252
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,239
it's about reducing the uncertainty of

2253
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:08,960
of

2254
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,960
essential variables and this is of

2255
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,880
course uh you know this is a rich topic

2256
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,400
in and of itself what are the essential

2257
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,239
variables of a society

2258
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,000
i mean they you would imagine that in

2259
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,920
some way they would include clean water

2260
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,880
and food and you know sufficient food

2261
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,360
and

2262
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,920
clean air and shelter and all those

2263
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,600
kinds of things but as we talked about

2264
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,320
earlier

2265
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,120
in the last discussion there's we talked

2266
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:31,840
about

2267
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,320
maybe eight or so core human needs that

2268
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,600
include affection

2269
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,920
and freedom and a bunch of other core

2270
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:38,960
human needs

2271
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,120
so we're complex organisms and we have

2272
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,199
complex needs and these

2273
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,120
these essential variables the variables

2274
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
that really matter are themselves

2275
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,639
a complex set of variables and if we

2276
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,080
and if we focus our attention on

2277
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,800
on addressing this question of

2278
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,719
uncertainty about essential variables

2279
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,040
that almost means by definition

2280
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,440
we're doing what i what i like to call

2281
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,199
solving problems that matter

2282
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:06,960
problems that matter are the problems

2283
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,639
that really relate to the essential

2284
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:09,840
variables about how

2285
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
are we really doing how are we going to

2286
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,159
do tomorrow how will we do in 10 years

2287
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,639
yeah so so

2288
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,520
i just we'll just read the last the last

2289
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,719
sentence of the last

2290
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,120
block of text i have there this is by

2291
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,480
bad

2292
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,400
and they just they phrase they're

2293
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,159
speaking about active inference

2294
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,800
and uh the act of influence as it plays

2295
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,600
out at the

2296
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,840
social institution level and they say

2297
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,600
that the elegant idea that we can

2298
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,600
operate together to minimize collective

2299
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,560
uncertainty

2300
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,960
stands to cast a new light on classical

2301
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,199
social phenomena and that's about it

2302
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,840
in a nutshell that's it and to draw one

2303
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,480
point on that

2304
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,000
in contrast to for example reinforcement

2305
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,560
learning based approaches or reward

2306
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,639
maximization based approaches

2307
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,719
it's almost like you have the gaussian

2308
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,480
distribution it has a mean and a

2309
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,280
variance

2310
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,600
and the reward learning is like let's

2311
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,480
shift the mean

2312
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,480
up as much as possible i mean isn't the

2313
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,520
average income

2314
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,800
right now in us dollars higher than ever

2315
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,719
well maybe but then if you think about

2316
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,480
what the dollar means and how the dollar

2317
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,520
is distributed

2318
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,199
then the average doesn't really tell you

2319
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,880
too much about the distribution

2320
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,719
so active inference is about reducing

2321
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,159
your uncertainty

2322
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,639
on a specified generative model so

2323
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:27,840
somebody might think i think the

2324
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,040
distribution

2325
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,239
we might want to see this type of

2326
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,560
distribution this shape or this kind and

2327
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,080
that's a discussion to have

2328
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,000
and then we can reduce the variance

2329
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,199
around that

2330
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,520
and let the mean fall where it may so

2331
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,840
it's very different to have a reward

2332
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,080
highest as possible because having high

2333
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,199
expectations

2334
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,080
but in unstated and often unformalized

2335
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,840
variants can lead to some ridiculous

2336
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,480
outcomes

2337
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,639
like the saint petersburg paradox and

2338
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,159
other uh

2339
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,719
investing fallacies let's say yeah good

2340
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:57,360
point

2341
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,560
um uh so so your point was that uh

2342
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,600
uh reinforcement learning is aimed at

2343
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:03,920
not

2344
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,920
it's not really a necessarily a

2345
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,840
probabilistic uh

2346
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,800
approach and and if you and you will

2347
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,440
have to

2348
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,480
really ought to include the distribution

2349
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,280
of whatever

2350
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,880
targets you're looking at in order to

2351
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,040
get a better idea of you know

2352
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,120
of what's a good decision and what's not

2353
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,080
a good decision

2354
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,239
absolutely another another difference

2355
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,360
between

2356
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,719
rl and active inference is that the

2357
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,199
programmer that whoever is designing the

2358
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,360
experiment or the whoever is coding the

2359
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,880
robot or whatever

2360
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,000
has to decide in advance what the what

2361
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,400
the

2362
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,400
what the rewards are for certain actions

2363
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:42,719
so

2364
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,239
you know you fall through trapdoor

2365
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,080
negative 10 points you you

2366
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,480
you you get the you win the chess game

2367
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,159
you know positive 10 points or whatever

2368
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,679
the game is

2369
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,679
and uh active inference allows the

2370
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,480
the agent to learn goals as it goes

2371
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,639
uh learn the world as it goes and make

2372
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,320
to change its

2373
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,040
change its priorities as it goes which

2374
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:07,360
is

2375
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,040
which is exactly what humans have to do

2376
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,480
we have to be learning

2377
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,320
as we go and changing our perspective

2378
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,400
and changing our what our goals are

2379
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,159
and how what we're valuing we have to

2380
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,679
change that on the fly

2381
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,199
in order to maneuver in a highly

2382
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,679
uncertain world if i could add one more

2383
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,000
point on that it and this was expanded

2384
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,800
upon by

2385
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,440
uh noor sajid and philip ball in our one

2386
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,120
of our previous discussions

2387
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,040
that relationship and the learning of

2388
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,360
the cues in the world can be basically

2389
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,480
semantic

2390
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,600
and arbitrary so sugar isn't just always

2391
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,080
simply a reward for the human in the

2392
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,800
environment

2393
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,239
like right now i don't feel like having

2394
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,920
sugar so it's not part of my preference

2395
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,560
vector

2396
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,719
so with active inference type models we

2397
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,159
can separate out okay

2398
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,159
what's on the table in terms of our

2399
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,440
current affordances

2400
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,360
how about future affordances what are

2401
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,360
our current preferences and how sure are

2402
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,480
we about them

2403
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,880
and all these parts of the actual action

2404
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,600
plan

2405
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,920
that will help us align on shared action

2406
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,440
rather than thinking that if we simply

2407
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,000
line on

2408
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,679
shared thought then all of a sudden

2409
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:06,960
we'll know what to do because that's not

2410
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,840
even true

2411
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,840
right right good good

2412
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,638
okay so um so

2413
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,000
um we're we've been talking about

2414
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,679
societal systems as a cognitive

2415
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,639
architecture all through this

2416
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,199
but what is maybe it's time we actually

2417
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,280
gave a little thought to what cognition

2418
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,400
actually is right um

2419
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,239
so uh lyon lists 13 cognitive tasks that

2420
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:36,560
he

2421
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,199
that that he says qualifies qualifies as

2422
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,560
universal tasks or

2423
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,920
capacities and uh it is ra you know it

2424
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,320
is

2425
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,000
this is this is part of the world view

2426
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,400
that we we talked about in the first uh

2427
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,679
in the first discussion in that the

2428
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,840
all of life is intelligent all of life

2429
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,679
is engaged in cognition

2430
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,199
all living things are engaged in

2431
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:00,239
cognition and these are some of the

2432
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,520
you know some of the tasks and

2433
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,560
capacities that what we mean by that

2434
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,679
so this these hold true for a human

2435
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:08,480
certainly

2436
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,679
but they also hold true for bacteria or

2437
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,719
slime mold or plant or any

2438
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,560
any other living organism

2439
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,159
i i don't know if i need to go through

2440
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,400
all 13

2441
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,080
one by one but i'll just kind of jump

2442
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,400
around a little bit so

2443
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,920
just number one there has to be some

2444
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,000
sort of repulsion or neutrality or some

2445
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,280
kind of judgment of what's good and

2446
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,719
what's bad what's useful and what's not

2447
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:33,679
useful

2448
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,760
certainly to cognate you have to sense

2449
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,600
you have to bring in information

2450
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,040
there has to be some kind of memory

2451
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,520
storage or some kind of recall

2452
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,120
there has to be some kind of learning

2453
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,080
some kind of problem-solving behavior

2454
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,840
there has to be communication with other

2455
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,520
agents of the same kind or different

2456
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,960
kinds

2457
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,880
there has to be anticipation certainly

2458
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,400
we if we're going to

2459
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,239
make a decision about our future we have

2460
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,719
to anticipate what our future might be

2461
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,000
if we do or don't do some kind of act um

2462
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,480
there's attention there's a million

2463
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,080
things to spend our attention on as a

2464
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:06,960
human

2465
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,920
and what we spend our attention on will

2466
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,480
govern

2467
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,000
in large part the quality of the

2468
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,840
decisions that we make

2469
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,320
and the last one i'll talk about is

2470
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,600
self-identity

2471
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,040
so you know if i say i'm going to the

2472
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:21,760
store

2473
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,320
in that sentence i'm talking about this

2474
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,719
particular body right

2475
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,880
and my self-identity is focused on this

2476
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,159
particular body

2477
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,159
but i can also talk about myself as a

2478
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,480
citizen of a community as a citizen of a

2479
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,040
nation

2480
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,560
of a of a as a part of an ecosystem

2481
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,840
as a part of the biosphere so we have

2482
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,000
the capacity to self-identify

2483
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,440
at numerous levels i call that extended

2484
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,000
extended self-identity you know not just

2485
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
ourselves maybe our family maybe our

2486
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,600
community maybe our environment maybe

2487
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,280
our local environment maybe our global

2488
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,080
environment

2489
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,880
and maybe of human civilization we're a

2490
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,400
part of human civilization

2491
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,800
and as we'll see shortly how we

2492
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,239
self-identity

2493
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:06,560
how we self-identify governs to some

2494
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,440
degree

2495
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,360
the kinds of decisions and the kind of

2496
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,719
kinds of behaviors that we display

2497
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,600
so uh so these are these are we can

2498
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,880
think of these as the

2499
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,159
you know occurring in every organism and

2500
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,719
the next slide brings the two ideas

2501
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,280
together the idea of function systems

2502
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,280
and the idea of these universal

2503
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,199
cognitive tasks how do they relate to

2504
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:31,599
each other

2505
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,719
and i'm offering that that in a sense

2506
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,120
these 13 cognitive tasks are really you

2507
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,360
could think of them as building blocks

2508
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,000
for the higher level functions so for

2509
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,880
example

2510
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,920
uh an economic system say in the

2511
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,600
in the function view an economic system

2512
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,639
might involve

2513
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,520
all 13 tasks in one capacitor or another

2514
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,880
a education system might involve all 13

2515
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,800
tasks but might particularly involve the

2516
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,400
tasks about

2517
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,400
learning for example so

2518
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,638
so

2519
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,960
we can think of a lines list as

2520
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,880
containing low level cognitive building

2521
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,760
blocks

2522
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,159
and function system as being the higher

2523
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,159
level functions built on top of these or

2524
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:20,960
from these

2525
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,400
and then we can think of active

2526
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,320
inference as the multi-scale process

2527
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,280
that connects the two

2528
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,600
and these function systems then provide

2529
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,880
a cognitive architect

2530
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,960
architecture that provides a society

2531
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,120
with a with a cognitive flexibility

2532
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,600
that is a society needs to make

2533
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,400
decisions

2534
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,360
it has these uh you know six or ten

2535
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,560
different systems

2536
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,120
different uh function systems that it

2537
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,639
can make decisions through that it can

2538
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:47,760
learn through

2539
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,840
and there would be certain kinds of

2540
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,880
problems that are maybe

2541
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,440
better suited for say an economic system

2542
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,360
or a governance system or something

2543
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,880
and other kinds of problems that might

2544
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,560
be better suited for

2545
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,600
a legal system or education system but

2546
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,960
maybe some problems

2547
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,600
really have to engage multiple function

2548
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,480
systems

2549
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,320
so the fact that a society has these

2550
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,440
various uh systems of cognition

2551
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,960
it gives it a certain cognitive

2552
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,960
flexibility flexibility

2553
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,159
and provides a certain kind of

2554
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,120
redundancy and

2555
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,679
and then obviously raises the question

2556
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,840
of what kind of balance are these you

2557
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,840
know eight or ten function systems

2558
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,360
you know how does the dynamics of that

2559
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,239
balance play out

2560
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,960
uh next slide okay in this slide i'm

2561
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:37,679
just listing

2562
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,199
the next four things we're going to talk

2563
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,679
about and that'll be the if we get to it

2564
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,600
that will be the end of this

2565
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,440
our discussions today um those are

2566
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,520
those are neuronal versus human

2567
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,440
societies what are the similarities

2568
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,960
what can we learn from neuronal

2569
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,120
societies that might help us when we're

2570
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,320
thinking about design

2571
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320
all of these all of these four points

2572
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,400
are related in some way to the design of

2573
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,400
new societal systems

2574
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,560
influence how do we influence each other

2575
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,440
and particularly

2576
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,120
what is the role of coercion and

2577
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,480
influence

2578
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,440
self-identity and selfishness we we just

2579
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,719
were talking about that when i was

2580
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,560
talking about expanded self-identity

2581
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,120
and we'll pick up that theme when in a

2582
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,639
short discussion about

2583
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,920
cancer what is cancer and then lastly is

2584
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,840
power distributions we have

2585
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,159
we have eight or ten or six or ten

2586
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,600
functional systems

2587
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,800
uh if one is you know if one of those

2588
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,840
is unbalanced with the other two has too

2589
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,920
much emphasis in the society than others

2590
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,679
how does that affect a society

2591
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,840
and then also within a system if for

2592
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,679
example in an economic system if

2593
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,719
uh financial power is is

2594
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,360
uh you know concentrated how does that

2595
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,400
affect a society

2596
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,800
so we'll talk about that all that and

2597
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,880
and then with the idea that all of these

2598
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,120
pertain to the design of new systems in

2599
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,880
some way

2600
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,960
we can learn something from these topics

2601
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,639
about how we might want to design new

2602
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,159
systems

2603
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:05,199
so slide 16 um so it's kind of

2604
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,839
interesting you know

2605
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,679
our what the associations and community

2606
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,760
that happens inside of our brain to

2607
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,800
for human to solve problems is not so

2608
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,080
different in some ways about how we

2609
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,159
engage with each other in in potentially

2610
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,679
solving problems

2611
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,719
as a society so uh

2612
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,639
i'll just kind of read a little bit from

2613
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:29,920
that first paragraph but

2614
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,400
similar to neurons individuals connect

2615
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,400
with each other in complex ways just as

2616
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,440
neurons do

2617
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,600
we exchange a variety of signals over a

2618
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,760
variety of distances just like

2619
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,239
neurons do at a variety of strengths

2620
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,360
both neurons and

2621
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,199
persons can potentially connect to a

2622
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,159
very large number of others

2623
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:49,840
each can share each individual each

2624
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,600
neuron each person can share multiple

2625
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,119
connections with others

2626
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,239
and these connections can form metal

2627
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:57,679
level structures like

2628
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,840
institutions or tissues or whatever the

2629
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,400
case may be

2630
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,360
neurons and persons self-organize into

2631
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,080
modules

2632
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,000
of tissues families clubs businesses etc

2633
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,800
and neuron neuron and person-person

2634
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,080
connections are dynamic

2635
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,719
and context and need dependent the the

2636
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:17,360
the

2637
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,159
the neuronal architecture is quite

2638
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,760
flexible

2639
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,760
just as the human human social

2640
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,199
interactions are flexible

2641
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,679
associations come and go even if there

2642
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,920
remains some kind of large scale

2643
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,199
you know consistent structure and and

2644
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,840
each individual is cognitive just as

2645
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,679
each neuron is cognitive that's actually

2646
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,639
kind of a new

2647
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,520
new new result in the science literature

2648
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,760
the capacity of a neuron to process

2649
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,400
information

2650
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,679
in and of itself so uh

2651
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,119
you know obviously we want our neurons

2652
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,560
to work together we want them to

2653
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,400
associate with each other in a way that

2654
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,760
helps us to solve you know our

2655
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,119
particular problems

2656
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:59,920
we want their signals to be strong and

2657
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,719
good

2658
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,360
so that information is moves throughout

2659
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,400
the you know the

2660
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,520
neuronal process as it should

2661
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,400
uh we want to do we want our neural

2662
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,830
neural architecture to

2663
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:13,159
[Music]

2664
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:16,480
re-reorganize itself as we need to as we

2665
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,719
need to learn new tasks for example or

2666
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:19,920
new topics

2667
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,560
and all of these are this is also what

2668
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,400
we want for societies we

2669
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,480
if we're going to be part of this

2670
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,400
cognitive architecture if we're

2671
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,520
if we're engaged in societal cognition

2672
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,840
we need to associate freely with each

2673
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,119
other uh

2674
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:37,920
join join the collaborations and groups

2675
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,199
as we see fit

2676
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,239
that's part of societal cognition um

2677
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:45,040
our you know societal cognition in

2678
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,320
particular the designs

2679
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,040
of societal systems might impact any in

2680
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,040
this bulleted list that i have but

2681
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,880
one the first is the strength and the

2682
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,040
quality of associations between

2683
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,159
individuals

2684
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,600
the richness and the extent of our

2685
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,560
communication uh for example a

2686
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,520
a design a societal system design might

2687
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:03,840
have

2688
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,320
as part of it a means of communication

2689
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,280
so that

2690
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,199
say a large group of people can get

2691
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,520
together and collaborate and coming up

2692
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,280
with a decision on some topic right so

2693
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,080
the the societal system itself could

2694
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,280
have

2695
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,440
communication and coordination aspects

2696
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,280
to it

2697
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,960
temporal and spatial locations and

2698
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,960
movements of individuals affect our

2699
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,159
societal cognition

2700
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:31,280
and and designs can affect that uh

2701
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,639
quality of information

2702
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,440
that is gathered uh and in particular

2703
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,400
i'd like to point out

2704
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,239
the motivation to engage in say economic

2705
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,920
behavior

2706
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,920
hopefully will be different than it is

2707
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,520
in native systems where the

2708
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,719
motivation is largely to you know

2709
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:49,440
increase

2710
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:53,199
personal uh income and wealth

2711
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:56,560
um uh we would want

2712
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,760
go ahead oh just one one uh i

2713
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,360
was gonna ask what the differences were

2714
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,639
in contrast but finish whatever you're

2715
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,199
going to

2716
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,920
go ahead and say oh well just just on

2717
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,800
that topic

2718
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,760
you know a new design would want to

2719
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,560
employ

2720
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,000
a set of motivations that is you know

2721
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,560
very useful for societal cognition and

2722
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,920
societal health

2723
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,119
and certainly encouraging people to act

2724
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,400
in a kind of a selfish

2725
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,920
self-centered strict strict selfish way

2726
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,560
for their own gain would make little

2727
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,119
sense

2728
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:32,159
you know that's that's like a design

2729
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,639
flaw in our current system you know that

2730
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,159
we're not encouraged to

2731
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,719
cooperate and encourage to solve common

2732
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,280
problems together

2733
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,560
and the design of a system can deeply

2734
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,119
affect what our motivations for actions

2735
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:47,679
are

2736
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,760
as a matter of fact a design ought to

2737
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,280
make cooperation

2738
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,400
so easy that it becomes the de facto

2739
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,080
default behavior

2740
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,560
it should that should be the kind of you

2741
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,560
would think that would be the

2742
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,719
how it how a good design would work is

2743
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,560
it would just reduce the barriers to

2744
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,239
cooperation and communication and

2745
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,760
coordination because

2746
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,040
th those are all key to um

2747
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,960
societal decision making and learning

2748
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,400
yeah uh other just a few others here

2749
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,920
uh the design might affect uh

2750
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,119
for example how well as a society's

2751
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,440
beliefs aligns with its reality you know

2752
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,400
for example

2753
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,760
if if in a new design

2754
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,000
there's a strong role for science and

2755
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:34,960
there's funding

2756
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,600
in you know funding in clubs for

2757
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,280
scientific exploration

2758
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,520
well then maybe it's more likely that

2759
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,920
that new systems will be more aligned

2760
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,719
with

2761
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,320
the beliefs of people working in new

2762
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,560
systems or engaging in new systems might

2763
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,119
be more aligned with realities because

2764
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,719
you know the best science has it best

2765
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,719
as at its best is aiming towards a

2766
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,159
better understanding

2767
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:02,480
of of of of our world

2768
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,880
um design might affect how independent

2769
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,199
and

2770
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:09,520
co-op cooperative individuals are as i

2771
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,040
mentioned a minute ago

2772
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,800
um also might affect how uh well

2773
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,159
how deeply the level of critical

2774
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,320
critical thinking is right how how well

2775
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,840
does a society does a community

2776
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
encourage critical thinking through

2777
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,280
education and through

2778
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,679
norms and through other processes but

2779
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,760
obviously critical thinking is important

2780
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,199
in problem solving you

2781
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:34,960
can't solve problems if you're not doing

2782
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,159
critical thinking you can't solve

2783
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,440
problems well

2784
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,520
and and also the capacity to plan the

2785
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,960
extensive and the extent of the

2786
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,320
anticipatory horizon

2787
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:46,560
you know what a design might affect uh

2788
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,600
how how much attention is paid to

2789
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,199
various predictions made by

2790
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,040
organizations and groups

2791
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,199
um maybe it would be important to pay

2792
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,719
attention to the predictions that people

2793
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,080
made so we can understand

2794
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,440
who is good at who is who has a skill uh

2795
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,159
you know who's good how can we improve

2796
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,440
our capacity

2797
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:08,159
to anticipate what's going to happen

2798
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:09,679
next

2799
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,400
so in numerous ways in the same sense

2800
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,199
that

2801
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,480
that design design of a brain system

2802
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,400
might affect

2803
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,679
cognition within the neural communities

2804
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,960
some of those same uh ideas can play out

2805
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:25,840
in the design of

2806
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,600
societal systems because you know

2807
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,239
associations and etc etc

2808
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,040
would be important at the societal level

2809
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,119
i'll just point out as an evolutionary

2810
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:39,679
biologist that selection has shaped

2811
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,639
[Music]

2812
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,719
on stumbles certainly and so several

2813
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,679
patients of today

2814
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,679
have benefited from developmental

2815
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,119
basically patterning that has been

2816
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,800
selected on for a long long time

2817
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,520
many many many generations so real

2818
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,040
evolutionary pressures

2819
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,880
the kind that create resilient neural

2820
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,040
systems at the level of societies

2821
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,480
would require essentially

2822
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,400
population-like dynamics

2823
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,800
competing and the birth and the death

2824
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,480
and the diversification of human

2825
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,440
societies

2826
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,239
so systems mapping is really helpful and

2827
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,239
the toolkit transfers there for sure

2828
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,320
but there's a key evolutionary bit that

2829
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,920
neuronal ensembles have that ant

2830
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,960
colonies have

2831
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,199
that simply saying distributed systems

2832
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:22,639
are like those two things

2833
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,159
uh is is not there but in the long range

2834
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:29,280
that's where it would be yeah yeah um i

2835
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,960
i think i've said this before but

2836
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,800
um but you know if we're talking about

2837
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,239
how can society do better at cognition

2838
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,679
be you know what kind of systems might

2839
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:41,199
facilitate cognition

2840
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,360
well then all we have to do is look at

2841
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,719
evolution we look at

2842
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,560
how the what what is the world doing

2843
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,880
around us how does a brain work

2844
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,880
these are you know the the the

2845
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,199
information and the ideas and the

2846
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,520
and the and the patterns that we see

2847
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,480
throughout nation

2848
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,480
of throughout nature can be look we can

2849
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,760
learn from them

2850
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,800
as to how good cognitive systems work

2851
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,960
because nature is built

2852
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,119
that nature is a good cognitive system

2853
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,840
right there's so much to learn from

2854
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:11,679
nature

2855
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,360
cool um all right so

2856
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,320
this is the second of the four topics uh

2857
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,119
influence

2858
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:21,040
how do we influence each other so we

2859
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,119
have a group obviously the people will

2860
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:23,600
be

2861
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,119
there's problems to solve there's

2862
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:26,719
activities to to

2863
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:30,320
undertake there's uh challenges that

2864
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,360
arise

2865
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,760
and group members would try to influence

2866
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,000
with one another in some ways

2867
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
through communication or you know some

2868
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,679
kind of communication

2869
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,239
and turner the fellow i'm focusing on

2870
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:43,119
here uh

2871
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,760
his ideas come from uh he did work he

2872
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,440
worked in uh

2873
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,440
social identity theory self-catering

2874
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,520
categorization theory and some other

2875
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,520
related fields and he uh

2876
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,719
identifies two forms of influence

2877
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,880
now this is not this this is not coming

2878
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,800
from you know the active inference world

2879
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,440
but i'm

2880
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,360
going to make the point at the end that

2881
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,800
the two are

2882
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,800
closely aligned with each other um

2883
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,840
one time type of influence is persuasion

2884
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,000
and that's where you simply argue that

2885
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,679
your you know your understanding of

2886
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,600
realities in some way better than other

2887
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,719
understandings or

2888
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,520
your your path of action is in some way

2889
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:23,840
been

2890
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
more beneficial than other paths of

2891
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,679
action but already then we're

2892
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,199
you know we're talking about aspects of

2893
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:30,960
of cognition in the human brain

2894
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,320
or active inference because we're

2895
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,000
talking about some kind of

2896
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
uh testing of a model you know of of

2897
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,040
looking at potential paths forward in

2898
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,679
action

2899
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,840
and then evaluating them as for as

2900
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,080
regards to which is the most beneficial

2901
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,520
path to take

2902
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,760
so already we're we're touching on the

2903
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,400
ground of active inference

2904
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,440
another form of influence is control and

2905
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,040
that comes in two flavors

2906
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,679
legitimate authority and coercion and

2907
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,199
legitimate authority we've already

2908
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,480
talked about this because we've talked

2909
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,719
about institutions and offloading

2910
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,040
of cognition from the individual level

2911
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,320
to the group level through

2912
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,000
social institutions of one kind or

2913
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,440
another norms or

2914
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,760
actual concrete institutions and things

2915
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:14,840
like that

2916
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:18,239
um and by and large legitimate authority

2917
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:22,400
people people are are are willing

2918
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,600
to uh prove to you know

2919
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,840
accept legitimate authority that because

2920
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,280
they understand that it's in their best

2921
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,280
interest

2922
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,760
you know one one example is we most of

2923
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,119
the work most of us

2924
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:38,239
in the world are okay if uh if a traffic

2925
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,920
cop stops someone who is

2926
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,760
uh you know speeding at a very high

2927
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,840
speed because that's dangerous to us all

2928
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,400
and we

2929
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,040
are glad the traffic cop is going to

2930
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,280
take some action and exercise authority

2931
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,199
over this fellow who's endangering the

2932
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:52,320
rest of us

2933
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:56,159
so by and large we we

2934
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,239
we are good with legitimate authority

2935
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,400
and we don't feel that it limits our

2936
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,400
our freedom um and then there's coercion

2937
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,679
which is more of a confrontational uh

2938
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,719
form of influence where you maybe

2939
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,000
force someone to to take us behave in a

2940
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,360
certain way or to

2941
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,800
um you know act in a certain way

2942
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,199
and there's various forms of coercion

2943
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,080
that can occur

2944
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,040
uh including various forms of

2945
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,960
manipulation i'll just list a few

2946
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,040
but that could be disinformation deceit

2947
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,719
emissions obstruction

2948
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,880
the exercise of false authority drowning

2949
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,000
out or silencing

2950
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,880
of competing voices or various things so

2951
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,800
you know this is rampant

2952
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,080
in our societies today these these occur

2953
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,840
you turn on the tv and you'll see

2954
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,159
evidence of all of these

2955
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:49,360
and uh turner makes the

2956
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,600
point that coercion all of these forms

2957
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,639
of coercion

2958
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,800
is easily abused and very dangerous to a

2959
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,920
society

2960
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,960
because it re that tends to reduce

2961
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,080
trust in societal institutions

2962
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,920
it tends to reduce the long-term health

2963
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,119
of the group

2964
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:09,119
can be destructive in the sense that

2965
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,239
coercion

2966
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,440
breeds resentment to you know to being

2967
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,080
forced to

2968
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,960
behave in a certain way and it can

2969
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,440
reduce

2970
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,719
trust and reduce cooperation and it

2971
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:23,040
increases an antagonistic climate

2972
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,600
and uh that remains then that the

2973
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,360
society who's during the coercion of the

2974
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,800
group that's during the coercion has to

2975
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,440
use even

2976
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,880
more energy and more resources to

2977
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,280
buckle down and make and make the

2978
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,880
question even more severe so that they

2979
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,840
can get

2980
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,800
the individuals to behave in the way

2981
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,920
they want

2982
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,080
so uh you know there's a role for

2983
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,360
coercion especially say like a you know

2984
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,679
police uh uh

2985
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,000
arresting a someone dangerous who has a

2986
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,800
gun and

2987
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,320
is about to shoot someone you would hope

2988
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,679
that they would tackle that person to

2989
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,199
the ground or whatever

2990
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,280
and prevent them from doing that from

2991
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,639
hurting others

2992
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:05,280
so there's a role for coercion but it

2993
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,360
can be easily abused as i said and must

2994
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,000
be used

2995
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,159
very transparently and judiciously or

2996
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,639
else in the long run the whole society

2997
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:13,199
is going to

2998
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:16,840
suffer and potentially go down the tubes

2999
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,159
um

3000
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,639
um so that's the way he sees it and then

3001
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:21,199
we can

3002
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,719
we can see how this plays out in the

3003
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,400
active active inference

3004
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,840
framework already we've talked about

3005
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,000
persuasion and the the similarities

3006
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,679
between persuasion and learning

3007
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:32,400
and then legitimate legitimate authority

3008
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,480
as being similar to

3009
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,520
offloading of cognition to insta social

3010
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,840
institutions

3011
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,800
and obviously when we're talking about

3012
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,040
influence we're talking about group

3013
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,320
associations

3014
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,880
and we've already now mentioned that in

3015
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,880
with respect to neuronal associations

3016
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,840
and how the

3017
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,920
how neurons and cis and people in a

3018
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,360
society have to have

3019
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,960
the freedom to associate at will to

3020
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,199
to provide flexible cognition for the

3021
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,199
society

3022
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:08,560
um right so association is a part of

3023
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,119
influence

3024
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,960
just the fact that we're associating and

3025
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,159
and and uh

3026
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,719
you know trying to influence one another

3027
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:17,520
is a part of cognition

3028
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,440
so so what are the impacts of this on

3029
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,199
design like how to how would we

3030
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:23,280
how would how might we change a design

3031
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,800
or or what kind of design

3032
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,679
elements might we incorporate into new

3033
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,080
societal systems if this was our concern

3034
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,639
if if we wanted to encourage persuasion

3035
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,199
and legitimate authority

3036
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,800
how you know what this is the question

3037
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:39,520
i'm asking

3038
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,719
you know the world in this paper is

3039
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,159
how how does how could this impact

3040
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,960
design and you can think of a few things

3041
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,520
off the top of your head

3042
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,239
for example transparency would help this

3043
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,280
process

3044
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,400
uh coercion is very difficult to

3045
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,159
achieve if there's high transparency

3046
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:03,760
if there's quality information flowing

3047
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,520
then coercion is more difficult to

3048
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,440
achieve if there's quality education

3049
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,800
happening maybe even especially

3050
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,800
uh education about what coercion is what

3051
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,880
what is manipulation what are the what

3052
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,360
are the many faces of manipulation

3053
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,040
how do different groups in society use

3054
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,920
how do they how do they uh how do they

3055
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,719
manipulate

3056
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:29,440
in order in order to you know get their

3057
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,400
will how is

3058
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,800
uh how what is the role of media in

3059
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,400
coercion you know these are all

3060
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,199
these are all good questions to ask if

3061
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:38,000
we're talking about

3062
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,639
what kinds of new designs would we want

3063
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,320
in order to avoid some of these problems

3064
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,599
nice

3065
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,280
the next of these four topics is

3066
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,719
self-identity uh

3067
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,840
and uh use the example of cancer here so

3068
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,040
uh um levin has published a couple of

3069
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,239
papers that i think are really

3070
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,159
interesting on this topic

3071
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:05,679
and uh it's it's cl it's true that as

3072
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,920
cancer as a cancer develops in a body

3073
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,719
the communication tends to up to be

3074
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:11,440
changed

3075
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,679
there there can be less quality

3076
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:14,480
communication

3077
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,320
between a cancer you know between a

3078
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,480
tumor and the surrounding tissues

3079
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,840
and at the same time there can be more

3080
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
communication between cancer cells or

3081
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,199
within a tumor so

3082
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,080
so communication kind of goes haywire in

3083
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,880
a cancer or can go haywire

3084
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,159
and uh the

3085
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,960
the idea that levin has is that what

3086
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,719
happens is

3087
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:39,280
we often we often we often portray a

3088
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,280
cancer as being a selfish

3089
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,880
you know a selfish growth that's

3090
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,400
occurring in the body

3091
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,000
and he says you know it's not really

3092
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,440
quite like that it's uh

3093
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,239
it's a little bit more like both normal

3094
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:50,960
tissue

3095
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,320
and cancer tissue is self-interested

3096
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,719
and acting in a self-preserving manner

3097
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:57,440
the difference

3098
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,599
is what the extent you know the

3099
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:01,199
functional extent of self

3100
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,760
is for the two populations so the

3101
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,679
functional extent itself for

3102
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,199
for normal tissue normal cells in a

3103
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,520
normal tissue is the whole body like the

3104
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,760
cells are connected and are

3105
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,199
communicating with

3106
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,280
other cells in the body both locally and

3107
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:16,560
distantly so the

3108
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,080
the body is a

3109
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,560
cognitive apparatus you could say an

3110
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,480
extension of an individual cell

3111
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,080
outward to a larger cognitive apparatus

3112
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,280
a larger environment a larger milieu

3113
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,760
and in a cancer cell that those

3114
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,440
communication that communication is

3115
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,560
breaking down

3116
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,960
and this the functional extent of cell

3117
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,960
for a cancer cell might be

3118
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,560
you know might grow smaller and smaller

3119
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,119
and smaller so the cancer cell

3120
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,960
just like the normal cell is acting in a

3121
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,480
self-interested and self-preserving

3122
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,199
manner

3123
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,440
only its functional extensive self is

3124
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,320
small

3125
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:55,280
so uh it's taking care of us it's

3126
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,320
including

3127
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:00,080
in its self a small group of cells

3128
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,520
small tissue as uh relative to the body

3129
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,639
so it's it it's its ability to to

3130
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:09,840
think in a sense cognate shrinks because

3131
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,520
it's no longer attached to the rest of

3132
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,440
the cognitive apparatus of the body

3133
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,320
it's has to do any cognitive processing

3134
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,360
that it can do

3135
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,639
within a much smaller set of cells so

3136
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:23,360
it's capacity to act say over multiple

3137
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,719
time scales to

3138
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,920
behave in such a way that it will exist

3139
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,760
in two years or five years is reduced

3140
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,440
because it's it's he has a nice

3141
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,239
term for it he calls it the cognitive

3142
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,080
light cone of self

3143
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,400
is reduced in the cancer and this is

3144
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,760
really interesting you know when we talk

3145
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,639
about us

3146
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,560
how this might play out it's at a

3147
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,159
societal level right

3148
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:51,040
there's uh you know there's there's

3149
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,440
maybe some injury or stress in a certain

3150
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,560
population

3151
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,560
that population is is retracting itself

3152
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,199
from maybe an from the rest of the

3153
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,880
society the rest of the environment

3154
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,639
because it's maybe feels threatened or

3155
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:05,440
it feels

3156
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,320
unheard or it feels unappreciated or if

3157
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,080
just is under stress

3158
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:14,400
and uh it's you know the the

3159
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,280
local group is forming that is more

3160
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,639
interested in the local

3161
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:23,920
cognitive uh light cone of self

3162
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,040
a smaller like cone of self uh

3163
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,040
and that can be dangerous you know if if

3164
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,800
that happens too much in a society that

3165
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,599
can be dangerous

3166
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,440
it can also be useful because people are

3167
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,280
getting together in small groups to

3168
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,639
think about how to solve a problem that

3169
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:38,400
can also be useful

3170
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,719
but but if that is if there's too much

3171
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,159
of that or if it happens under the wrong

3172
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:43,440
circumstances

3173
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,320
then you can get the situation where the

3174
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,920
society is really kind of

3175
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,320
starting to disintegrate because because

3176
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,000
there are elements in the society that

3177
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,199
are acting

3178
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:56,880
preserving the small self and acting to

3179
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,280
you know protect the small self as

3180
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,599
opposed to the whole

3181
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:03,599
and you know you can just imagine what

3182
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,119
that leads to

3183
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:08,320
and so the so the task of design

3184
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:11,599
then is to create a a cognitive

3185
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:12,560
framework

3186
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,800
that where in which communication is

3187
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,760
rich in which everyone's voice is heard

3188
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,400
in which

3189
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,199
problems are actually addressed and not

3190
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:21,520
just

3191
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,880
glossed over or ignored where where

3192
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,920
the needs of uh you know the whole are

3193
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,760
taken into account

3194
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,480
uh where everyone's story matters

3195
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,040
where everyone has an opportunity to

3196
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,159
impact the

3197
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:40,239
larger workings of the society the

3198
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,199
decisions that the

3199
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:44,239
society makes and uh you know

3200
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,400
building such a design building such a

3201
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,360
society

3202
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,520
and a cognitive system then would reduce

3203
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,400
the risk

3204
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,119
of you could say cancerous growths

3205
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,040
occurring

3206
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,760
uh right so uh you know the cancer is

3207
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:59,199
informative in this sense you know it's

3208
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:01,280
an amazing i what my background is in

3209
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,639
cancer biology

3210
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:05,280
and it's a never-ending source of

3211
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,800
information and

3212
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,599
you know to look at how complex the

3213
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:11,360
complexity of the

3214
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,480
situation surrounding cancer

3215
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,639
so that's it so you know we can design

3216
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,639
systems so that cognitive light cone

3217
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:19,199
itself

3218
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,440
is expanded rather than contracted and

3219
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,520
that's going to go a long ways towards

3220
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,920
towards you know kind of encouraging

3221
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,800
cooperation

3222
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,679
encouraging coordination encouraging

3223
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:31,920
group problem solving on group problems

3224
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,880
you know nice thank you

3225
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:41,199
the last topic is uh power distributions

3226
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,360
so we've been talking about uh

3227
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,960
functional systems each functional

3228
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,320
system has a function i've

3229
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,239
listed some of those and each functional

3230
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,239
system also operates

3231
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,639
via a particular medium so for example

3232
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:53,280
you know the

3233
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:56,880
a good example is the economic system

3234
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,880
operating under with the through the

3235
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,360
medium of money

3236
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,719
uh so some authors that i cite suggest

3237
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:05,520
that each

3238
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,520
functional system if left unchecked

3239
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,719
tends to

3240
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,880
have a growth imperative and we

3241
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,639
certainly see that in the economic

3242
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:14,400
system it's like everything is now

3243
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,440
suddenly uh my couch and my

3244
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,360
living room is now worth money because i

3245
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,440
can sell it to

3246
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,520
someone who wants to visit my hometown

3247
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,280
for a weekend right so

3248
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,760
everything is commoditized now or many

3249
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,280
many things are commoditized that used

3250
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,639
to be

3251
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:33,360
more freely shared without just in the

3252
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,880
course of life

3253
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,000
with uh with people who had needs so i

3254
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,760
sell my i sell my time i sell my

3255
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,599
resources i sell my ideas

3256
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:48,639
and uh and and and financial

3257
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,199
the financial system seems to have

3258
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:54,400
overtaken many aspects of our life

3259
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:57,760
so in that sense in our current society

3260
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,159
you might say that the the financial the

3261
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:01,360
economic system

3262
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:04,960
is over emphasized relative to the other

3263
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,760
functional system say the education

3264
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,480
system and

3265
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:12,239
other systems so uh

3266
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:13,599
obviously then when we're talking about

3267
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:15,440
design one of the goals of design

3268
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:18,880
is to balance the the

3269
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,480
the influence of each function system

3270
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,840
and that is a topic that we already

3271
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,280
mentioned very briefly about in

3272
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,119
integrating systems

3273
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:30,480
together so integrated economic system

3274
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,599
legal system

3275
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:33,440
governance system you know all serving

3276
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,880
the same purpose

3277
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,560
and all acting as a as a flexible

3278
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,400
uh cognitive architecture for the

3279
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,960
greater good of the of the whole

3280
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:45,280
if i can give a comment on that uh you

3281
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,040
mentioned checks and balances

3282
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,360
and that in the american context

3283
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,400
referred to

3284
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,920
several separations within the

3285
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,599
governance mechanisms and the

3286
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:55,119
development that happened

3287
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:57,840
subsequent here we're talking about

3288
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,440
checks and balances in a little bit more

3289
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,719
of a general

3290
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:04,159
cybernetic goal-oriented system way

3291
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:05,199
and we're talking about checks and

3292
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,119
balances between these different sectors

3293
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:08,320
it almost sounds like

3294
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,599
so it's not just that there's going to

3295
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,400
be market mechanisms with all of the

3296
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,480
manufacturers of a product competing on

3297
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,599
that one dimension

3298
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,280
and then on a separate sector there's

3299
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,280
competition of the academics on this one

3300
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,800
question in this one way

3301
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,040
how can we link those competitions in a

3302
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,239
way that actually

3303
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:26,159
is aligned with the overall goals of

3304
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,679
society right exactly

3305
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:30,400
how can we align all of the systems to

3306
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,840
the same purpose

3307
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,560
which is the the you know the the

3308
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,320
reduced uncertainty and expected

3309
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,760
uncertainty of the

3310
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,440
of the society in relation to the

3311
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,040
essential variables the things that

3312
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,320
matter

3313
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:45,199
right so that's one uh aspect of design

3314
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:45,599
on this

3315
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,400
is how can we maintain a balance among

3316
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,280
systems

3317
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,040
but another aspect is how can we

3318
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,360
maintain a balance within systems

3319
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,440
so the economic system again provides a

3320
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,880
really good example here

3321
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,040
and i i say i have a sentence there that

3322
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,719
today the wealthiest one percent of

3323
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:02,639
individuals globally own about 40

3324
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,560
percent of the world's wealth

3325
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,800
now that is like insane i mean that is

3326
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,520
crazy especially if we think of money as

3327
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,199
a voting tool

3328
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,520
i mean money is a voting tool it's it's

3329
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,400
an info it's

3330
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,040
not a recognized formal voting tool

3331
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:17,520
right

3332
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,320
but it's a undemocratic one if i have if

3333
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:20,560
i

3334
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,800
if i'm a billionaire i have lots of

3335
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,560
votes in this world i can get people to

3336
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:25,360
do

3337
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,199
any number of things that i wish them to

3338
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:28,719
do i can direct

3339
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:30,719
non-profits to focus on particular

3340
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:31,760
issues i can

3341
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,159
i can make a new company that does a

3342
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:34,960
particular

3343
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,639
you know provides a particular service

3344
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:38,320
or or

3345
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,360
you know i can i i can i have all

3346
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,199
kind i have a billion times more

3347
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:44,639
influence than

3348
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:47,920
just a normal person right so money is a

3349
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:48,800
voting tool

3350
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,800
and it's just uh it's just used as an

3351
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,159
undemocratic one

3352
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:54,320
but it could be used as a democratic

3353
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,280
voting tool it could

3354
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:58,239
the money system the economic system

3355
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:58,960
could be

3356
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,239
highly transparent it could

3357
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:05,679
it could achieve a um a

3358
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:08,000
reasonable degree or even a strong

3359
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,599
degree of income and wealth

3360
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:13,520
equality so that the money as a voting

3361
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:17,599
tool becomes a fair voting tool

3362
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:20,560
right like in a democracy we would not

3363
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,960
we would not stand for

3364
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,199
i get one vote and some and the guy down

3365
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:26,800
the street gets a billion votes i mean

3366
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,560
that would just we would recognize that

3367
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,480
as being deeply unfair

3368
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,480
but it's the same thing in an economic

3369
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,639
system if if one person has one dollar

3370
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,080
another and the next guy has a billion

3371
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:36,880
dollars

3372
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,119
that person has enormous control over

3373
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:39,920
how

3374
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:42,560
uh society makes decisions so it's not

3375
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,840
just economic power

3376
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,280
i mean i'm focusing on the economic

3377
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,639
system but there's you know there's six

3378
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:48,320
or ten systems that we could be focusing

3379
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,000
on here and each of them has some kind

3380
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,880
of medium

3381
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,880
and we could talk about the distribution

3382
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,400
of power in any of them

3383
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,159
for example we could talk about the

3384
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,599
distribution of power in a

3385
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:00,639
in a governance system currently in the

3386
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:01,679
u.s

3387
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:03,679
there are what 400 i don't know how many

3388
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,360
how many legislators and senators do we

3389
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,719
have in total i don't know what that

3390
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:08,480
amounts to but

3391
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,560
compared to the population this is a

3392
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,880
time we have a we have empowered

3393
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,520
we have put enormous power in the hands

3394
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,280
of a tiny sliver of

3395
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:20,239
people and you know does is that a good

3396
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,199
idea

3397
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:23,599
in today's world could we do better i

3398
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:24,880
imagine

3399
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,040
that a different kind of governance

3400
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,119
system would destroy would do a far

3401
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:31,360
better job of distributing power

3402
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,599
so that everyone can have feel like

3403
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:35,040
their voice is heard and that they can

3404
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:38,320
be part of the decision-making process

3405
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,679
you know as it stands right like right

3406
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:42,080
now in america i get i get to vote every

3407
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,040
two years

3408
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,840
uh about like a yes i get like a thumbs

3409
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:46,880
up or a thumbs down

3410
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,840
on certain candidates and that's that's

3411
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,679
kind of it formally that's it i mean i

3412
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:53,679
can do some informal things i can

3413
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,599
write to my congressman or i can you

3414
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:57,119
know i can

3415
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:59,040
complain in the newspaper or write a

3416
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,800
letter to the editor or something but as

3417
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,920
far as formal

3418
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,719
things that i can do to have my very

3419
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:05,520
nuanced

3420
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:08,639
understanding of the world heard all i

3421
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,040
all i really get is a is like a yes or

3422
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,040
no every few years you know and then

3423
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,599
a group of candidates and that's hardly

3424
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:17,920
that's hardly taken advantage of my

3425
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,520
understanding of the world right i i

3426
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:20,800
have much more

3427
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,000
uh insight to offer than just a simple

3428
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,560
yes or no every few years

3429
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,960
so i think it would be possible then to

3430
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,599
uh

3431
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:32,800
to to design systems that balance

3432
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,000
this medium of communication

3433
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,040
in each of the function systems achieve

3434
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,360
some much greater degree of incoming

3435
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,480
wealth equality

3436
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:45,199
achieves a much greater degree of power

3437
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:47,840
distribution within governance systems

3438
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,239
uh power distribution within legal

3439
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:51,360
systems

3440
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:55,119
uh you know there's a great room for

3441
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:56,159
improvement

3442
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:59,040
on all of these

3443
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:02,239
uh yeah so i think is there one more oh

3444
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:04,239
there's one more slide

3445
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,960
yep and uh that is really focused on

3446
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,679
economic

3447
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,360
power so the first one i already talked

3448
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,960
about using money as a

3449
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,079
voting tool we already do that and we

3450
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:16,239
would be better if we just

3451
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:18,639
did that above board and in a democratic

3452
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,400
and transparent fashion

3453
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,320
and new systems could do that and when i

3454
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,239
say economic systems again i am

3455
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:26,000
including in that monetary systems

3456
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,599
financial systems and the bigger picture

3457
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,280
um a large set of studies have shown

3458
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,360
that incoming wealth inequality is bad

3459
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,480
for society

3460
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,199
it affects uh health cooperation trust

3461
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:40,880
anxiety happiness

3462
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,920
social cohesion and then mortality and

3463
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,239
uh social stability in a number and

3464
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:47,679
numerous other factors so

3465
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,440
it's quite clear that high amounts of uh

3466
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,000
any income and wealth inequality are

3467
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,520
detrimental to society

3468
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:59,760
and and again today we are extremely

3469
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,400
uh unequal extremely unequal

3470
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,800
and then uh the last just to end this

3471
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,760
whole uh

3472
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:10,400
talk today i would like to point out

3473
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,880
that income equality

3474
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:16,320
is really not a there's a it's kind of

3475
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,920
it's not unpopular the concept is not

3476
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:18,719
unpopular

3477
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:20,320
there was a large study done a few years

3478
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,840
ago where they

3479
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,159
showed they didn't they didn't they

3480
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,040
showed

3481
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:28,639
participants uh graphs of the division

3482
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:30,159
of economic power

3483
02:05:30,159 --> 02:05:32,560
income and things like that uh two you

3484
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:35,199
know they had three different choices

3485
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:37,920
an image that was really uh very equal

3486
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,320
like

3487
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:42,400
50 50 equal one that was uh fairly equal

3488
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,560
but not quite you know not quite

3489
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,760
perfectly equal

3490
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,119
and then a really extreme one well it

3491
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:49,920
turned out that

3492
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,520
people didn't you know they asked you

3493
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,800
ask people like which of these do you

3494
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,679
prefer

3495
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:56,159
and it turned out that they didn't like

3496
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:57,920
the extreme one at all

3497
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,440
and that happened to be the one that was

3498
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,440
the picture of the u.s

3499
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:04,560
inequality in the u.s and uh and the one

3500
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,079
that was more mild i think was the

3501
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:07,199
inequality maybe in

3502
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:10,400
in sweden or something like that so they

3503
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,840
they preferred the the distributions of

3504
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,679
economic power that were less

3505
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:18,960
less extreme and when asked

3506
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,960
which of these do you think is the most

3507
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,119
fair for the society

3508
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:26,800
the the the uh more than half of those

3509
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,400
quarried and this was many thousands of

3510
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:29,840
people who were queried

3511
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,400
chose actual income equality like you

3512
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:32,960
know like

3513
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,440
completely in equal incomes as the most

3514
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,800
fair way

3515
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,360
to run a society and i don't i don't

3516
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,719
suppose that they

3517
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:42,079
that people really thought that was

3518
02:06:42,079 --> 02:06:44,239
possible like you know that's i know

3519
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:45,920
it's not possible but that would be the

3520
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,599
more fair way that's what i imagine

3521
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,119
people were thinking

3522
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:52,159
and uh when we next come back to talk

3523
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:53,599
we'll talk about the leader framework

3524
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:54,400
and some

3525
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,840
potential designs that actually would

3526
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,639
achieve

3527
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:01,040
income equality income and wealth

3528
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:02,800
equality over time

3529
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,840
so that's that's yet to come

3530
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,040
wow awesome that really flew by that i

3531
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:14,000
uh after some little tech bumps

3532
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,480
it was awesome and that is a little bit

3533
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,079
like an analogy for maybe

3534
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:20,800
this program there's some technical

3535
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,840
details up front

3536
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,920
few live streams to start a few few

3537
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,119
teams few memes

3538
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:28,719
but um maybe once there's momentum

3539
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:31,040
and once there's proof in the world and

3540
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:31,920
a little bit more of

3541
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:34,000
a contact between the theory and the

3542
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,440
practice we would see

3543
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,079
some new kinds of momentum so maybe give

3544
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:39,040
a last

3545
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:40,719
comment what is going to happen in the

3546
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:42,560
fourth session and then our two

3547
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,520
group discussions and um yeah yeah we're

3548
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,040
gonna work we have one more uh

3549
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,199
i'm glad you said that because i did

3550
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:50,480
want to say to folks that we have one

3551
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:51,599
more discussion

3552
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,840
in this series coming up next week and

3553
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,599
in that discussion we'll talk about the

3554
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:57,440
leader framework as a prototype and some

3555
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,800
of the things it might achieve how it

3556
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,960
might work

3557
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,239
and that

3558
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:06,400
is a big part of our discussion next

3559
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,679
time

3560
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:11,119
and then there's two regularly scheduled

3561
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:13,520
regular scheduled discussions on part

3562
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,040
three of the paper that will

3563
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:18,239
happen in may

3564
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:20,320
i think the first one is in two weeks

3565
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,440
it's the first two

3566
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:24,800
tuesdays of may at 7 00 a.m pacific

3567
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,040
and that will be like the group active

3568
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,480
inference live stream so we'll have a

3569
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,440
bunch of other

3570
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,280
colleagues and that will be more of a

3571
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,440
group discussion but the fourth

3572
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,280
conversation between just us will be

3573
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:36,800
april 27th

3574
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,520
at 3 30 pm pacific so i'm really looking

3575
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:40,320
forward to that

3576
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:43,679
and thanks for um for coming on for so

3577
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,360
many times and giving us so many

3578
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,079
good insights and we appreciate your

3579
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:49,679
time and all the participants who stuck

3580
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:51,599
with us also for the tech

3581
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:54,719
thanks thanks for having me after
