00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,400
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
welcome thanks for joining actin flab

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,759
this

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,560
is live stream number 21.2

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,920
i think and this is our sixth discussion

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
with john the first four were background

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,840
discussions where

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
john and i worked through these jam

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,960
boards

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,679
and through the three-part series that

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,800
john had written

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
science-driven societal transformation

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,239
and

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
now here we are today on may 11th

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,800
2021 in our second participatory group

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,640
discussion so this is going to be

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,680
an unpacking and an extension and an

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,960
opportunity to

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,120
share perspectives and ask john

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,000
questions

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
so thanks to all who have joined live

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
and who will be joining live

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
and also if you're watching on youtube

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
feel free to leave a question in the

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,840
chat and we will

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,319
relay that to you so we're just going to

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,040
go around

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
with a quick round of introductions

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
maybe each of us could just say hello

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,680
and something that they're thinking of

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
or something that they're excited to

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,680
talk about

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
today and then we will pass back to

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,119
john and just start off on this road

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,320
together so

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
i'm daniel and i'm in california i will

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:23,920
pass

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
to lee

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
hi uh i'm lee i'm in i'm in london at

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,159
the minute

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
um although i'm a phd researcher at the

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,520
university of york

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,400
uh john i'm today i'm interested to talk

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,880
about

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
um maybe a minimum viable prototype for

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
one of the clubs um and also uh

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
a little bit around the the metaphor of

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
the super organism a bit as well if we

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
have jan

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
uh and our path to uh scott scott i

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
think

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
thank you my name is scott david i'm at

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
the university of washington

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
applied physics lab where i'm the

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,560
director

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
of information risk and synthetic

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,079
intelligence

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,878
research initiative delighted to be here

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,840
today

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
and i'd also i'm very very interested in

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,400
chatting about

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
the scale scale independent variables

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,319
and

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
how the interventions at one scale

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
can help to alter

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
system performances at other scales due

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
to fractal nature of

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
some of the affordances we're talking

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
about great interest to me

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,120
and i'll pass it to dave douglas i'm

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
in the philippines 120 miles north of

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
manila where it's cool because it's a

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
mile high city

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,480
and i just came across the answer to a

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
question what is a state

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
in the parcels and particles paper dr

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,519
fristen

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
says a state is a particle

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
so yes it really really is monads not

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
only all the way up but all the way down

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,800
to and uh who's left daniel you've

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
already we already know you

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
we'll go to we'll go to john thanks for

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,359
the the spicy introduction dave

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
i'm john boyk um

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
if you go to set two

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
slide one uh this

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,239
this series this these numerous talks

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
are on the topic of

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
science-driven societal transformation

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,519
that's the title of a

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
three-part series that i recently

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
published in the journal sustainability

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,879
um part one is world view part two

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
is motivation and strategy and part

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
three and three is design

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,440
i i i'm looking at societal

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
transformation through a particular lens

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
in this series and that lens is the de

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,760
novo

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,640
development of

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
fundamentally new systems so when i say

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,000
systems i'm talking

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
about the economic systems governance

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
systems legal systems

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
et cetera the

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
we're going to focus today i think on

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
maybe some of the practical

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
aspects like how would this be done

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
and uh i would like to just start by

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
saying just a few words about

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
this the kind of theory of change that i

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
talk about especially in

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
paper number two if i were

115
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
brilliant which i'm not and i came up

116
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,000
with this amazing new design for

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
societal systems new governance systems

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
etc

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
if there were no way to actually

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
practically implement that

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
then i it would have just been an

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
academic exercise

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
so part of this series is arguing that

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,280
there actually is

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
a reasonable way to move forward a a

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
viable path to move forward that is

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,639
doable that

128
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,120
that actually could be put into into

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
implementation

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
so this the series is is itself is

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,479
is essentially um outlining an r d

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,520
program for the development of this

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
framework to study and uh create and

134
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
develop and test

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,080
new integrated systems and that happens

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
at according to this theory of change

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
that happens at the

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
at the local level so the concept is is

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,120
that this r d

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
program is a is a collaboration between

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
the

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
global science community and

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
local communities and the new systems

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
are implemented at the local level on a

145
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
volunteer basis in what i call a club

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
model

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
so um the the concept there is that the

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,039
scientific community would have

149
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,840
developed

150
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
the tools and technologies and resources

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
and

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
things necessary to make these new

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
systems work well

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
uh and um they the

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,319
local communities some volunteer local

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
communities somewhere in the world would

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
would look at the results of all the

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
computer simulations and all the studies

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
that have been done and say that looks

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,160
interesting

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
gee it looks like our community might

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
really benefit from this

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
um uh let's give it a field trial let's

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
give it a try

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
and uh so that's the partnership and

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,759
then the

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
community itself now this could be i

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,039
don't mean a city i don't mean a

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,520
nation i really mean like perhaps a

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
subset of a city so

171
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
say just a thousand people or something

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
like that it might be enough

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
to start a club and the club would

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,960
function everyone in the club would

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,600
function

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
as normal in society except that on top

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
of

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
on top of you know there's another layer

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
of organization on top of the normal

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
layer of organization

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
and that's this club level so civic club

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
you can you can think of it as a

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,800
civic one and the civic club

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
has all these you know uh

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
ways that they go about decision making

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
and exchanging

187
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,520
currencies and various things that allow

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,919
them

189
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,440
then to test out these new frameworks of

190
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
of uh societal systems so that's the

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
gist of it and i just want to say a few

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
things about this club model before we

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
really get going just so we've kind of

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,759
all on the same page on that um

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
just before i do that maybe go to slide

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
two of that same deck

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
i'll point people to uh principled

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,840
societies project dot org if

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
they're looking for more information on

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
this

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
all of our videos are posted there and

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
the papers are posted there and there's

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,919
some other materials posted there

204
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,800
so for for information go to psp

205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,840
and let's go to slide 17.

206
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
okay

207
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,319
oh that is not the right uh not

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,840
quite the right one i wanted the theory

209
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
of change one and that's

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
not it

211
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,680
[Music]

212
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
uh which slide is that you're looking at

213
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,120
seventeen one yep

214
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
there you change you know that's somehow

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,319
i'm uh oh

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
oh here we go

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,599
yes there is change and strategy uh

218
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,879
uh this is just kind of uh

219
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,960
capturing what i just said the idea is

220
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,399
to implement new

221
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,958
fundamentally new systems at the club

222
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
level

223
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,679
uh i'll call the club a community but

224
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,958
this community could be

225
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
relatively small than just a portion of

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,720
the city and the reason i'm

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
one of the reasons i'm looking at the

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
club level is because i see it as kind

229
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
of the goldilocks level it's the

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,080
it's the smallest size

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,640
organization of a community that could

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
make the club

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
able to replicate right so and and

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
function

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
so if the if we were instead just

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
looking at say an individual business

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
that business like i say say i was

238
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
promoting a cooperative business model

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
or something like that

240
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720
that business would have to function

241
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
within the wider

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
set of businesses and would have to

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
compete in the

244
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
normal market for the consumer's

245
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
attention

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
and uh it would have a hard time doing

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
that because it's operating

248
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
according to some different set of rules

249
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
in a normal business

250
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,640
so the at the club level i see that as

251
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:36,959
just

252
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
large enough that all of these new

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
functional systems can be tested and

254
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
and it's large enough that the the

255
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
organization the community

256
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
can be self-replicating the club model

257
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
can be self-replicating

258
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
it can grow in a local area and the idea

259
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
can spread to other local areas

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
um uh all right

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
uh slide 19 please can we just go to

262
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,079
just lee and then scott just because

263
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
we're getting hands raised on each of

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
these slides so yeah so lee and then

265
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,279
scott

266
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
sure

267
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,760
john what are the um in order to start a

268
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
club

269
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
what are the minimum requirements that

270
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,440
are needed do they need any funding or

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
are there other set of conditions that

272
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,120
it might need

273
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,079
um ideally there wouldn't be any

274
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,600
requirements ideally there would be

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
support

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
from the from the you know the global

277
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
community to start a club but

278
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,519
but but the but the clubs are designed

279
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
such or at least

280
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
later we'll today we'll talk about a

281
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,000
simulation i did of a of a club model

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
a particular framework i called the lida

283
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
framework

284
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
but i designed that so that it could

285
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
bootstrap its own growth

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,320
so there was no it was not necessary

287
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
to you know for it for uh to reason

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
to have millions of dollars say to start

289
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
the club or anything like that it really

290
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,519
just grew

291
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
step by step exponentially fast so in

292
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
the first few years hardly anything was

293
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
happening

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
and then it started to grow you know

295
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
very rapidly after that

296
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
uh so you know what would be necessary

297
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,959
mostly just the

298
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
individuals that are that look at the

299
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,000
the

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
by the time a a field trial would ever

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,680
be started

302
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
there would have been you know let's say

303
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,720
hundreds of

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,440
papers scientific papers and simulations

305
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,000
and all other

306
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
aspects of this so everyone would know

307
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,360
what they're getting into this would be

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
very clear what the

309
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
what the you know what the new systems

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,680
are and what they do and how they

311
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
function

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,959
and then at that point all that would

313
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,720
really be necessary is for some

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
community somewhere in the world

315
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,399
to say oh that looks really interesting

316
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,760
let's do a field trial you know here's

317
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,839
we have a thousand people in our little

318
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
in our community that are interested in

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
this and let's give it a shot

320
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
so that's the main thing i mean maybe a

321
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
little bit of funding would be necessary

322
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
but not an extreme amount

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,680
so it sounds oh it sounds almost like

324
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
there's a prelude

325
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,200
phase which is the what we're in and

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,920
then

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
the stage will be set for proper

328
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
emergence for a community to then take

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,519
that next step

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
but um it's a really interesting

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,720
question about the viable

332
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
system so i hope that we pursue that

333
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
line as well

334
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,440
yeah john anything else and i did i just

335
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
maybe we'll add that by the time the

336
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
first field trial ever starts

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
there really should be no surprises

338
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
about any of this i mean

339
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
the community would you know conduct the

340
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,160
trial

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
but it should be a foregone conclusion

342
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
what's going to happen

343
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
as far as you know how it works and what

344
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,279
the benefits are

345
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,880
because this should have been worked out

346
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
very well already so

347
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
uh you know it shouldn't be as it's not

348
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
like uh here's a

349
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
you know here here's a new

350
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,399
here's a new machine a tractor or

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,200
something

352
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
now see if you can drive it it's not

353
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
quite like that because there would be

354
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
uh you know training involved we would

355
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
realize what the purpose of the tractor

356
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,880
is what

357
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,920
we're going to accomplish with the

358
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
tractor how it works how you repair it

359
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
you know like it would be a uh

360
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
again there's just should be very few

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
surprises by the time the first field

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
trial starts

363
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,079
that doesn't mean a community wouldn't

364
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
be able to make decisions on how it

365
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
what it funds and you know how it

366
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
functions of course the community

367
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
would make decisions about how about its

368
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
the kinds of jobs it creates and things

369
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
like that

370
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
but the fundamental mechanics mechanics

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,680
of the system should be pretty well

372
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
worked out

373
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
just very quickly then so is the um is

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
the particular community so you've got

375
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
this prelude phase where you're kind of

376
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
working out all the details of the de

377
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,079
novo design

378
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,440
is that done with the community oh

379
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
partly i mean that would be with any

380
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,480
communities

381
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,959
like globally in a sense that prelude

382
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,120
part is the global science community and

383
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
any

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
individuals or communities anywhere in

385
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
the world that want to participate

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
provide feedback do user testing

387
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
um you know all the little parts of the

388
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
systems would be also tested in various

389
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,079
groups and

390
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
there would be like really just a ton of

391
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,000
testing that would occur before the

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
before the first formal field trial ever

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
started

394
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,000
um and the and that particular community

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
what could have input on

396
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,959
um you know what kind of particular

397
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
design elements it might want in its

398
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,320
system

399
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,040
so and and that's actually a good point

400
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,639
that i'm glad you said that because

401
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,120
i also wanted to say that the purpose of

402
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,839
this r d

403
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
program is not to build one system that

404
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,040
fits

405
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,800
all it's to build it's it's an ongoing

406
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
exploration of

407
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,839
them you know different pieces and

408
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,120
approaches and

409
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
ways you might create systems

410
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,880
such that they fulfill their purpose so

411
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,839
there could be a

412
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
wide variety of you know

413
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
parts to choose from or ways to do

414
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,199
things or

415
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
you know hopefully there would be

416
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
numerous kinds and types

417
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
and pieces of systems that would be

418
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,199
tested over time that communities could

419
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,160
you know implement then and all with the

420
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,199
purpose of

421
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
of uh you know fit for purpose

422
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
you know all with it with the concept of

423
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
fit fit for purpose behind us

424
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
got and then anyone else who raises

425
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
their hands

426
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,959
i just wanted to go back you were

427
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
talking a little bit about the size of

428
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:29,680
groups

429
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
in the clubs it's a the optimization's

430
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
going to be really interesting because

431
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
you might have

432
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
and dunbar's number involved there that

433
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,880
dumbar's number concept being

434
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
the most people you can have as your

435
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
friend

436
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
kind of idea so whatever is 120 or

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,040
something but

438
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,079
one of the things that's interesting

439
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,360
also you have the internal voice

440
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
dynamics of the club plus the external

441
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
voice dynamics of the club

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
so as the club coheres an internal voice

443
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
it will have a more coherent external

444
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
voice which will allow it to entrain

445
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
and harmonically couple other systems

446
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
more effectively right because it'll be

447
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,759
more clear here and

448
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,880
one of the things that i'd like to get

449
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
into later in the conversation is we

450
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,519
have uh

451
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
some ideas we've been working on on

452
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
scaling how

453
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
legislative judicial and executive

454
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
function the three functions of all

455
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,600
governance systems have rule making

456
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
enforcement of the rules and operation

457
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
of the rules how those

458
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
naturally layer on just as a function of

459
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
scale

460
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
as you increase in scale from rule

461
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,360
making you have to go into different

462
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
abstractions for

463
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
enforcement and operation under those

464
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
rules and so that

465
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
would be very interesting to look at the

466
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
dynamics of club growth

467
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,800
as an internal process of internal voice

468
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,680
and a recognition of the layering on of

469
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,959
governance that occurs

470
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,759
internally and then how that governance

471
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,079
then

472
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
needs to expand into the external

473
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,360
environment

474
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
in order to be more effective the the

475
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,040
bottom line

476
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
is if you have a system a club where we

477
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,320
say

478
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,079
we are the free speech club we have the

479
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,680
rights to free speech

480
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
and there's no other club that has a

481
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
duty to respect that then you don't have

482
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
a right to free speech outside of the

483
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
club

484
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,000
right and say how do you iterate the

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,359
story

486
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
outside of the club so that it becomes a

487
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
reality that's shared so it can be

488
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,559
enjoyed

489
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
right right i'd like to talk about that

490
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,240
yeah yeah there's there's a there's a

491
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
ton there that we

492
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,480
go through uh i have these concepts in

493
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,119
mind

494
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
as i was designing these systems or

495
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,559
designing the frameworks so

496
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,679
all good points um just a little bit on

497
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,280
size i'll try to

498
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
talk about a couple of things briefly

499
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
that you raised a little bit on size

500
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
um so so in

501
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
our brains we have a community of

502
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,520
neurons that are

503
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,600
that are functioning to help the body

504
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,880
make decisions and

505
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
that that community of neurons is very

506
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
much connected with the rest of the body

507
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,799
also

508
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
feet and the liver and the heart and

509
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
everything else

510
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
well how does all of that you know how

511
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,919
does

512
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
how do all those cells and tissues and

513
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,520
organisms

514
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,960
cooperate together to make the body

515
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,440
function the way the body functions

516
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
one thing that happens is there's a very

517
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
rich stream of communication that is

518
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,559
passing between

519
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
all these different cells and tissues

520
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,559
and things for hormonal signals and

521
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,039
small molecule signals and blood is

522
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,280
circulating and there's all these

523
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
this awash in signals and communication

524
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
so uh communication

525
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,919
is one of the prerequisites for

526
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,200
any kind of large organized

527
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
you know instead of individuals

528
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,919
whether they're cells or whether they're

529
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,760
people to function together

530
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
so one of the questions that we can talk

531
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
about today

532
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,200
um is what kinds of tools are necessary

533
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,799
to allow for rich communication to occur

534
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,919
in say a group of let's just say 10 000

535
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
people or a hundred thousand people or a

536
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,559
million people

537
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,679
how do how does a large group of people

538
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,960
come together

539
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
richly communicate their narrative their

540
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,080
story

541
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
their their both you know

542
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,919
i want to tell i want to tell my group

543
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
what is happening for me

544
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,919
what i anticipate will happen if we

545
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,559
choose a

546
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,600
over b over c uh where this might lead

547
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
in the short run where this might lead

548
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,840
in the

549
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,520
long run how this fits into other issues

550
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,400
issues d and e and f i mean you know i'm

551
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
an intelligent person

552
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
everyone else has intelligence and um

553
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
that intelligence can be used in the

554
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,960
group

555
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,360
uh cognitive you know the group

556
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,400
cognition

557
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
in order for the group to make wise

558
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,520
choices about

559
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,080
you know actions and and where they want

560
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
to put their attention

561
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,440
so so the tool question is a big one

562
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
and i would say that that currently

563
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
there are no tools

564
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,280
that allow a large group of individuals

565
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,480
to come together to collaborate with

566
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
via rich communication and rich

567
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
storytelling

568
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
right we that doesn't exist yet i would

569
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
say and i have ideas on how we might

570
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,559
create that but that's one of the

571
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,440
that's one of the one of the tasks that

572
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,240
would have to happen

573
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
over the over the first several years of

574
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
the program

575
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,159
is addressing that particular problem of

576
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
how does a group richly communicate

577
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
and collaborate and making decisions so

578
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
so if we're just talking to get to your

579
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
point now

580
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
if we're if we just have a small group

581
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,280
and we're just

582
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
just talking we're working out things

583
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
we're making decisions together

584
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
well maybe that group can't be more than

585
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,400
a few people before it starts to fall

586
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
apart or you know maybe it can't be more

587
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
than 10 or 20 or 100 people or something

588
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,440
um

589
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,679
but if we have some way to richly

590
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,240
communicate then maybe we can scale that

591
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
you know we can scale that communication

592
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,280
uh to a larger group to thousands or ten

593
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,080
thousands

594
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,000
and still there might be some limit be

595
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
beyond what a club wouldn't

596
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
you know like maybe a club should never

597
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
be more than a hundred thousand or

598
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
never more than a million or never more

599
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
than ten thousand you know who knows

600
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,799
and so that's between that's of

601
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,000
individuals in a club

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
and then there should be similar

603
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,159
communication between clubs

604
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
that must happen and that's getting to a

605
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
that's touching another point that you

606
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
raised is

607
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,320
how do how does a club reach reach the

608
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,280
you know interact with the wider world

609
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,159
and

610
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,840
the the both and and the

611
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
my framing both with other clubs how

612
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
how does decision making occur between

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,720
clubs how does communication happen

614
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
between clubs and then also how does

615
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
communication happen with

616
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
the rest of the world thanks john

617
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
um stephen and then scott and then

618
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,799
anyone else who raises their hand

619
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,640
yeah thanks i i think i'm interested by

620
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,360
this um

621
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
the word purpose you know we think about

622
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,880
purpose and all of this

623
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,760
and clubs tend to have a particular

624
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,320
uh focus or purpose as you're mentioning

625
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,799
and

626
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,320
i think it's interesting you're bringing

627
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,360
in the science

628
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,159
intentionality you know the

629
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,240
intentionality of the science community

630
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
to enable

631
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,720
sort of seeding so i'm wondering how

632
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,840
that might you might think about that

633
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,960
sitting alongside say

634
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
community organizations or like

635
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
community hubs for instance that or

636
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,799
multi-service agencies

637
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,280
in the community or nodes of support

638
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,559
those types of things this might be

639
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,159
something which could fit in there and

640
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
give this kind of

641
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,919
club purpose that might

642
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,039
complement or is it different

643
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
similar to some of those types of

644
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,720
service provisions

645
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,080
that exist out in towns and cities

646
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,440
i'm not exactly sure

647
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
the question you're pointing to but let

648
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
me say a few things and maybe i'm going

649
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,720
to touch on it

650
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,240
um so so

651
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
um kind of in the abstract

652
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,400
the the you know the concept behind this

653
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
whole

654
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,200
program is that um

655
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
that that an organism has an intrinsic

656
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
purpose and that trans

657
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
intrinsic purpose is to thrive both now

658
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,840
and

659
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
in the future so expected thriving and

660
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,760
uh in order to do that it uses cognition

661
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
right and via cognition and we've talked

662
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
about how active inference fits in

663
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
to that whole picture via cognition it

664
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,760
really reduces the uncertainty about its

665
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
capacity to thrive it's

666
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,679
the essential variables that it you know

667
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
that it that it needs that it

668
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
functions the world it functions in and

669
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,840
whether it's need true needs will be met

670
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
right so

671
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
uh that's an organism and i'm viewing a

672
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,480
society as an organism right

673
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
so in the sort of the larger picture the

674
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,080
abstract

675
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
little abstract the

676
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
question is you know is is a community

677
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,840
functioning in a way is a new system

678
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
functioning in a way that is reducing

679
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,039
uncertainty about the capacity to thrive

680
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,240
so that's that's uh that would be

681
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
yeah that would be you know uh

682
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
implemented in a way via some kind of

683
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
fitness metrics

684
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,000
so just like in normal society in a

685
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,880
regular society we have say gdp

686
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
and other various types of you know

687
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
information we gather and metrics that

688
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840
we use there would be a set of metrics

689
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
that would go along with this whole

690
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
program so that a community would know

691
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
how it's doing and how it will

692
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,200
how it can expect to be doing two years

693
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
from now and five years from now and

694
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,279
ten years from now you know maybe even

695
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
20 years from now

696
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,520
so so there may be many

697
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
subgroups within say that say that

698
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
there's a club and the club is 10 000

699
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,760
people

700
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,520
for example clearly there would be some

701
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
groups within that club that would be

702
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,039
interested in various

703
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,240
aspects of you know

704
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,760
topics or ways of doing things or

705
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
various kinds of communication

706
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,120
and you know maybe some some

707
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
subgroups are really focused on the

708
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
social

709
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,480
components of the community components

710
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
the you know maybe emotional components

711
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,080
social components

712
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,159
and then other groups are interested in

713
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
technical components and

714
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,720
modeling or whatever you know other

715
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,919
other groups are interested in the

716
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,880
environmental components for example

717
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
well that's great that's you know

718
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
association between groups is a part of

719
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
cognition our neurons associate

720
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,640
in in ways that allows for cognition of

721
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,120
the whole

722
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,600
and in the same way a you know club in a

723
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
community would do the same

724
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,679
so there could be all kinds of subgroups

725
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
that are all functioning but the

726
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,400
umbrella purpose would be present right

727
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
because it would be reported daily say

728
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,200
or

729
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
even hourly or weekly you know there

730
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
would be everyone would know how

731
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
how we're doing as a whole and that

732
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
we're all in this together

733
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
to raise our our joint

734
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
capacity to thrive and and maintain our

735
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,200
maintain our ability to thrive so yes

736
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,559
there would be all kinds of groups that

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,679
would focus on different

738
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,039
aspects of this and the umbrella

739
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
you know reporting and collecting of

740
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
information would be happening still

741
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,240
across groups across the community so

742
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
that there would be some sense of how

743
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,640
are we doing

744
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,440
and what's going to happen next you can

745
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,159
i just reply

746
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,520
slightly to that yeah just very good

747
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
yeah just that's really interesting and

748
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
it sounds as well

749
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,520
this could tie in with the kind of

750
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,919
another type of evaluative capacity

751
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,400
or ongoing rolling evaluative capacity

752
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
but with an agent based or

753
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
active inference based

754
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,440
engine so to speak so that it's giving

755
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
this

756
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,960
update to communities around

757
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,080
how they are progressing

758
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,960
so to speak when that may help them in

759
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,279
other areas some of which may be

760
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,039
outside of the club's

761
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,720
more bounded area you know it gets into

762
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,559
the niche and complexity

763
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,440
so the interesting if you thought about

764
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,159
this might be

765
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,880
how this might link in with some of the

766
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
new developments in evaluative

767
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
evaluation going on and that might be

768
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
quite a good avenue

769
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,559
yeah there would be i mean if you were

770
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,720
going to collect information

771
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
uh and and assess how we're doing and

772
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
what's going to happen next there would

773
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,480
be all kinds of

774
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,720
evaluation that would have to occur not

775
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
just on the simple things like you could

776
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,840
think of some simple things right off

777
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,240
the bat

778
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
like do we have enough food do we have

779
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,919
enough water well fine but humans are

780
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:10,640
complex

781
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,080
organisms we have complex needs social

782
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
needs

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
you know emotional needs you know like

784
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
physical needs

785
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,760
you know we and all of those needs

786
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
should be taken into account

787
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,440
in in some kind of you know

788
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
comprehensive evaluation of how are we

789
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
doing and what's going to happen next

790
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
and and obviously every any organism has

791
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,000
to know that you know

792
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
every organism wants to know it needs to

793
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
assess its status like how

794
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
am i how am i doing am i too cold am i

795
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,320
too hot am i hap

796
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
unhappy am i happy you know like every

797
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
organism needs to do that

798
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,080
and a community a community as an

799
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,279
organism needs to do that

800
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
cool thanks john also welcome blue and

801
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
on the the goldilocks

802
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
note and this narrative note i really

803
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,799
like what scott had said about the

804
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,600
internal and

805
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
external communications and as internal

806
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,279
communications

807
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,000
become structured from a connections

808
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
perspective but also from a narrative

809
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,159
perspective

810
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,120
the external interfaces and narratives

811
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
can be structured so goldilocks

812
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
doesn't just evoke the um sort of

813
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
upside-down u-curve i mean this is

814
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,320
something that we know from

815
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
pharmacology from temperature everything

816
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
there's too much and there's too little

817
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,919
and there's a failure mode on either

818
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,919
side just like a bowling alley and of

819
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,279
course the middle solution is

820
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
going to be better it just wears the

821
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
middle but goldilocks also reminds us

822
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,120
that

823
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,919
that middle solution has to be more like

824
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,799
a child's

825
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,679
story rather than some sort of ab truce

826
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,480
optimization

827
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,039
problem so it's kind of a fun reference

828
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,279
that it should be comprehensible

829
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,840
internally and also externally in order

830
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,639
to be functional

831
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,080
right right right so yeah and it may be

832
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,720
just to

833
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,919
touch on that you know from this to say

834
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,520
the scientific viewpoint

835
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,000
one might think about fitness and you

836
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
know in terms of

837
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,279
metrics and statistics and things like

838
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,640
that but

839
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
other people won't relate maybe so much

840
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,080
to that

841
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,240
kind of assessment so everyone who's

842
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
involved has to

843
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
there has to be a way to communicate the

844
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,200
ideas of how are we doing and

845
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,720
and you know what is our status

846
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
in ways that are meaningful to everyone

847
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,200
involved or else if it's not meaningful

848
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,399
will really won't

849
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,679
work right so so some some people might

850
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,799
might discuss uh you know status in very

851
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,399
technical terms and other people might

852
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,240
discuss status

853
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
and more say emotional terms or social

854
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
terms or something like that

855
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,200
but but the general sense the general

856
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
the general purpose has to make sense to

857
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,159
everyone or else

858
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,880
why be a part of this one other thing on

859
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,919
the goldilocks

860
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,720
is the question is um

861
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,120
to be clear it's not my intent that a

862
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,600
club say a club started in in houston

863
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,480
texas

864
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
with a thousand people it's not my

865
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
intent

866
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
that the club would stay at a thousand

867
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
people it would grow

868
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,559
if the whole concept of this is that if

869
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,120
this

870
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,279
this new model this new club model these

871
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,559
new frameworks

872
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,799
actually work if they actually empower a

873
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,559
community to

874
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,519
do better to to have be more secure to

875
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,320
have

876
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,399
a higher quality of life to have

877
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
economic security to

878
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
you know in numerous ways if these clubs

879
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,120
benefit the population

880
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
the way i think it would then they would

881
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,320
grow because it's

882
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,760
kind of like the you know why don't we

883
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,039
use typewriters anymore

884
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,320
because we have computers

885
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
that work so much better i mean they're

886
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,440
just so much better

887
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
who would want to use a typewriter you

888
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
know that kind of thing so which

889
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,320
that's the concept of this it should be

890
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
so easy to join a club it should be so

891
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,399
easy to participate

892
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,600
that that like why not

893
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,399
my life will be better if i participate

894
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,519
in a club and if that's

895
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,320
if that comes true if it really works as

896
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,519
advertised

897
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,440
then clubs will grow and the club model

898
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
will spread to other places and then

899
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,519
instead of having a club of ten thousand

900
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,039
or one thousand you have a club of a

901
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,399
hundred thousand and

902
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,799
every city has a club and pretty soon

903
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,679
the you know

904
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,600
much of the world is starting to

905
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
function along these

906
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
you know with these with this along with

907
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,360
these new systems much of the world is

908
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
engaging with them or enough of the

909
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,480
world is engaging with them that the

910
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
ideas behind them suddenly become the

911
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
start to become the dominant ideas

912
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,320
so that the goal is not to help a

913
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,840
community so much the goal is to

914
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
actually transform

915
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
globally society or at least semi

916
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,720
globally

917
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,399
thanks john i'm gonna ask a question

918
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,640
from the chat and then stephen and lee

919
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,519
so in the chat natalia writes i read in

920
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,080
the paper

921
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
thanks for reading the paper natalia

922
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
that people would keep their income

923
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,399
when not working i'm curious what role

924
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,559
motivation plays in the success of the

925
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,279
system

926
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,880
and what kinds of structures are in

927
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
place to manage that so

928
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,840
agent level motivations and how do we

929
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
design incentive structures and

930
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
ecosystems for participation

931
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
that are able to incentivize various

932
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,080
kinds of participants

933
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,880
all right okay so so what what you know

934
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,640
what motivates us today in our

935
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,000
economy um you know a variety of things

936
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,080
we're complex organisms we're motivated

937
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
by a variety of things

938
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,799
but a large one because the way the

939
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,840
system is designed

940
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,399
is that if you don't participate if you

941
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
don't go out there and get some kind of

942
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,399
job you're gonna be in the street you

943
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
know there's this like

944
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,399
this kind of you know

945
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,760
you're forced to participate and if you

946
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
don't and if you don't you're going to

947
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
be in trouble

948
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,080
well well that's not very useful uh for

949
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,720
many reasons

950
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,440
far more useful is to offer people what

951
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,480
they actually

952
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,039
really want what what humans tend to

953
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
really want which is

954
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
a variety of things they want to help

955
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,760
each other they want

956
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,200
to be part of a community they want to

957
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,359
learn they want to develop skills they

958
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,399
want to

959
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,280
do any number of things that engage them

960
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,399
with each other and

961
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,440
in they want to solve problems they want

962
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,040
to be a part of a problem-solving

963
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,399
process they want

964
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,839
to they want to you know cooperate

965
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
it makes us happy to cooperate right all

966
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,879
of nature

967
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
is cooperating like this cooperation is

968
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,359
the rule rather than the

969
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,879
the exception in nature so how can we

970
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,560
build a system

971
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,199
that just allows us to really be

972
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,359
ourselves to really

973
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,960
get what we want most want right like

974
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
i want to be in a in a kind

975
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,359
and cooperative and functional

976
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,159
uh setting a group i want to work with

977
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,520
each other i want to work with the

978
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,800
people around me and

979
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,280
and help each other and they want to

980
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
help me and

981
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
so how do we make that happen at scale

982
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,040
right that's the question and uh

983
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,359
so the motivation isn't to get rich i

984
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,880
mean we'll talk about the leader

985
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,160
framework in a little while and that's

986
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,240
just one example of a way to organize an

987
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
economic system but

988
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,480
but that particular system actually

989
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,200
achieves

990
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,079
uh income equality over time so clearly

991
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,400
the

992
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
motivation isn't to make money like

993
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,240
that's not why you're engaged in the

994
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,200
economic system

995
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,320
the economic system is only a it's

996
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,800
really

997
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,839
a uh it's a cognitive system not a not a

998
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,280
money system

999
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,079
money is just a tool that's used as a as

1000
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:38,800
a way to

1001
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,240
share information right um so in the

1002
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,040
in the leader framework incomes equalize

1003
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
over time and the motivation to engage

1004
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,640
is to be to fulfill all these deeper

1005
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,160
human needs that we all have

1006
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
thanks for the response john so stephen

1007
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,839
and then lee

1008
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
yeah i'll just sort of carrying on a bit

1009
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
from what you're just saying there

1010
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,320
with um the community getting involved

1011
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,440
and

1012
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
their benefits to the purpose and to

1013
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
their motivation

1014
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,599
at the community level um that is a

1015
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,960
missing link at the moment

1016
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,520
in terms of and it probably was much

1017
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,440
more present even 100 years ago

1018
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,920
80 years ago you'd have had the women's

1019
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,359
institute and you had all sorts of

1020
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:27,920
different

1021
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,560
so we professionalized an awful lot of

1022
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,359
roles

1023
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,359
okay and you see that with nursing and

1024
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,400
all sorts of

1025
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
professions where they've increasingly

1026
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,000
professionalized and trained

1027
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,200
so the question i've got there

1028
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
is how do you um

1029
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,760
bring in the motivations of the

1030
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,280
professionals

1031
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,680
who have another niche that they're

1032
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,520
trying to optimize around maybe writing

1033
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,040
papers getting a career

1034
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,119
and things like this and

1035
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,880
do they have to be humble

1036
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
in some way to honor the input from this

1037
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,440
community

1038
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
because obviously you're trying to

1039
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
invert some of the

1040
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
assumptions about where everything

1041
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
should be located i.e

1042
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,920
it doesn't need to all be driven by

1043
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
professions and just keep driving

1044
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,480
more professions that you can bring in

1045
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
community input and wisdom

1046
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,119
to also be part of that through these

1047
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,280
clubs but how do you

1048
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
marry that the types of niches that

1049
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,400
people are in

1050
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,599
and the competition for their time and

1051
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,400
right right um i don't i don't actually

1052
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,880
see

1053
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,680
that as too much of a problem let's just

1054
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
let's just pick a profession

1055
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,320
uh say nursing or something like that

1056
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,160
and then the question becomes uh let's

1057
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
say that i live in houston and the club

1058
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,560
has started and

1059
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
why would i want to you know i'm a

1060
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,599
professional i make a

1061
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,800
reasonable salary let's say

1062
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,320
why would i want to participate in a

1063
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
club

1064
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
well there might be numerous reasons i

1065
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,599
might see

1066
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,599
i might understand the potential of the

1067
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
club i mean you know there's this whole

1068
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,359
body of literature now these simulations

1069
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
and other literature that

1070
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
suggests that this club model might

1071
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
actually empower the

1072
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
people who belong to a club to make

1073
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,680
better decisions

1074
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
to achieve you know higher environmental

1075
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,040
quality

1076
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,280
and higher social quality so i might be

1077
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
interested

1078
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,280
uh just to join for that reason because

1079
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
i see it as a beneficial thing for the

1080
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,720
larger community right i can engage with

1081
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,079
these people and make decisions and

1082
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
together we can

1083
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,640
you know make beautiful things happen uh

1084
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,119
but

1085
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,640
let's now let's focus just on the

1086
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,240
economic aspect

1087
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,520
and again uh you know there what might

1088
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,160
be any

1089
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,800
number of ways to design any of these

1090
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
systems economic systems governance

1091
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,280
systems you know

1092
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
there could be all kinds of concepts

1093
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,320
that we that the r d program could

1094
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
assess and try and test out right but of

1095
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
the in the leader framework the kind of

1096
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
prototypical economic system that we

1097
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,920
hopefully will

1098
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,839
get to talking about here um

1099
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,720
um the question becomes how do we get

1100
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,760
from here to there

1101
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,119
like how do we get from today's society

1102
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,640
and incomes and structure to

1103
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,160
some other structure you know

1104
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,720
down the road right so i try to show

1105
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
that in the simulation that model that i

1106
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,599
published

1107
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,640
it goes over a 30-year period so

1108
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,160
so again the kind of the expansion of

1109
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,839
the club and its activities is

1110
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,040
exponential

1111
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,440
so maybe in the first few years there's

1112
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,119
not a whole lot happenings

1113
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,280
people join but you know there's not big

1114
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
effects but then

1115
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
these it bootstraps itself economically

1116
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,400
and otherwise and then they're starting

1117
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,839
to be bigger effects

1118
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,480
so uh you know just kind of jumping to

1119
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,240
the chase a little bit

1120
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,280
in the leader framework it's designed so

1121
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,000
that incomes rise over time right and

1122
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,960
and

1123
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,400
the the people in the simulation people

1124
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,280
only join

1125
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,960
if they're going to be better off

1126
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,119
economically otherwise there's no reason

1127
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,839
to join in the simulation

1128
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,960
so um i i

1129
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,560
let's say i'm a nurse i have a pretty

1130
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,400
good income why would i join

1131
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,839
well if i join at any point

1132
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,839
i will get a babes like a um

1133
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,480
and my income is high the let's say the

1134
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,880
inc

1135
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
the lowest target income

1136
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,319
is rising but my income is still higher

1137
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,280
than that

1138
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
i can still join and i'll get a kind of

1139
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,280
a

1140
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,319
i'll get a a small a small bonus

1141
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,319
uh that's not the word i use in the

1142
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,079
paper but it's kind of like that i i'll

1143
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,280
get a i'll get a say

1144
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,960
i don't know what let's just say a

1145
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,119
thousand dollars a year for joining

1146
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,560
well that's a thousand dollars a year

1147
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,319
that i didn't have otherwise so i

1148
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,400
even i get a even though my income is

1149
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
high relative to where this

1150
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,440
income target is growing i still get a

1151
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,119
benefit from it and then i get to use

1152
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,880
that money and that you know that part

1153
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
of it is a local

1154
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
currency so i get to use the dollar

1155
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,920
dollar currency the

1156
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,359
national currency and this local

1157
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,200
currency in the decision making process

1158
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,319
and i'm engaged you know

1159
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,160
i have i have some skin in the game now

1160
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,119
and then as that uh income rises at some

1161
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
point it's likely to

1162
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
reach mine or go above what my current

1163
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,119
income is and then for sure i want to

1164
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,960
join because if i join my incomes you

1165
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,480
know like my annual income is going to

1166
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:30,880
rise

1167
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,319
maybe substantially so the in the

1168
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,400
in the simulation the income target

1169
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
rises up to about

1170
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,640
uh somewhere around 110 the equivalent

1171
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,319
of about 110 000

1172
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,359
per year per family so

1173
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,760
you know that's more than some nurses

1174
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,480
make

1175
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,359
uh and especially for those nurses that

1176
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,400
are at the bottom level

1177
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,280
bottom you know economic level or

1178
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,079
teachers or

1179
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,280
firemen or police or whatever you know

1180
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,400
uh there would be motivation to join

1181
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,880
because

1182
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
your income is going to not only

1183
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
increase but become stable like you

1184
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,280
don't have to

1185
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,520
if you lose your job there's no worries

1186
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,880
you're going to be taken care of this

1187
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,839
system

1188
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,960
is circulating currency in such a way

1189
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,520
that

1190
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,920
once you're in you're okay it doesn't

1191
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
matter if you're working or not

1192
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,720
it it's john it's it's a way to rethink

1193
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,520
this um

1194
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,200
driven by money versus not driven by

1195
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
money because you've really said it both

1196
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,760
ways you've said

1197
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,440
people are not motivated by money yet

1198
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
you've repeatedly appealed to the idea

1199
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,800
that every person will gain more money

1200
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
and implicitly that that's what is

1201
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,040
important

1202
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
and so it's actually just it is what it

1203
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,160
is

1204
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
and that's where active inference and

1205
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,119
all these other techniques and extended

1206
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,560
cognition come into play

1207
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,760
because there'll be a variety of

1208
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,440
narratives for people who are in

1209
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,160
different

1210
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,040
positions so we'll go to lee and then

1211
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,240
scott and then i'll ask a question in

1212
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
the chat

1213
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,560
uh yeah so um it's kind of a related

1214
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,520
point actually

1215
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,640
so uh in the paper um

1216
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,720
i remember you were reading that at one

1217
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,000
point you're talking about you know

1218
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,400
effectively as the dinobo system

1219
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,319
uh starts to out compete the native

1220
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,160
system you know there are

1221
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,079
gonna be winners and losers effectively

1222
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,680
so you know if you're a franchise owner

1223
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,319
of a

1224
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,680
of a mcdonald's or something you know

1225
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
your cheap labor disappears

1226
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,480
so on a larger scale right that means

1227
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,440
that

1228
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,640
you know they're um

1229
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,800
well i guess what i'm what i'm i'm

1230
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
asking is do you anticipate that

1231
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,839
ultimately the current system you know

1232
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,160
with

1233
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
lots of vested interests to remain the

1234
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,680
way it is he's going to start pushing

1235
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,359
back once it realizes

1236
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,560
that this kind of club model is

1237
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,520
potentially a threat to it

1238
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,800
yeah so right so it's true there's

1239
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,079
winners and losers in this

1240
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,760
and the and in a sense

1241
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,480
if if if you're measuring winners and

1242
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,359
losers by

1243
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,920
does this civilization survive and

1244
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,760
thrive well then there's hardly any

1245
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,800
losers because

1246
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,079
you know the the whole concept of this

1247
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,839
is so that societies and civilization

1248
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
can thrive into the future right and

1249
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,119
that's not

1250
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,560
and you know just as a counterpoint

1251
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,720
that's not our current system

1252
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,400
you know we're our current system is

1253
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,560
essentially on a suicide

1254
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,720
uh route you know trajectory of

1255
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,119
destroying life on the planet so

1256
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,160
the current system is not working

1257
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,400
uh and you know it's not working in the

1258
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
sense of our

1259
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
insecurity about will we even be here in

1260
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,319
a hundred years is

1261
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,839
is quite high right so uh but but in a

1262
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,359
in another sense yes there will be

1263
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,240
losers and winners so the idea is that

1264
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,119
this r d program is creating and testing

1265
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,599
new

1266
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,319
ways of organizing society that really

1267
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:44,640
do

1268
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
that really function well and any

1269
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,720
organism that functions well is going to

1270
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,960
out compete other organisms you know

1271
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,720
that are not functioning well right

1272
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,040
in that sense so um a community say that

1273
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
is using these tools and using these

1274
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
systems and it's really flourishing

1275
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
uh probably we'll be doing flourishing

1276
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,760
more than other communities that aren't

1277
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,119
and that's the reason that other

1278
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,800
communities might say hey that looks

1279
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,280
good

1280
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,240
but let's do that now you have a subset

1281
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,119
of say

1282
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,640
you know multi-millionaires and

1283
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,880
billionaires and

1284
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
at least on some perspective they will

1285
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,319
be losers because

1286
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,359
uh you know that that's not gonna

1287
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,200
work that's not gonna be compatible with

1288
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,440
this new way of doing things

1289
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,079
uh and you raised one of the reasons why

1290
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,280
i wouldn't be compatible

1291
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,599
is that where are they going to get

1292
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,640
their low-wage

1293
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,880
workers to work and you know work in

1294
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,640
their factories and stuff

1295
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,480
where are they going to come from if all

1296
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,079
the other folks are

1297
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,960
having high-wage jobs in these new you

1298
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,359
know

1299
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,640
these new systems right these new

1300
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,920
frameworks so the the business model

1301
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,079
will start to falter the conventional

1302
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,359
business model will start to

1303
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,400
start to falter and as it should because

1304
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,160
you know that what what are we what are

1305
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,760
we doing here what is the what are we

1306
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,520
doing in society right are

1307
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,560
don't we want to flourish don't we want

1308
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,000
systems that help us to to reduce our

1309
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,599
uncertainty and flourish into the future

1310
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,640
well i i would think we do overall right

1311
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,680
so systems that don't do that really

1312
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,400
have to

1313
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,359
fall by the wayside or or transform

1314
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,640
themselves into into

1315
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,200
new systems that do function better and

1316
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,560
the the long-term

1317
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,960
aim of this r d program isn't

1318
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,160
necessarily that

1319
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,079
the world will be using these kinds of

1320
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,760
systems another

1321
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,800
option another you know potential

1322
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,280
future is that current governance

1323
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,640
systems current

1324
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,119
legal systems current financial systems

1325
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:43,760
you know

1326
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
uh all of our current systems might

1327
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,200
learn from these experience

1328
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,960
these experiments everywhere and go you

1329
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,319
know what that's that's actually a good

1330
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,839
idea that works well let's

1331
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,880
incorporate that into our structure and

1332
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
uh you know we'll be better off everyone

1333
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,640
will be better off so that would be fun

1334
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
maybe that maybe the clubs

1335
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,599
grow to a point around the world and

1336
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,240
they just

1337
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,880
they the ideas just assimilate out into

1338
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,800
the larger world that are taken up and

1339
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,000
then everyone is still doing

1340
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,079
better so that would be great or maybe

1341
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,680
it doesn't go that way maybe

1342
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,400
maybe it becomes a you know like us

1343
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,920
against them in a sense there's the

1344
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,119
clubs that are growing

1345
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,559
the the native systems the current

1346
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,400
systems are not doing well

1347
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,640
they refuse to learn from these

1348
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,400
experience experiments they're they're

1349
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,760
not interested in change

1350
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,119
well then they probably will be

1351
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,119
dinosaurs you know

1352
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,200
i mean i'm just thinking about uh so

1353
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,280
there are examples of um

1354
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,440
a community energy generation for

1355
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,040
example so those solutions

1356
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,920
start to exist um you know and then

1357
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,200
there are examples

1358
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,640
of invested interests where they've kind

1359
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
of seen that as a potential threat

1360
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,559
and move to outlaw them so i mean it's

1361
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,240
just those kind of you know it's it's

1362
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,440
those kind of conflicts

1363
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,480
i was wondering where they might yeah

1364
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,680
you know um of course those kinds of

1365
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,960
conflicts will happen

1366
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,760
um and the and the r d program and the

1367
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,599
people involved and creating this whole

1368
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
system have to think these things

1369
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,839
through

1370
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,119
carefully to try to avoid you know

1371
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,160
problems that might be foreseen right

1372
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,400
obviously so these are very important

1373
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,280
questions and

1374
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,800
we would have to give a lot of thought

1375
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,640
as to how we

1376
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,319
you know skirt past these problems now

1377
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,800
you know and and i you know i don't

1378
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,760
that's to be done

1379
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
that's work to be done right i have a

1380
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,599
few ideas

1381
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,359
and that's and i and i can say that's

1382
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,280
one of the reasons i wanted the global

1383
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,119
science community as a kind of a

1384
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,920
you know co-leader in this whole process

1385
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,480
because

1386
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,599
it is for one thing it's global right

1387
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,480
it's not

1388
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,040
limited to the laws of a particular

1389
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
nation

1390
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,720
so and it's authoritative in the sense

1391
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,119
that

1392
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,599
we can write papers and we can do

1393
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,800
simulations and we can

1394
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,440
talk with some authority of it would

1395
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,400
this be a good

1396
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,640
you know do these things help humans

1397
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,000
would this be good for human

1398
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,079
societies and civilization you know we

1399
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,160
can we can do we can do that we can

1400
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,040
we're independent of any particular

1401
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,240
nation in a

1402
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
sense um

1403
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,680
and then suppose that there's a nation

1404
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,520
that says no way this is against the law

1405
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,559
you can't do it here well

1406
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,200
okay you can't do it there but there

1407
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,720
will be other nations that

1408
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,520
wouldn't have those rules and this club

1409
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,359
model can thrive wherever it's allowed

1410
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,640
to thrive right and

1411
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,079
you would think that there would be some

1412
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,880
nation somewhere in this world where

1413
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,920
there might be some allowance for these

1414
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,119
kinds of social experiments to occur

1415
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,960
and once it works that's the thing

1416
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,480
that's the concept is that once it's

1417
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,240
shown to work

1418
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,920
you know first in one community say and

1419
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,680
then maybe in two and then four and then

1420
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,559
eight

1421
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,400
you know once it's once it looks like

1422
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,760
this actually works

1423
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,160
then there's a whole nother slew of of

1424
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,160
papers and simulations showing you know

1425
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,960
like working

1426
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,040
you know assessing that and that

1427
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,520
information is broadcast to the world

1428
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,359
and uh you know at some point it becomes

1429
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,160
harder and harder for a society to

1430
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,359
to keep it out because

1431
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,040
you know no no no country

1432
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,800
uses typewriters anymore you know

1433
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,000
except the hipster countries so we have

1434
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,040
except they have except the except the

1435
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,000
hipsters

1436
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,119
they'll say i want that good

1437
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,200
old-fashioned government so

1438
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,359
scott and then a question from chat and

1439
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,759
then dave

1440
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,040
so um great conversation thank you this

1441
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,520
is so

1442
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,760
fascinating so the couple of book

1443
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,280
references and a couple

1444
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,640
of things i'm going to talk a little bit

1445
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,640
about money and risk here going back to

1446
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,520
what we were talking about a little

1447
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
while ago and that moved from

1448
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,800
money and prosperity you know there's a

1449
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,640
book by i think it's hannah's men called

1450
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,079
doing money

1451
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,640
where the author suggests that money is

1452
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,839
a universal risk

1453
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:01,759
consolidator and so i'll hold up here

1454
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,000
20 billion okay okay

1455
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,960
due to the bearer upon react so it only

1456
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,480
is as good as the narrative

1457
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,280
right so um i always carry zimbabwe

1458
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,960
money around because that's inflation

1459
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,400
protected in the united states

1460
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,720
we can't get near the inflation rates of

1461
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,400
this so um

1462
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,640
the the reason i raise that is money you

1463
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,400
know we there's a book called the past

1464
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,760
as a foreign country

1465
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,200
where we think people in the past oh

1466
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,200
they just didn't get it and

1467
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,119
then we look at this and go you know

1468
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,720
money actually

1469
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,920
it's interesting when people want to

1470
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,280
accumulate money there's a lot of

1471
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,319
theories of money this

1472
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,480
smith and wixel and hume but money is a

1473
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,079
form of communication between people

1474
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,319
it's an encoding of risk

1475
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,760
in a sense right when we look at and

1476
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,319
decoding of risk and a universal

1477
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,520
risk encoding in a sense and

1478
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,800
it's kind of interesting because then it

1479
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,720
becomes abstracted into its own

1480
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,920
get its own end that's when it

1481
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,800
comes the commodity of money right and

1482
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,559
so it's not a medium of communication in

1483
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,880
exchange anymore but its own

1484
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,559
gain its own because it's used

1485
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,160
generically against all risks i can

1486
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,800
de-risk

1487
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,559
so many universal risks that's pretty

1488
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,000
true it's like a universal solvent of

1489
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,800
water

1490
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,000
you know it becomes something that's

1491
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,040
biologically very dynamic

1492
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,440
and so the idea of the medium of

1493
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,760
exchange is a fascinating one here

1494
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,800
so i just wanted to fuss with that a

1495
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,240
little bit and then so if you look at it

1496
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,280
that way

1497
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,319
then the meaning

1498
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,119
so this is zimbabwe local community

1499
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:31,680
meaning

1500
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,200
and then there's united states local

1501
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,839
community meeting and they're different

1502
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,760
because the community is what generates

1503
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,200
the value not

1504
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,880
the money this is a piece of paper has

1505
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,960
exactly the same value as a us

1506
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,480
dollar but it's the symbol of a system

1507
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,559
and the system is the community in the

1508
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,920
communities where the value comes from

1509
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,760
not from the piece of paper so

1510
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,640
that's the intrinsic uncovering one of

1511
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,599
the things that i've been

1512
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,880
fussing with just to share on this

1513
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,000
point is so the past people have been

1514
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,599
doing money and maybe they're not so

1515
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,440
stupid maybe they've been doing clubs

1516
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,200
maybe this is a money club right

1517
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,520
um and so one of the challenges is well

1518
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,760
now maybe we need a redistribution idea

1519
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,520
among the clubs and i think one of the

1520
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,160
things that's

1521
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,520
really appealing about the way you're

1522
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,240
describing things is the intrinsic

1523
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,800
transparency

1524
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,280
that comes with the exponential increase

1525
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
in interaction volumes

1526
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,520
so it's impossible to su press

1527
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,040
transparency among so many interactions

1528
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,119
is very similar to after 2008 financial

1529
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:37,599
break

1530
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,880
where there were calls to get rid of the

1531
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,480
rating agencies because that was one

1532
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,160
stop shop for conflicts of interest you

1533
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,280
pay them more money you get a better

1534
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,160
rating

1535
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,760
and they said instead let's get rid of

1536
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:45,930
the

1537
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,359
[Music]

1538
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,200
trading agencies and let's use the

1539
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
spreads in credit default swap markets

1540
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,240
because it tells you the same

1541
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,920
information will the company pay its

1542
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,200
debts as they become to that's what the

1543
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,400
rating agencies tell you

1544
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,520
and that's what the spreads and credit

1545
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,359
default swap markets tell you but the

1546
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,800
difference is in this in the credit to

1547
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,839
falsehood markets

1548
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,240
those are set by thousands of

1549
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,400
interactions so you can't game them

1550
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,520
right so that's what distributed

1551
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,040
governance looks like and that's what

1552
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
intrinsically you're it feels like

1553
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,040
you're building that from the bottom up

1554
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,280
but not just vis-a-vis financial

1555
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,800
instruments but vis-a-vis anything

1556
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,680
that community as the source of trust

1557
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,880
and knowledge

1558
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,040
and then the i call it the community

1559
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,680
trust community information boomerang

1560
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,720
because then when you want to

1561
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,440
authenticate or audit you go back to the

1562
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,640
community because that's the ultimate

1563
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,839
source of trust because that's where it

1564
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,119
came from the first place because it

1565
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,400
didn't come from the data passing

1566
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,040
through it

1567
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,680
it came from the fact of the meaning in

1568
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,960
the community

1569
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,839
drenching and enriching the information

1570
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,440
as it goes through right so i really

1571
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
love the way you're talking i just want

1572
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,400
to make a

1573
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,440
few comments on it but that abstraction

1574
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,400
of money

1575
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,680
is kind of an interesting thing that you

1576
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,599
get to levels of abstraction

1577
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,359
where abstraction itself becomes a form

1578
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,280
of violence

1579
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,760
because it's because it reduces the

1580
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,520
granularity with which a system

1581
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,480
sees the individual and so just last

1582
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,960
point

1583
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,720
kandinsky of the folks on this phone

1584
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,079
have heard this already but kandinsky

1585
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
made it

1586
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,119
the painter said once that violence

1587
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,599
societies yield abstract art

1588
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,720
and one of the things i always wondered

1589
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,799
is that reversal is abstraction itself

1590
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:19,440
violence

1591
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
and to me it feels like getting to a

1592
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,880
certain scale

1593
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,480
it feels like violence try dealing with

1594
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,400
verizon the other day i

1595
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,760
was so frustrated i was wanted to slam

1596
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,520
my phone down on the receiver down but i

1597
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,799
only had a cell phone i don't have an

1598
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,160
old style phone so i couldn't slam it

1599
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,799
down

1600
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:40,000
with drama anyway

1601
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,960
so these are you've raised a whole

1602
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,720
series of really interesting and

1603
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,839
important

1604
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,200
points so

1605
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,319
first what is money

1606
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,760
you know if we're going to if we're

1607
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,680
going to design new systems including

1608
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,359
new economic systems new financial

1609
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,520
systems new monetary systems

1610
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,839
what is what is money what is what is

1611
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,760
what is what is its function

1612
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,760
in a in a club or in a society right

1613
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,359
well um already in what i call native

1614
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,160
systems money is a voting tool if if i

1615
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,680
have a billion dollars

1616
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,160
i get to vote for any number of things

1617
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,680
that i want i can make

1618
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,720
i can make whole organizations do

1619
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,920
fulfill my you know desires because i

1620
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,640
have

1621
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,280
i have enormous voting power now

1622
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,119
obviously that voting power is not

1623
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:33,920
democratic

1624
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,079
it's not transparent it's you know it's

1625
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,920
really a dysfunctional

1626
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,680
uh inflow of information uh and

1627
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,920
the and quite obviously if we're going

1628
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,040
to design new systems we would want to

1629
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,799
it's fine that money is used as an

1630
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,200
information tool

1631
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,920
but that information tool should be

1632
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,599
completely transparent

1633
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,400
fairly distributed uh you know it should

1634
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,359
actually function

1635
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,720
as a way for all of us to share

1636
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,839
our desires our fears our our

1637
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,520
our you know our viewpoints our

1638
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,319
our preferences to the community you

1639
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,480
know it's

1640
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,880
redesigned money that serves an

1641
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,960
informational purpose and is inter

1642
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,240
and is transparent and is you know

1643
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,960
deeply

1644
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,599
democratic in its function that's a you

1645
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,040
that that would be a useful way to

1646
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,720
communicate you know

1647
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,280
uh so so that's part of the task is to

1648
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,200
how do we do that how do we design

1649
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,720
a system that functions like how do we

1650
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,400
design an economic system that functions

1651
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,040
that way

1652
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,920
where money is no longer even viewed as

1653
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,680
money in the normal

1654
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,760
way that economics is as a matter of

1655
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,280
fact that economics the like the

1656
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,319
economic profession

1657
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,160
say for a club is not even resembles

1658
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,720
economics because suddenly we're not

1659
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,160
talking about economics we're talking

1660
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,000
about cognition

1661
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,160
we're talking about a societal cog this

1662
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,079
is all about

1663
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,359
decision making under uncertainty

1664
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,160
in reference to some fitness you know

1665
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,040
vitality

1666
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,839
score of like how do this is cognition

1667
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:10,480
how do we

1668
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,599
how do we it's no longer economics

1669
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,799
now it's a now it's a new field called

1670
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,720
cognition that happens to use a voting

1671
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,480
tool called that we might call money

1672
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,640
a couple things on that so um you know a

1673
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,040
club can't redesign the same national

1674
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,040
currency can't redesign the dollar or

1675
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,160
anything like that so but it can create

1676
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,040
a currency

1677
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
for its own use within its own within

1678
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,359
its own

1679
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,480
milieu that functions exactly the way

1680
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,920
that i'm describing that that is

1681
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,200
transparent that is

1682
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,040
you know does all the things that we've

1683
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,640
just been describing

1684
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,880
so i take a shot at that in my design of

1685
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,760
the lead

1686
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,319
framework and um if we get to it

1687
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,640
i'll try to you know show you how kind

1688
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,319
of conceptually how that works well it's

1689
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:00,799
just

1690
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,040
just a quick follow-up that's one of the

1691
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,040
elements of sovereignty right is the

1692
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,240
tax and the money issuance the m1

1693
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,280
supply you can't use a starbucks card

1694
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,200
everywhere because that would intrude on

1695
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,040
the sovereign supply of money on the

1696
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,160
fiat

1697
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,799
and so the exertion of authority into

1698
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,640
every every interaction

1699
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,680
is has three parties in it because the

1700
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,799
trading medium is a declaration by the

1701
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:27,760
sovereign

1702
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
that they are there to help but it's

1703
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:30,880
like

1704
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,000
um von munchausen by proxy syndrome

1705
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,240
right they they keep people weak in

1706
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,680
their interactions in order

1707
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,799
for themselves to be strong

1708
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,680
right very interesting just because

1709
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,799
there's a bunch of questions the chat

1710
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,000
and a lot of raised hands so i want to

1711
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,520
get to everyone in order

1712
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,440
so um dave and then i'm going to ask a

1713
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,200
question in the chat and then blue and

1714
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,280
stephen

1715
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,160
yeah it's not self-evident what the

1716
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,280
relations

1717
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,400
of property intellectual property

1718
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,480
occupation competence uh

1719
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,079
in the u.s there seems to be a um

1720
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,119
an insistence that there that the

1721
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,960
the traditional money relationship

1722
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,839
structures everything else your

1723
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:18,640
competence

1724
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,799
is determined by who writes your page

1725
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,960
your credibility is determined by that

1726
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,240
um it isn't that way every place

1727
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,280
in mexico um the right

1728
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,839
to professional association and

1729
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,920
voluntary association is written into

1730
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,200
the constitution

1731
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,599
in the philippines the government is

1732
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,160
constitutionally obligated not just to

1733
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,119
tolerate

1734
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,559
but to actively promote professional

1735
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,000
associations and voluntary associations

1736
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,640
uh and reading some of the things and by

1737
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,160
no means all the things that robert

1738
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,040
david steele

1739
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,319
says denmark apparently is

1740
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,680
doing a fabulous job of managing the

1741
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,359
knowledge economy

1742
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,640
and uh moving more and more all the time

1743
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,520
to

1744
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,680
open source everything except maybe

1745
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,040
initiation of government force

1746
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,440
out and out violence to preserve

1747
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,640
buildings and children and things like

1748
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,879
that

1749
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,079
thanks for the comment sure yeah you

1750
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:26,799
looked at

1751
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,079
it steel's uh proposals for

1752
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,440
um setting up a very much more

1753
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,480
transparent way of exchanging knowledge

1754
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,760
and vetting competence

1755
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,880
no i'm not i'm not familiar let's um

1756
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,839
share that it sounds interesting though

1757
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:46,720
yeah

1758
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,640
cool and and part of this prelude in the

1759
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,160
research and development phase is

1760
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,119
certainly to

1761
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,760
take stock of various proposals that

1762
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,160
address

1763
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,079
different aspects related to

1764
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,839
transparency accountability

1765
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,640
information propagation value exchange

1766
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,000
crypto economics

1767
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
nfts all these things are going to be

1768
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,520
woven together in a new

1769
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,760
tapestry that hopefully is our parachute

1770
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,200
slash trampoline

1771
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,160
so yvonne

1772
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,039
yvonne asks a question in the chat he

1773
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,119
says hello thanks john for the second

1774
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:17,839
stream

1775
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,720
sixth stream it is excellent my question

1776
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,039
is

1777
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,559
does the club model imply a governance

1778
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,799
where two or more clubs come into

1779
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,559
confrontation in their ways of

1780
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,440
acting so early stage club development

1781
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,119
or late stage let's just say two clubs

1782
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,480
don't just believe different things they

1783
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,359
don't just infer

1784
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,000
differently but they act differently

1785
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,799
what do we do

1786
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,000
sure okay so um so

1787
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,599
the in the r d program maybe the first

1788
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,559
task will just be to work out how

1789
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:49,760
cognition

1790
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,920
societal cognition can happen in a club

1791
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,960
setting you know like well

1792
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,319
and then all the different systems that

1793
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,480
support them

1794
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,960
but very quickly you know once progress

1795
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,480
is being made towards that end

1796
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,160
the next big question is how do clubs

1797
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,880
cognate

1798
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,319
how how do they communicate

1799
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,640
so just as there would be just as there

1800
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,039
would be systems and technologies and

1801
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:13,920
frameworks

1802
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,200
that allow individuals in a club to

1803
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,119
communicate and cognate together and

1804
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,400
make decisions together

1805
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,920
whether they're economic decisions or

1806
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,440
whether they're governance decisions or

1807
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,240
whatever kind of

1808
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,400
legal decisions whatever that is there

1809
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,359
would be a similar

1810
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,559
kind of overlay to the to the

1811
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,680
between club setting right so that those

1812
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,079
those

1813
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,760
maybe it would be similar technologies

1814
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,440
maybe they would be adapted a little bit

1815
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,640
for the club to club

1816
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,920
interactions but the same kind of

1817
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,480
concept

1818
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,760
holds is that uh clubs

1819
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,559
the community of clubs is a cognitive

1820
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:49,520
community is a

1821
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,319
you know is a is an organism a cognitive

1822
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,119
organism

1823
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,839
so how does it make decisions and view

1824
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,480
the world

1825
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,520
and uh and act

1826
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,640
now it might be that let's say that down

1827
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,000
the road there are

1828
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,240
hundreds of clubs or thousands of clubs

1829
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,359
and one club

1830
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,720
says you know what we

1831
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,039
really like this slavery idea that's

1832
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,559
gonna work really well for us and you

1833
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,359
know we're gonna

1834
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,160
we're gonna go off on this tension or

1835
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,960
you know some

1836
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,240
some say destructive tangent um

1837
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,280
well you know i mean how do you how does

1838
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,400
a healthy

1839
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,440
family or a healthy group of friends

1840
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,599
deal with issues like this you know how

1841
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,720
do organisms deal with issues like this

1842
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,960
you can put pressure in various ways on

1843
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,599
an organism that is being anti-social

1844
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,720
you know or an individual in your family

1845
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,799
a brother that's being anti-violent or

1846
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,720
anti-social there's various ways you can

1847
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,960
try to pressure them maybe to

1848
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,079
behave more socially appropriately or

1849
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,039
something

1850
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,200
uh so that so that would be part of the

1851
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,520
the conceptualizing and the design of

1852
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,359
these frameworks is how do you deal with

1853
01:04:59,359 --> 01:04:59,599
the

1854
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,760
how do you deal with problems when when

1855
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,920
some club is not is you know misbehaving

1856
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,520
or some individual and a club is

1857
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,200
misbehaving there ought to be

1858
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,240
that ought to be well thought out so you

1859
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,119
have a procedure that you follow when

1860
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,640
things like that happen right

1861
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,240
but but just off the top of my head

1862
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,760
there would be many things you might do

1863
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,559
say a club was you know somehow turned

1864
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,480
rogue like a cancer

1865
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,200
in this community well you can you can

1866
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,119
decide not to trade with it you can all

1867
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,480
the other clubs can say you know what

1868
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,839
this is not

1869
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,160
this is not part of our larger community

1870
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,000
this isn't right this doesn't work

1871
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,280
and we're gonna exile you you know

1872
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,520
i mean various things you might do but

1873
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,440
all of these have to be given thought of

1874
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,039
how do you deal with the situations that

1875
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,000
arise

1876
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,960
and uh you know there there could well

1877
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,680
be

1878
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,720
reasonable ways that the communication

1879
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,119
through you know through other means

1880
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,400
that you could

1881
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,839
start to harmonize the whole if it's

1882
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,880
in a state of disharmony thanks i mean

1883
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,440
obviously

1884
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,839
obviously the human body does that right

1885
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,039
i mean the human

1886
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,720
there's trillions of cells in the human

1887
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,559
body and somehow

1888
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,359
they basically all work together and on

1889
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,880
a rare occasion

1890
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,000
some cells decide not to the the

1891
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,400
and we might call that a cancer so you

1892
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,880
know that cancers can happen

1893
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
and how do you then put you know the

1894
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,400
question becomes how do you prevent

1895
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,000
cancer from happening

1896
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,400
and obviously what i would say obviously

1897
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,520
one way is

1898
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,440
keep the organism healthy you know keep

1899
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,520
it keep it all

1900
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,640
healthy and

1901
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,240
that helps um keep communications open

1902
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,520
you know that that helps and then if

1903
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,000
cancer still arises then you know how do

1904
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,760
you then we have to have a way to deal

1905
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,440
with it

1906
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,480
thanks john so blue and then stephen

1907
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,359
so john i just want to say thanks i've

1908
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,119
really enjoyed all of your streams

1909
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,160
thus far and this is like a huge problem

1910
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,960
that um you've attempted to tackle here

1911
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,720
and so i don't want to like

1912
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,680
um approach it in in a way like it seems

1913
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,039
like i'm a naysayer or like i'm

1914
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,480
boohooing i just

1915
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,119
there's some extra components here that

1916
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:15,680
i think

1917
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,200
um you know maybe you have thought about

1918
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,200
or have approached it in a very delicate

1919
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,559
way so the concentration of wealth and

1920
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,680
power power i i feel

1921
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,039
in this country and this is definitely

1922
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,280
personal opinion or maybe in the world

1923
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,920
it is it like stems from some kind of

1924
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,599
spiritual bankruptcy

1925
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,079
right and and we've always had authority

1926
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,359
and like you talked about authority and

1927
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,640
societal cognition

1928
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,640
in the last paper and you talked about

1929
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,400
you know how authority comes from either

1930
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,839
voluntary deference

1931
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,200
or coercion right and previously

1932
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,039
from you know the beginning of written

1933
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,039
record until now

1934
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,280
and maybe even still now that voluntary

1935
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,559
indeference and coercion both can come

1936
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:00,960
from

1937
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,119
religion and religious groups and we've

1938
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,480
seen the god gene

1939
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,920
right and so i know that like you've

1940
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,160
kind of sidestepped and produced a very

1941
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,960
agnostic

1942
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,039
platform and and i mean i know that you

1943
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,240
also did talk about like the

1944
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,280
interconnectedness

1945
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,238
of all things and kind of um bringing

1946
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:17,198
that forward in

1947
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,080
an education way and not a religious way

1948
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,719
and i

1949
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,560
i definitely appreciate that but do you

1950
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,158
think that they're

1951
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,319
it's possible that we're hardwired you

1952
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,399
know we have this god gene right like

1953
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,560
that we're hardwired to need

1954
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,439
something beyond and that that if we

1955
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:34,799
have that something beyond

1956
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,040
maybe the concentration of wealth and

1957
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,479
power if we all gave

1958
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,799
you know if we all did tithing 10 of all

1959
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:41,679
of our salary

1960
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,198
i mean i think that that would equal out

1961
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,799
the world just that

1962
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,839
right so so i mean is it possible that

1963
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:48,719
religion is

1964
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,560
absent and maybe plays the more central

1965
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,759
role in

1966
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:57,040
society than you've allowed for here

1967
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,120
yeah i've not talked about religion much

1968
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:03,839
at all in

1969
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,439
any of the papers nor in the series

1970
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,679
these discussions and i don't i don't

1971
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,198
really want to

1972
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,719
um i i think this

1973
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,759
program can go and continue it can move

1974
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:18,319
forward

1975
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,000
and reach its aims fine without

1976
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,640
without focusing on the topic of

1977
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,319
religion

1978
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,560
now

1979
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,479
you know because people people belong to

1980
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,880
all kinds of organizations including

1981
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,640
religious organizations they

1982
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,640
people get meaning from all kinds of

1983
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,000
organizations

1984
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,600
and associations so good you know fine

1985
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,319
that's

1986
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,359
fine the the topic here

1987
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,040
is how does a community

1988
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,960
cognate how does it make decisions how

1989
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,480
can we create

1990
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,000
systems that favor beneficial and

1991
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,520
healthy cognition

1992
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,560
right so those two things can exist

1993
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,920
at the same time you know people can

1994
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,679
belong to religions and

1995
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,040
um and and participate in healthier

1996
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,840
systems

1997
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,199
at the same time um as far as meaning

1998
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,320
goes uh

1999
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,560
you know people find some people find

2000
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,320
meaning in religion

2001
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,360
um but in the uh

2002
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,480
i think it's useful for this project to

2003
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,520
also

2004
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,640
um consider the the some of the ideas

2005
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,600
that i had in my first paper world view

2006
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,080
because those ideas of like how we are

2007
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,679
all interconnected how we

2008
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,360
are like trans really in in some sense

2009
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,239
transcendent ideas that that have

2010
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,360
scientific

2011
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,800
you know a rationale

2012
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,159
behind them right um

2013
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,199
that's useful to consider those points

2014
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,320
in the worldview

2015
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,360
paper because that at least in my

2016
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,280
in my thinking those concepts are

2017
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,480
are central to even coming up with

2018
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,679
the the uh concept of purpose

2019
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,600
so what is the if we're if we're

2020
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
together in a society

2021
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
what are we doing what is our purpose

2022
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,040
like if we don't have a purpose why are

2023
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,000
we even

2024
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,360
associating with each other you know

2025
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
just randomly or like

2026
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,880
just to take advantage of each other

2027
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,520
like why are we even in a

2028
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,440
community together you know like whether

2029
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,120
it's a large community or a small

2030
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,000
community

2031
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,320
so i'm suggesting in the particularly in

2032
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,679
the first paper that

2033
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,960
that if we come together with a purpose

2034
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,360
you know and that purpose is to thrive

2035
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,400
now and in the future

2036
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,880
then we can do something about that we

2037
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,239
can you know we can create

2038
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,480
systems that allow us to fulfill that

2039
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,360
purpose

2040
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,199
that are true that are true to purpose

2041
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,880
the technology in a sense that's

2042
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,480
that functions the way it's supposed to

2043
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,159
function um

2044
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,600
and the the concept of purpose comes

2045
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,679
from this larger world view of who

2046
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,640
what is a human what is an individual

2047
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:02,960
how

2048
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,679
how are we all related to all of life um

2049
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,320
you know that's

2050
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,239
at least my mind that's kind of where

2051
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,920
where the idea of purpose comes from

2052
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,360
like you know that we're

2053
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,280
actually together as a society we're an

2054
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,760
organism and an organism is connected to

2055
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,480
all

2056
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,080
other organisms and all of life is

2057
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,360
connected all the way up to the

2058
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,480
biosphere

2059
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,120
and our purpose and include all of that

2060
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,760
so

2061
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,600
you could call that a trans you know a

2062
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,360
transcendent

2063
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,320
perspective perhaps and that might be

2064
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,320
i'm i'm hoping that might be meaningful

2065
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:32,800
to

2066
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,320
folks who might want to be involved in

2067
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,120
this kind of project

2068
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,199
because uh you know if it is there's

2069
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,640
scientific reasons

2070
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,159
for all of that you know there's a

2071
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,159
rationale for all of that that

2072
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,520
we can explore all of that

2073
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,239
scientifically and otherwise you know

2074
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,520
uh so so yes people

2075
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,199
belong to religions and they can

2076
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,880
continue to belong to religions and

2077
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,920
and and from my perspective that

2078
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,800
that you know those organizations will

2079
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,920
will

2080
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,600
continue to exist as long as they're

2081
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,840
useful just like any organization just

2082
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
like any association it should continue

2083
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,159
to

2084
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,199
exist as long as it's useful it's not

2085
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,520
going to happen in the club setting

2086
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,880
you know some people might be

2087
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,360
religiously oriented that's fine

2088
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,000
and but that's not really the you know

2089
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,360
the the

2090
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,560
the club focus the r d project the

2091
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,800
the design of new systems the engagement

2092
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
of people in a societal cognition

2093
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,600
framework that can all happen whether

2094
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,640
someone is religious

2095
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,840
or not i would say so so just as i said

2096
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,440
did i sidestep it well enough there

2097
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,920
well can i just ask a quick follow-up so

2098
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,080
so

2099
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,840
so definitely in the um societal

2100
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,320
cognition i mean

2101
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,040
i just think that um we have to factor

2102
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,600
in

2103
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,760
the role that religion plays in the

2104
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,840
societal cognition because

2105
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,440
we give our we do voluntary deference

2106
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,640
and coercion through religion and and i

2107
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,480
think that it's something that if people

2108
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,360
ascribe to a religious practice that we

2109
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,159
have to

2110
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,679
allow for that and examine what role

2111
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,679
that will have on societal cognition at

2112
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,280
large like whether they're part of a

2113
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,960
religious organization or not

2114
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,679
or whatever oh sure those those are fine

2115
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:18,640
questions does

2116
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,440
does say you know does religion a in

2117
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,159
some ways

2118
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,280
impact the capacity of these systems to

2119
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,120
function in the way we're thinking they

2120
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,040
could function that's a fair question

2121
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,600
that's a scientific question

2122
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,880
or perhaps examining the the framework

2123
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,960
through the lens of each religion would

2124
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,480
be maybe useful

2125
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,560
and that would be useful also how that

2126
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,080
would be part of the question

2127
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,840
of like you know is there some impact

2128
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,920
that this that religion a is having on

2129
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,800
this system

2130
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,280
and uh if so let's talk about what how

2131
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,560
do how does this group

2132
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,400
see the world how does that how does

2133
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,920
that you know how do

2134
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,600
what's our differences of the way we see

2135
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,520
the world you know those are all

2136
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,800
fine questions and all of those

2137
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,719
questions can be addressed in a kind of

2138
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,040
a scientific manner

2139
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,280
when um when scott mentioned that

2140
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,800
there's the buyer in the cellar but also

2141
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,000
there's like the umbrella

2142
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,159
of the trust in the sovereign in the

2143
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,120
fiat you know

2144
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,760
fiat lux uh is how the book begins in

2145
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,640
some ways

2146
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,040
it's a lot like a marriage partnership

2147
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,719
where there is a third party and

2148
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,640
that third party is the context and

2149
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,239
various religions have different ways to

2150
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,480
talk about that third entity

2151
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,080
but it's so interesting how when we're

2152
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,880
dealing with identity and communication

2153
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,199
and

2154
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,199
trust it is like we need to have a

2155
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,719
higher level scaffold

2156
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,960
now can nature provide that can

2157
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,120
so-called science today or in the future

2158
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,159
provide that

2159
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,719
that's what we're going to discover and

2160
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:41,840
discuss

2161
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,199
so um stephen and then lee and then dave

2162
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,520
yeah this this idea of

2163
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,239
the environment and how we connect in to

2164
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,159
say a shared epistemic niche

2165
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,080
a way of understanding and

2166
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,000
kristen talks about that in some of his

2167
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,640
interviews

2168
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,040
around you know even religion can help

2169
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,159
us have a shared

2170
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,000
i think it's an epistemic framework or

2171
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,520
an epistemic niche for

2172
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,640
how we can align and that

2173
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,840
then ties into you know how do we

2174
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,320
treat hidden states if we're going to

2175
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,920
have active inference so as well as

2176
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,199
cognition

2177
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,880
dynamical system in the brain and body

2178
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,640
you know the niche

2179
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,760
and where we are in the niche becomes a

2180
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,199
big part of that

2181
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,800
and of course what we've seen over the

2182
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,719
last 200 years is

2183
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,960
there's more and more states that are

2184
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,080
being fixed

2185
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,239
in the environment the things that we

2186
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,000
say we know or mechanical

2187
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,280
objects which will take over and get rid

2188
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,679
of

2189
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,520
uncertainty markets will supposedly deal

2190
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,560
with all of that

2191
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,679
all these different um and it leaves

2192
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,840
less of a role for trying to attune to

2193
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,360
hidden states

2194
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,840
beyond so that that may be

2195
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,560
um one of those questions around

2196
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,880
you know money being a classic case of

2197
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,280
that you know how much do we trust

2198
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,239
in the econom economics and that will

2199
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:12,719
solve

2200
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:13,920
you know just vote for the best

2201
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,199
economics and it will deal with

2202
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,480
everything

2203
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,360
um but where is that is that really a

2204
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,280
deontic queue like fristen talks about

2205
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,880
deontic queues are accusing the

2206
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,640
environment like traffic lights

2207
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,239
that we just build all the traffic

2208
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,320
lights and then we just work

2209
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,400
to do what they tell us but that's where

2210
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,560
that violence can come in that i think

2211
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,560
was also mentioned is because

2212
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,199
deontic cues will always win if they're

2213
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,320
very strong

2214
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,360
over active influence in a community

2215
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,400
because active influence in the

2216
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,400
community needs integration it needs

2217
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,120
time to actually listen to the landscape

2218
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,360
and if you can have deontic cues that

2219
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,880
say well

2220
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,920
just you know that's not needed you kill

2221
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,239
a lot of that so in some way

2222
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,360
ways that might be relevant here is

2223
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,320
showing the benefit of epistemic niches

2224
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,440
yeah

2225
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,960
in some ways these conversations are

2226
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,560
related to

2227
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,800
some of the points that blue is picking

2228
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,679
up on

2229
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,199
so so you know um

2230
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,640
if you try to to talk a little bit about

2231
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,360
about this so religion is a part of

2232
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,239
culture

2233
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,840
you know you can think of that as

2234
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,000
religious groups as a different cultural

2235
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,360
groups kind of social cultural groups

2236
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,480
right

2237
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,159
um you know culture is really useful

2238
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,960
uh no cultural norms are really useful

2239
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,480
can be useful they can

2240
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,360
draw our attention the things that in

2241
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,960
the world that are most important and

2242
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,400
help us to avoid danger

2243
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,600
and you know healthy culture is

2244
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,239
is a part of cognition it's a way to

2245
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,600
offload

2246
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,239
my cognitive burden onto the you know

2247
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,120
the the

2248
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,840
history of this culture that has learned

2249
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
as it has gone through life what works

2250
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,440
and what doesn't work you know

2251
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,640
so um so

2252
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,600
[Music]

2253
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,360
so all you know it is good that

2254
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,159
that say we had a large club with

2255
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:12,800
multiple

2256
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,520
multiple subsets of cultural subsets in

2257
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,239
it

2258
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:20,159
the the the again the purpose of the

2259
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:20,640
club

2260
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,840
is societal cognition right and we we

2261
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,000
should have ways to measure

2262
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,080
if that's functional or dysfunctional

2263
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,040
both in

2264
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,800
are we achieving a quality of high

2265
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,480
quality of life are we

2266
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,960
you know are we are we is our

2267
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,719
uncertainty about the future high

2268
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,640
or low or you know how are we doing

2269
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,960
so so part of that is is engaging

2270
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,080
with cultural groups of subsets you know

2271
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,280
within a within a

2272
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,600
club or within a community right the

2273
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,560
idea of

2274
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,000
all of this what you know like what is

2275
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,760
the idea of cognition well

2276
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,120
cognition requires communication

2277
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,000
there's no that cells in the brain don't

2278
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,560
function

2279
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,199
if there's not communication that's

2280
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,960
going back and forth rich

2281
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,360
rich communication right so we can

2282
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,239
decide

2283
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,960
as a as a as a group you know we can we

2284
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,280
can

2285
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,679
we can we can study different kind of

2286
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,080
designs for systems we can measure

2287
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,880
their success we can you know we can we

2288
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,600
can apply

2289
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,440
a kind of a scientific method to come up

2290
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,840
with good ways to ensure that we're

2291
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,199
we can all thrive but part of that is

2292
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,639
also uh allowing for

2293
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,360
and providing for and facilitating the

2294
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,800
communication between

2295
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,840
this group associations that are subsets

2296
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,920
of any club or any society right i mean

2297
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,400
the

2298
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,760
idea has to be communication and in in a

2299
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,880
cooperative

2300
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,199
sense right or else there's no cognition

2301
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,320
to begin with you know then you just

2302
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,360
have rules

2303
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,840
and it's who god knows who made those

2304
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,520
rules in the first place you know

2305
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,280
so we're just all we're doing is like

2306
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,360
just just look at how

2307
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,800
cognition works and let's be honest

2308
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,400
about it let's be transparent about it

2309
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,360
let's you know let's just peel it peel

2310
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,560
back the

2311
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,960
covers and see how social cognition

2312
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,639
works and see how cognition works

2313
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,560
in biology and learn what we can learn

2314
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,760
from it and and

2315
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,960
uh let's bring the richness of that out

2316
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,840
and make it all transparent and fair

2317
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,400
so that allows for subgroups to have

2318
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,239
cultural differences that a lot

2319
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,880
that's important because cultural you

2320
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,280
know

2321
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,880
cultural subgroups will have a different

2322
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
perspective on

2323
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,120
how to do things or what's important or

2324
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,199
where we should focus our attention you

2325
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:39,760
know that's

2326
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,040
all good right as long as as long as

2327
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,719
it's set up such that we're all

2328
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,239
able to openly communicate

2329
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,080
and tell our story and tell our

2330
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,679
narrative whether that's as an

2331
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,199
individual or whether that's as a

2332
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,639
cultural subgroup you know there's a

2333
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,320
narrative to express to

2334
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,480
there's concerns there's desires there's

2335
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,320
needs you know again humans are very

2336
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
complex organisms we have very complex

2337
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,199
needs

2338
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,960
and all of those you know all the core

2339
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
needs need to be fulfilled in whatever

2340
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,440
healthy society we build

2341
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,679
the need for association the need for

2342
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,199
love the need for

2343
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,040
helping each other like we you know we

2344
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,040
want to help each other

2345
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,400
we have to address all of that and it

2346
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,480
just has to be open and transparent and

2347
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,080
openly discussed about what we're doing

2348
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,320
and how this works and how people

2349
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,480
you know how how these tools and

2350
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,760
approaches facilitate

2351
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,719
cooperation and cognition or hinder it

2352
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,600
you know

2353
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,520
that's the experiment thanks john

2354
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,760
lee and then anyone else with a question

2355
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,080
uh yeah i think this is a a related

2356
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,159
question um i'm just going to read out

2357
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,840
just one thing from your paper actually

2358
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,440
because um

2359
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,560
so you in this paragraph you uh

2360
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,760
you say um

2361
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,840
in a second-order approach to active

2362
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,800
imprint um

2363
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,120
if a society understands itself as a

2364
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,639
cognitive organism

2365
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,159
uh if it understands its cognitive

2366
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,080
process as reducing uncertainty for the

2367
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,520
purpose of achieving and sustainably

2368
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,000
maintaining

2369
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,040
vitality and understand its social

2370
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,960
systems as a cognitive architecture

2371
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,320
then given those beliefs what kind of

2372
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
societal systems might

2373
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,679
it develop and employ um so that got me

2374
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,280
thinking

2375
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,320
is that are those beliefs

2376
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,480
prerequisite then for everybody in the

2377
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,760
club does it need to be that level of

2378
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,360
shared understanding or can it be just

2379
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,560
held within a

2380
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,639
kind of a subsystem you know is it is

2381
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,080
that something that perhaps the

2382
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,360
the scientists who are doing the

2383
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,120
simulation etc right right

2384
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,159
that's a good question now um you i

2385
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,280
think we should uh

2386
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,080
allow that if this r d program were to

2387
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,920
go forward that you know it might start

2388
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,239
small and focused and there might be a

2389
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,400
focused group involved of those

2390
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,000
people who are interested in this kind

2391
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,320
of thing right and if it started to

2392
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,239
work and you know it proved to be

2393
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,159
beneficial to communities then it might

2394
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,080
grow and other people would get involved

2395
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,280
and

2396
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,040
so we can think of this whole thing as

2397
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,880
progression i think that's fair that's

2398
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,840
the way it would

2399
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,840
naturally play out and uh

2400
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,440
you know if the scientific community is

2401
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,880
involved in this and if the scientific

2402
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,960
community is involved in creating

2403
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,960
and helping to you know co-designing new

2404
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,239
systems well then there's going to

2405
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:17,520
certainly be

2406
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,560
a focus on the scientific viewpoint

2407
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,040
in order to do that communities

2408
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,560
obviously would have their input into

2409
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,360
the r d

2410
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,440
program and you know it would between

2411
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,199
the two between the two

2412
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,760
it would move forward but i would guess

2413
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,960
though

2414
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,920
that early participants and early

2415
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,800
efforts

2416
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,840
would be uh focused you know would more

2417
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,920
or less align with what i have in the

2418
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,199
worldview paper

2419
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,719
or else they why would they be

2420
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,560
interested in participating

2421
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,840
in the first place you know like they

2422
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,239
would maybe only be interested because

2423
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,719
they'll they can see some alignment with

2424
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,400
the goals of the program and

2425
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,560
the way the program is oriented and

2426
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,639
what it's trying to achieve right so

2427
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:01,679
quite likely the

2428
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,440
early participants in this whole thing

2429
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,960
whether they're scientists or community

2430
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,639
members might be kind of more or less

2431
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:07,679
aligned with

2432
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,400
ideas in the world of your paper and and

2433
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,520
especially the purpose

2434
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,520
of you know the purpose of a club or the

2435
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,000
purpose of societal cognition

2436
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,440
now suppose down the road you know 20

2437
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,719
years from now i live in los angeles and

2438
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,320
they're you know like i don't i don't

2439
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,600
care at all about

2440
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,800
any of that stuff i just want to live my

2441
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,199
life

2442
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,520
and you know make sure my i have a roof

2443
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,880
over my head and stuff

2444
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,719
but this club is up and going and is

2445
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,400
doing well and they're all there

2446
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,800
you know they're actually doing well my

2447
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,520
neighbor is

2448
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,760
a part of it and his life is improved in

2449
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,880
some way

2450
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,639
so like i don't really i don't really

2451
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,159
you know like i don't i don't care about

2452
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:46,880
any of the

2453
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,600
purpose stuff too much but i like what's

2454
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,360
happening you know like they got a

2455
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,199
nice scene going on there that's

2456
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,040
beneficial so i'm gonna join anyway you

2457
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,760
know

2458
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,320
and it's so to a degree the the culture

2459
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,080
of it would change it would evolve

2460
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,840
but hopefully that would be it would

2461
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,199
start with a certain

2462
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:06,239
kind of it would start in a healthy

2463
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,320
functional way you know aligned with the

2464
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,239
purpose of the whole project

2465
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,440
and then it would evolve the way it

2466
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,360
evolves you know i would

2467
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,360
i would guess that if it's beneficial

2468
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,600
those beneficial ideas would continue to

2469
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,719
be the

2470
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,480
you know at its core somehow but how it

2471
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,159
exactly it evolves you know as as

2472
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,239
decades goes on and as you know as

2473
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:29,679
is 100 years from now it's maybe maybe

2474
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,920
you know we if this exists 100 years

2475
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,679
from now and if it's spread widely maybe

2476
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:34,159
we're

2477
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,040
using very different language to talk

2478
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,920
about it and

2479
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,360
we see it differently perhaps

2480
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,040
thanks john um now as the author

2481
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,199
it is up to you would you like to shift

2482
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,400
the second slide

2483
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,920
for today these are awesome

2484
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,400
questions thanks everyone in the chat

2485
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,120
and for

2486
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,480
participating because it's it's a

2487
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,560
conversation and john's

2488
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,400
uh initial inroads are tripartite

2489
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,800
and very provocative and we're seeing

2490
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,120
that play out and so it's a great

2491
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,480
beginning to a discussion even though

2492
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,639
it's our dot 2 video so john where would

2493
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,360
you like to take it for the last second

2494
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,840
uh yeah obviously there's a lot of ideas

2495
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,600
in this whole series there's just a ton

2496
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,400
of ideas

2497
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,400
uh both both uh superficial and deep

2498
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,960
and if this goes forward it's gonna take

2499
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,600
a

2500
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,000
lot of discussion and it's gonna take a

2501
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,600
lot of people involved to bring

2502
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,880
different perspectives to

2503
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,199
kind of make bring this whole concept to

2504
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,960
fruition right so

2505
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,719
we're just scratching the surface that's

2506
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,480
all we're doing we're just

2507
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,080
putting out some of the big ideas and

2508
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,000
then you know there's a ton of work that

2509
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,719
has to happen to make this real

2510
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,280
so uh can you go to uh four

2511
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:53,199
number four group four slides maybe uh

2512
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,800
um maybe uh slide

2513
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,400
seven six if uh seven integrated

2514
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,560
components on slide six

2515
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,400
six yeah yeah seven integrated

2516
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,159
components yeah awesome okay so

2517
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,560
uh maybe in the last little remaining

2518
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,239
time we'll just touch on this

2519
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,320
lita framework the simulation model that

2520
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,440
i put out

2521
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,040
it's really the the idea of the leader

2522
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,600
is

2523
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,000
more than just an economic system it is

2524
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,960
actually

2525
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,320
the idea of it that is put out in the

2526
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,679
in uh in my book economic direct

2527
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:28,560
democracy

2528
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,760
um talks about the whole picture the

2529
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,199
larger picture but there

2530
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,040
there's as you can see from the slide

2531
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,280
there's seven components to that

2532
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,239
and and they really touch on all six

2533
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:41,760
overarching systems

2534
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,440
that i talk about in the series so

2535
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,199
economic governance legal

2536
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,280
analytical education and health it's all

2537
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,639
in there somewhere

2538
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,880
so the idea of the leader that's local

2539
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,600
economic direct democracy association

2540
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,239
the idea of the leader is an integrated

2541
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:59,760
framework of cognitive systems

2542
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,600
the simulation really focuses more just

2543
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,440
on the economic aspect because that was

2544
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,440
the eat really was just the easiest

2545
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:09,120
piece to pick up first um

2546
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,239
and uh the the the uh in particular it

2547
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,600
focuses on the

2548
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,280
what i call the token exchange system

2549
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,679
which is the first three in the list

2550
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,800
so there's a token is a is a local

2551
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,840
digital currency

2552
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,159
so um that the community creates and

2553
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,679
uses

2554
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,679
uh there's the token monetary system

2555
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,520
there's what i call the crowd-based

2556
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,199
financial system

2557
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,840
uh and there's a market system local

2558
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,320
markets people sell you know creating

2559
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,840
goods and sell them in local markets

2560
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,440
they also obviously sell

2561
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,480
distantly to people who are uh

2562
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,480
either in the local area but not a part

2563
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,000
of the club but also

2564
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,679
far distant that are not a part of the

2565
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,120
club

2566
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:52,000
so those uh first three things

2567
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,400
constitute the token exchange system

2568
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,159
and we'll just maybe talk a little bit

2569
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,159
about the simulation and some of the

2570
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,199
results and

2571
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:03,920
how that works um

2572
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,320
maybe slide eight yeah yep

2573
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,360
so in the simulation there's five

2574
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,239
aggregate agents uh there's

2575
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,280
organizations

2576
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,360
persons the cloud-based financial system

2577
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,920
local government and then the rest of

2578
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,040
the world which i call

2579
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,760
rest of counties the the data for the

2580
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,960
simulation

2581
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,480
the initial data was from the u.s census

2582
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,080
for eugene oregon

2583
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,560
relatively small community a small

2584
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,960
county population 100 000 or something

2585
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,360
like that

2586
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,600
and i used starting income values from

2587
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,880
the census data for

2588
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,600
eugene county from 2014 or something

2589
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,880
like that

2590
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
um this paper was published i believe in

2591
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,800
2014 so i probably used a little earlier

2592
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,360
data

2593
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,480
to get things rolling okay so

2594
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,360
the the simulation just it really

2595
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,719
illustrates

2596
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,199
it doesn't it doesn't predict how the

2597
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,320
system would work it just

2598
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,480
illustrates my thinking about how a

2599
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,080
system could work

2600
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,719
and in particular i wanted to uh i

2601
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:13,520
wanted to

2602
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,639
design a system that would that could

2603
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,480
bootstrap itself up

2604
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,760
without large influx of cash

2605
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,000
or other things from outside so that was

2606
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,440
part of the idea how can a system

2607
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,679
bootstrap itself up

2608
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,040
start with very little and drove from

2609
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,760
there the second was i wanted to create

2610
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,679
an economic system for the

2611
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,239
for the club model where over time

2612
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,280
incomes became

2613
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,239
equal income income and wealth equalized

2614
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:40,719
and

2615
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,080
the the thinking there is that

2616
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,199
money and and and you know the whole

2617
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:50,080
economic and financial aspects of that

2618
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,840
really is part of the cognitive

2619
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,520
community's cognitive system so we're

2620
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,239
using money as a very transparent voting

2621
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:57,280
tool right

2622
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,719
it's like votes information it's

2623
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,080
carrying information about people's

2624
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:02,960
desires and

2625
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,960
fears and everything um

2626
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,560
uh yeah so that's uh

2627
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,760
that's i wanted to show that using a

2628
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,080
stock flow consistent model agent-based

2629
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,320
stock stock flow consistent model

2630
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,520
i just wanted to show that the numbers

2631
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,639
add up correctly

2632
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,960
right like i'm not i'm not i'm not

2633
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,960
creating uh

2634
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,520
dollars out of nowhere there's like a

2635
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,040
there's a logical way

2636
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,320
this plays out and all the numbers add

2637
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:34,719
up there

2638
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:38,000
if there's a flow from one agent

2639
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,080
uh one of these major agents there's a

2640
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,360
you know there's a

2641
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,199
any flow from one agent goes somewhere

2642
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,760
it just doesn't disappear

2643
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,040
uh so uh very briefly the

2644
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,080
uh the lines in blue

2645
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,280
are the flow of tokens and dollars

2646
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,560
so um a community is creating tokens as

2647
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,320
it goes as it grows it creates

2648
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,560
more tokens the the concept is that the

2649
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,639
value of a token would be sort of

2650
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,880
it's sort of equivalent to the value of

2651
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,400
a dollar

2652
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,639
and it's made to be non-inflation

2653
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:11,679
inflationary so

2654
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,960
let's just just say for 2014 it was the

2655
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,480
value of a token is the value of a

2656
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,159
dollar

2657
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,840
purchasing power of a token is that of a

2658
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,600
dollar in 2014.

2659
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,480
and uh um the community would create

2660
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,199
tokens

2661
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,360
a little bit in the first year a little

2662
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,960
bit more of the second years more people

2663
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,040
get engaged there's more use for tokens

2664
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,800
there's more ways to and you know

2665
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,600
use them in in the local markets then

2666
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,880
there would be more tokens

2667
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,080
tokens created and that and the and the

2668
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,400
volume of tokens in the local community

2669
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,440
would grow

2670
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,760
and salaries for those who were members

2671
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,159
of the club salaries would be paid both

2672
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,719
in tokens and in dollars so maybe in the

2673
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,320
first year

2674
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:56,320
you would just get a few tokens and then

2675
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,239
over time your share of tokens

2676
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:03,520
in your wages would go up and the same

2677
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,080
would be true

2678
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,400
even if you're just saying you you

2679
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,080
yourself own a business you know people

2680
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,080
you would sell your if you're a member

2681
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,360
of the community you would sell

2682
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,440
things to other members of the community

2683
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,120
and they would pay you

2684
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,679
in both dollars and tokens amusing

2685
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,840
dollar as the national currency

2686
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,000
so organizations just to look at the

2687
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:22,960
blue lines again

2688
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,760
organizations pay wages to persons the

2689
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,520
persons might be employed or

2690
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,199
unemployed i i also call unemployed not

2691
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:31,760
that there's

2692
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,280
some people who are unemployed or not in

2693
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,000
the workforce that's what an if niwh

2694
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
stands for

2695
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,920
and uh people who members who receive

2696
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,920
dollars and tokens as part of their

2697
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,080
wages as part of their income

2698
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,280
would naturally they would

2699
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,440
have to contribute a certain fraction to

2700
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,000
the crowd-based financial system

2701
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and uh that's the blue line for

2702
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,480
contributions to the cbfs

2703
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,960
and the cn from the cbfs if i'm an

2704
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,960
organization or i'm an individual and i

2705
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,320
have some idea to start a

2706
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,960
business or i need i need loans for my

2707
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,000
business or

2708
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,320
i'm a non-profit and i want grants i can

2709
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,840
go to the cbfs

2710
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,520
and apply for a grant or or a subsidy or

2711
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,880
donation

2712
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,920
and once as a person

2713
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,400
once my once some of my currency is in

2714
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,679
the cdfs

2715
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,520
i more or less get to decide how that

2716
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,679
money is used like i want to support

2717
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,840
schools or i i like this idea of a new

2718
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,600
light bulb i like that

2719
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,119
i like that business idea that this

2720
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,280
person came up with i'd like to

2721
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,199
give them a subsidy or i'd like to give

2722
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,320
them a

2723
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,000
loan or a donation or something like

2724
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,040
that again this is all very transparent

2725
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,480
and and again as time goes on incomes uh

2726
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,520
become more equal

2727
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,800
so that and then because incomes become

2728
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,760
more equal

2729
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,679
everyone has equal amount of of power

2730
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,239
in the cbfs to direct how the community

2731
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:03,040
spends its money

2732
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,520
the green lines in this figure are

2733
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:08,639
dollars

2734
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,960
and obviously you have to pay taxes and

2735
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:11,840
dollars the

2736
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,440
the government's not going to accept

2737
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,600
tokens so um

2738
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,639
uh you paid all taxes and dollars the

2739
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,320
government also provides some income

2740
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,760
support for people who are unemployed

2741
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,320
that's

2742
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,560
natural normal the government also

2743
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,520
provides some grants and contracts and

2744
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,320
subsidies to

2745
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,880
organizations that's quite normal and

2746
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,520
the

2747
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,400
organ organizations that our members

2748
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,000
also have to deal with

2749
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,280
the outside world they have to sell

2750
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,199
their goods and and

2751
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,239
exchange uh goods and services

2752
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,800
using dollars so those are the green

2753
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,639
lines

2754
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,639
uh so that's how the basic system works

2755
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,159
and then i and then as this

2756
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,320
this the system evolves over a period of

2757
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,080
28 years in the simulation

2758
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,679
and i'll show you what the results are

2759
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,199
as the as

2760
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,440
as everything goes round and round we're

2761
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,239
not going to have

2762
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,679
we only have a few minutes left so i'm

2763
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,199
going to kind of have to get just get to

2764
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,560
the point here

2765
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,639
there's some assumptions uh on the next

2766
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,600
slide

2767
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,080
what john can i just ask um which of

2768
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:10,960
these agents are

2769
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,719
active inference agents or where does

2770
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,320
active inference come into play

2771
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,920
or could come into play with later

2772
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,119
versions of this simulation

2773
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,639
um okay so again the the the um

2774
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,639
the leader framework is an integrated

2775
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,639
system that has a governance component

2776
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:27,040
if

2777
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,719
the governance component has a

2778
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,159
legislative component

2779
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,800
and you know all the major six

2780
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,480
overarching systems are addressed in

2781
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,760
some way

2782
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,480
i'm only simulating the economic part

2783
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,520
right so

2784
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,679
so if you were in a real club and a real

2785
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,119
club looked anything like the leader

2786
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,800
there would be a governance system that

2787
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,360
you would

2788
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,280
be you know participating in some kind

2789
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,920
of collaborative governance system

2790
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,600
to help decide you know what should

2791
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,440
happen in the community that'd be the

2792
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,080
legislative system legal system and so

2793
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,880
on

2794
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,080
uh education system and everything so

2795
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,920
that's one way that active imprints

2796
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,760
would be involved just in the process of

2797
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,880
decision making under uncertainty right

2798
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,159
and in the in this particular simulation

2799
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,840
you know obviously businesses are having

2800
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,760
to make decisions and choose

2801
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,800
choose what they do with their resources

2802
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,239
so that's another way that

2803
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,040
cognition is happening and then maybe

2804
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:21,840
the main

2805
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,560
in this economic picture maybe the main

2806
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,560
agent is the cbfs that's a that's a

2807
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,760
financial system where everyone

2808
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,560
is able to participate in a transparent

2809
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,000
and democratic way

2810
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,400
to fund those things that they think are

2811
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,239
useful to their community that create

2812
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,280
the kind of jobs

2813
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,679
that they want to create to you know do

2814
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,679
as a community do we want

2815
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,920
lots of non-profit jobs do we want

2816
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,840
for-profit jobs do we want

2817
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,040
jobs in the manufacturing center do we

2818
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,280
manufacturing sector do we want you know

2819
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,119
like do we want to support this kind of

2820
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:00,560
business do we want to support that kind

2821
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,440
of business

2822
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,360
these are all decisions that the

2823
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,280
community makes through the cdfs

2824
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,760
and then you know if if the community

2825
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,000
decides like yeah we want this bakery

2826
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,199
this would be great

2827
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,600
or this bookstore or this farm or

2828
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,880
whatever it is

2829
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,040
then the community can you know

2830
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,199
associate within the cbfs and say okay

2831
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,800
there's a thousand of us we like this

2832
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,159
idea for this farm

2833
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,119
here's funding for it so you know go for

2834
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,480
it

2835
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,320
so active inference particularly would

2836
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,119
be happening in the cpfs

2837
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:32,800
yeah steven a question and then anyone

2838
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,520
else with a question

2839
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,280
yeah i suppose in a way you've seen a

2840
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,880
mix here between

2841
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,719
like in the in the red boxes you could

2842
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,080
have active inference

2843
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,159
like the dynamical non-linear systems of

2844
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,000
inference and then you've got this

2845
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,760
message passing

2846
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,760
which to some extent is then the

2847
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:52,880
aggregated

2848
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,920
system the sort of steady equilibrium

2849
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,480
system

2850
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,800
i the pile of money or the spreadsheet

2851
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,119
and a message passing where data goes

2852
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:03,920
from one

2853
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,280
to another but then within that

2854
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,040
there may have to be another process of

2855
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,800
inference that happens assuming people

2856
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,639
have any agency and it's not just

2857
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,520
all automated so it's like to me that's

2858
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,800
probably where you've got

2859
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,119
system dynamics in that diagram and then

2860
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,239
you've got these

2861
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,520
inside that non-linear dynamical systems

2862
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,080
i.e the inference processes embedded

2863
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,960
inside

2864
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,199
yeah there obviously is a lot going on

2865
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,480
there that we're not going to have time

2866
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,920
to talk about because we have like five

2867
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,600
minutes left or ten minutes left

2868
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,239
but but just to give you one example of

2869
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,080
that

2870
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,280
suppose that a a a group

2871
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,960
in the community wants to create some

2872
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,000
kind of business and they want to

2873
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,920
produce some kind of product right

2874
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,679
so they come to the cpfs and say hey we

2875
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,199
want to make this new thing well

2876
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,960
a lot of information has to go back and

2877
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,800
forth right this is an information

2878
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,159
rich system so i wanna if i'm gonna

2879
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:00,239
if i'm gonna support this with my

2880
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,639
resources in the cbfs i wanna know

2881
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,159
where you get what you know where are

2882
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,679
you getting the raw materials

2883
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,760
how is that impacting the environment

2884
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,239
how is your product going to improve or

2885
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:13,679
harm my our sense of community or

2886
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,520
any one of the metrics that we're

2887
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,199
measuring

2888
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,280
how is that gonna is there any pollution

2889
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,560
how are you gonna deal with your waste

2890
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,159
how much energy do you need

2891
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,719
uh do we have that that level of energy

2892
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,480
like electricity or whatever

2893
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,400
as a community do we have that resource

2894
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,080
about i mean there's an enormous amount

2895
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,320
of discussion and information has to

2896
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,600
flow between these

2897
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,760
different parties in order to make the

2898
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,040
kind of decisions that you know

2899
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,480
intelligent decisions that you would

2900
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,600
want to make in the cbfs

2901
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,480
okay so um in the few minutes that we

2902
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:44,960
have

2903
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,280
remaining if you could turn to slide 15

2904
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,400
please

2905
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,880
all right go for it so these are some of

2906
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,320
the results um

2907
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,600
uh um

2908
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,199
and i should say that um some of these

2909
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,159
that right at the get-go as the

2910
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,600
community is forming as a club is

2911
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,639
forming you know

2912
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,840
they would be choosing their trajectory

2913
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,320
they would be and and this upper

2914
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,480
left-hand corner is an example of that

2915
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,800
they would be choosing that they want

2916
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,199
income to rise to a certain level over

2917
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:18,080
time that

2918
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,719
they want participation to happen in

2919
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,280
this club at a certain rate over time

2920
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,600
they want to uh they want in particular

2921
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,320
the lower

2922
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,000
lower left there they want the income

2923
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,360
target to rise

2924
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,119
at a certain rate over time and um

2925
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,199
and obviously you can't ju you you know

2926
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:36,560
like you can't just

2927
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,040
flood a community with money on day one

2928
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,480
and expect that to work

2929
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,320
because there's no the same with uh say

2930
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,600
with digital currency

2931
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,360
because there's no no place to spend it

2932
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,119
like there's you know it's a tool for

2933
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,960
voting and if there's no place to vote

2934
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,199
the tool is useless right so that's

2935
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,520
partly why things grow slowly over time

2936
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,960
so that there becomes

2937
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,159
outlets for using the currency it you

2938
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,239
know and

2939
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:04,159
to create the kind of economy and and

2940
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,480
economic system that the community wants

2941
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,600
so

2942
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,199
some of these things would be decided

2943
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:10,719
ahead of time like here's what we want

2944
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,320
as a trajectory here's what we're

2945
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,560
here's what we're doing as a community

2946
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,000
using the system

2947
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,280
this is where we're going this is what

2948
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,800
we're going to do this is how it works

2949
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,679
and if we all

2950
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,840
cooperate in this way that's exactly how

2951
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,520
it's going to

2952
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,520
happen you know that's that's the

2953
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,440
concept is so it's not just

2954
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,600
here's a system use it however you want

2955
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,040
let's see how it goes

2956
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,920
it's really more you know we we're a

2957
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,840
community that we have a goal

2958
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,000
and here's how we intend to reach our

2959
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,960
goal we want

2960
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,360
say for example we want incomes to rise

2961
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,199
to a certain level over time

2962
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:47,280
and this is you know can this system do

2963
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:47,920
that

2964
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,600
and if the answer is yes well then

2965
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,639
here's how we're going to do it we're

2966
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,280
going to

2967
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,199
increase it a certain amount every year

2968
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,520
and it's all going to work out

2969
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,600
and and so in that sense some of this

2970
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,119
should be no there should be no

2971
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,960
surprises for the community as they do a

2972
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,400
field trial it should be

2973
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,239
working exactly the way they intended it

2974
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,400
to work bringing them where they want to

2975
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,760
go for example when you drive a car on a

2976
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,920
trip you you know where you want to go

2977
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,119
if you're halfway there

2978
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,960
if it's a two-day trip and on day one

2979
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,560
you're halfway there then you know

2980
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,480
you're moving in the right direction

2981
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,239
it's all going just where you intended

2982
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,920
to go

2983
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,960
okay so um on this slide

2984
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,880
i may be on the lower right hand corner

2985
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,360
uh this is what happens over 30 years as

2986
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,199
the simulation moves forward

2987
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,760
uh the this is showing average family

2988
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,400
income

2989
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,440
in the in the membership it starts at a

2990
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,440
fairly low level this is from the census

2991
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,360
data this is where they start

2992
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,480
on your zero at your zero and every year

2993
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,840
the average family in income increases

2994
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,760
essentially the leader is paying people

2995
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,119
to join

2996
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,600
either because the because the income

2997
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,280
target is rising

2998
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,560
and my income is go my wages are going

2999
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,480
up as the income target goes up

3000
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,440
or i actually have make a lot of money

3001
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,440
but i'm joining anyway just to get that

3002
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,080
bonus

3003
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,480
uh you know whatever it is a thousand

3004
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,920
dollars a year in tokens or whatever

3005
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,760
that bonus is

3006
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,800
so people are joining because it is it

3007
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,040
is

3008
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,440
in their economic best interest to join

3009
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,239
and as

3010
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:23,280
it goes on the income target rises

3011
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,520
and then family income you can see the

3012
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,480
blue line there

3013
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,040
family income average family income more

3014
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,239
than doubles over the

3015
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:34,560
30-year period so uh the average family

3016
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,679
is

3017
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,360
between tokens and dollars the average

3018
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,040
family income is over it's

3019
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,560
around 110 000 annually as as time goes

3020
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,119
on

3021
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:46,560
now i might note that the dollar

3022
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,480
aspect obviously the community needs to

3023
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,400
bring in dollars in order for this to

3024
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,840
happen because some of the

3025
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,600
income is paid and some of the wages are

3026
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,040
paid in dollars and some are paid in

3027
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,480
tokens

3028
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,800
so part of what this community is doing

3029
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,239
is they're adjusting

3030
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,119
their outflows they're adjusting their

3031
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,199
transactions with the rest of the world

3032
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,679
such that they're keeping dollars in

3033
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:08,480
circulation

3034
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,280
longer than would other but otherwise be

3035
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,320
natural

3036
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,119
so for example there's a like a buy

3037
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,320
local program

3038
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,600
and there's ways to support uh local

3039
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,920
local businesses and keep money keep

3040
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,760
dollars circulating in their local

3041
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,119
economy longer

3042
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,679
and in the end what happens is at this

3043
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:28,480
high

3044
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,040
income level what what actually happens

3045
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,840
is

3046
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,600
the community is is is increasing

3047
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,040
the the number of dollars in circulation

3048
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,600
locally

3049
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,719
up to the point where their

3050
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:45,440
average dollar income is the national

3051
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:45,920
dollar

3052
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,960
in average national dollar income so you

3053
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,280
know

3054
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,600
like today in today's world the incomes

3055
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,800
are very very

3056
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,400
uh unequal there's

3057
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,719
a few extremely wealthy people and most

3058
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,480
everyone else is

3059
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,119
not making very much but there is an

3060
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:04,080
average dollar

3061
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,080
you know average dollar income over the

3062
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,560
country and what the leader is doing

3063
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,199
over time

3064
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:12,560
is is kind of pulling dollars into their

3065
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,239
local system such that

3066
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:16,159
they're just reaching the average

3067
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:17,280
overtime

3068
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,960
and then they so they're reaching the

3069
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,480
average

3070
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,400
average dollar income which is about 70

3071
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,920
000 or so dollars

3072
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,159
and then they're also have on top of

3073
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,520
that uh

3074
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,600
income in tokens which the community is

3075
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,520
creating so between the tokens and

3076
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,440
dollars eventually they get to the point

3077
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,320
where

3078
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,800
where they're having about a family

3079
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:37,840
income of about a hundred and ten

3080
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,239
thousand

3081
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:41,600
thousand uh so

3082
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,600
somebody had said earlier that you know

3083
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,360
maybe it was you daniel that i'm both

3084
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,360
i'm both saying that money is a

3085
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,679
different animal in this system and

3086
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:52,080
motivations are different and in the

3087
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,600
next breath i'm saying

3088
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,600
oh this is a motivation you could you

3089
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,719
can make more money

3090
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,119
so like both of those things are true at

3091
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,560
the same time

3092
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,679
and um and there's a transition period

3093
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:04,400
where we go

3094
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,320
from here to there right i mean this

3095
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,000
whole thing just doesn't happen

3096
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,679
overnight if we want to transform

3097
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:12,800
society it takes time and

3098
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,679
uh so in this transition period we might

3099
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:16,320
be

3100
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,480
we might be thinking of money and income

3101
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,159
in both ways like

3102
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,159
in the more traditional sense of i need

3103
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,239
money to pay my rent and then in the new

3104
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,119
sense of

3105
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,840
money is a voting tool and uh we all

3106
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,639
need to have

3107
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,320
more or less equal income so that we

3108
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,080
have more less equal voting

3109
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,040
power in this community now what happens

3110
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,040
happens after 30 years or 50 years you

3111
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,880
know maybe our understanding of all of

3112
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
this deepens and widens and

3113
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,239
um you know maybe the the current

3114
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,119
concepts of money and economy fall away

3115
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,080
over time

3116
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,600
in exchange for this new new uh focus on

3117
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,760
cognition and well-being and

3118
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,560
uh value of community depending on how

3119
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,280
well

3120
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,199
it's thriving is is this is the code

3121
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,360
is the code or the formalism available

3122
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,040
because people might tweak a parameter

3123
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,480
and get a totally different response

3124
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,920
they might include another variable or

3125
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,199
another function get a totally different

3126
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:09,840
outcome

3127
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,679
so how can we actually version this in

3128
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:12,960
an open source way

3129
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,480
so that we can be working together on

3130
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,320
something that's transparent

3131
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,159
yeah yeah the code was made of open

3132
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,920
source but made available

3133
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,280
publicly back in 2014 um

3134
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,199
and i also there's a

3135
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,000
interactive simulation on the website it

3136
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,199
needs a little

3137
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:32,960
artwork but it functions so you can go

3138
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,440
to the website

3139
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,679
principalsocietiesproject.org and you

3140
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:36,159
can

3141
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,840
to some degree you can type in some

3142
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,280
different numbers and see how that

3143
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,440
all works out so you can play with it a

3144
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,719
little bit on the website

3145
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:45,840
uh but beyond that um this simulation is

3146
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,960
really quite simple

3147
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,800
and if i were to recode it i might

3148
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,480
record it in a different way today you

3149
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,040
know that i did back in 2014

3150
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,719
but this the simulation is really quite

3151
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,159
simple it needs

3152
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,560
this is just a first glance of a

3153
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,040
conceptual glance of how this could work

3154
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,639
and it needs all kinds of work there's

3155
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,320
all kinds of ways that we could expand

3156
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,560
this

3157
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,639
that you know there's a lot of questions

3158
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:10,080
that need to be answered and we could

3159
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,760
expand the simulation to

3160
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,679
answer questions better or address more

3161
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,040
questions so

3162
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,560
uh so you know you can download the code

3163
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:19,360
that i put up

3164
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,599
in 2014 but you know ideally i think we

3165
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,040
would move forward and

3166
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,719
develop you know kind of a more

3167
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,400
functional framework for this that we

3168
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,000
could try out different approaches

3169
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,520
and different ways to do it

3170
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,639
um uh maybe on the slide 16

3171
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,960
in these last few minutes this is maybe

3172
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,040
the one of the kicker slides you can see

3173
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,159
on the right the histogram of this is

3174
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:43,520
this

3175
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,440
starting distribution of income in the

3176
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,520
county

3177
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,880
and then below is the

3178
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
income distribution at the end of the

3179
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,800
30-year period and you can see

3180
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,239
practically everybody is making this 110

3181
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:01,679
000 in currency per year

3182
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,119
on the left you can see how the

3183
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,960
unemployment rate changes it starts at

3184
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,080
about seven percent

3185
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,440
or so uh in the county and drops down

3186
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,880
to essentially full employment

3187
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,960
on the next slide slide 17

3188
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,239
on the top left is the curve of how much

3189
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:22,639
money is in circulation in the cbfs over

3190
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:23,440
time

3191
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,119
and you can see that about 6 billion in

3192
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,880
currency circulates annually at the end

3193
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,719
of 30 years in the cbfs

3194
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,080
so again this is a highly transparent

3195
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,040
uh deeply democratic and collaborative

3196
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:39,760
way to

3197
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,840
decide how money should be spent in the

3198
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,880
community

3199
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,440
and imagine and this is a very very

3200
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,440
small community over like 100 000 people

3201
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,800
or something like that so

3202
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,639
this is six billion dollars for a

3203
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,480
hundred thousand people to decide how

3204
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,840
they want to

3205
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,080
you know what they want for their

3206
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,679
community what kind of jobs they want

3207
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:58,800
what kind of

3208
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,560
what kind of uh you know how many

3209
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,199
non-profits they want versus for-profits

3210
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,599
how what they want like you know that's

3211
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:08,639
a lot of money

3212
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,239
and with that much money a community

3213
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:12,560
would have

3214
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,000
enormous flexibility and capacity

3215
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,679
to make the kinds of decisions that it

3216
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:19,280
would want to make about how how it

3217
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,119
lives its life

3218
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:23,119
maybe that's the that's the you know

3219
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,560
that's maybe the main

3220
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,800
slides the main results essentially

3221
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,239
income more than doubles

3222
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:29,840
enormous amount of money circulates

3223
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,440
annually in the cbfs

3224
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,440
and the community gets decide gets to

3225
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,199
decide in a very transparent and deeply

3226
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:36,159
democratic way

3227
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,960
how that money is spent so maybe we'll

3228
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,000
end there since

3229
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,080
we're out of time but there's obviously

3230
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,599
a lot more details in the simulation

3231
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:44,000
paper

3232
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,119
and anyone can read that to pick up more

3233
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:49,360
thanks so much john so we'll chill for a

3234
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,960
few more minutes people can drop off

3235
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,560
whenever they want to but maybe if

3236
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,719
anyone who wants to raise their hand

3237
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:57,840
uh and give a final thought but it's

3238
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:58,719
awesome that the

3239
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:00,560
code is posted maybe you can add that in

3240
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,239
a youtube comment

3241
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,239
because it'd be awesome to see maybe

3242
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:05,920
where this even plays nicely with the

3243
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,520
active inference models that we've been

3244
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,560
exploring

3245
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,760
in these recent discussions

3246
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,960
so any um one wants to raise their hand

3247
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,760
give a few more

3248
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,040
seconds for that also one note

3249
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,280
about um communication and stephen was

3250
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,320
talking about like the

3251
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,679
agents active inference agents and

3252
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:25,679
message passing between agents also we

3253
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:26,239
know that

3254
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:28,480
message passing is a mechanism by which

3255
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,159
active inference can be computed within

3256
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:32,000
an agent there's a lot of cool papers

3257
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,199
on that and it reminded me of um some

3258
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,119
work that i had done in the eu social

3259
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,560
insects in the ants

3260
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,560
which investigated how physiological

3261
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,639
mechanisms that were inside

3262
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:45,280
of a solitary insect's body like related

3263
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,280
to the regulation of foraging

3264
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,679
over evolutionary time in the colony

3265
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:50,639
context

3266
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:53,360
become rewired to be playing out across

3267
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,560
multiple bodies

3268
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,080
so the regulation of foraging for a

3269
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:59,040
solitary insect is all on board the fly

3270
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,719
but the regulation of foraging for the

3271
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:01,920
ant colony is something that's

3272
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,880
distributed

3273
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,599
and it got there through evolution and

3274
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:06,960
hundreds of millions of years

3275
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,000
of it working so yes there are

3276
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,760
failures just because one is seeking a

3277
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,040
goal doesn't mean that they reach the

3278
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:13,520
goal

3279
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,599
most ant species of course are extinct

3280
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,440
but it does point to this way

3281
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,199
where the kinds of connections that are

3282
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,639
inside of an agent

3283
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:22,480
can be of one kind and then the

3284
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,239
communications between agents can be

3285
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:24,639
different

3286
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,560
we see that with neurons with ants with

3287
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,920
societies and

3288
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,639
by having a scale free framework like

3289
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:31,840
active inference

3290
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,000
we could rethink how communication

3291
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,239
happens inside and outside so that we

3292
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:38,480
can take some agency ourselves

3293
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,000
in designing our niche in our

3294
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,080
evolutionary transitions upcoming

3295
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,599
so dave and then lee

3296
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:49,599
um i see some um

3297
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:52,960
data from the actual physical economy

3298
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,880
in eugene is there um any interest

3299
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,719
in setting up um leon tf matrices

3300
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:03,119
and running an actual physical

3301
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,360
simulation of the economy so

3302
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,440
you don't just swap everything into into

3303
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,199
money but actually use

3304
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:13,119
physical activity and see whether you're

3305
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:15,679
exceeding break even over a period of

3306
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:17,199
decades

3307
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,679
i'm not if you mean by physical you mean

3308
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,199
like an actual

3309
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,119
club yes that's where all of this is

3310
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,480
going you know like in in

3311
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,480
in whatever would take six years ten

3312
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,920
years whenever this is ready

3313
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,320
yes let's do a real let's do a field

3314
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,920
trial in a real club and see how this

3315
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:32,719
works

3316
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:35,840
but if you're talking about more like

3317
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,199
uh in silico sure all i'm looking at

3318
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,560
here is just

3319
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,760
some simple metrics about about this

3320
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,719
change exchange of currency but there's

3321
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:48,239
all kinds of things that have to be

3322
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:50,239
exchanged and considered there's

3323
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:52,639
energy there's wastes there's you know

3324
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,560
pollutants there's uh

3325
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,280
there's raw materials there's uh human

3326
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,800
resources there's

3327
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,880
like all of these things all of the

3328
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,560
components could become

3329
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,639
part of a simulation model and should

3330
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:07,280
become part of simulation models over

3331
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:07,920
time

3332
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,520
so again this is a very very simple

3333
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,280
simulation and there's tremendous

3334
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,679
opportunities to expand it and make it

3335
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,599
more meaningful

3336
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,400
thanks lee

3337
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:24,000
i am sorry um i'm gonna try and get two

3338
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,599
questions for the price of one

3339
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:28,159
so my first question is um given that

3340
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:29,599
there's you know you see this kind of

3341
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:32,639
prelude phase um what

3342
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,520
what would you see as uh priorities

3343
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,960
initial priorities for

3344
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,719
for research then to get this really

3345
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:40,480
moving yeah

3346
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,639
i mean good question and and and i wish

3347
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,840
i had a uh

3348
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,040
you know a clear path to let's do a b c

3349
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,320
and d and then it's all going to work

3350
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,719
out but i don't so we have to decide

3351
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:52,320
that together really i mean

3352
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,880
i could i i could come up with a list of

3353
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,840
ideas that we could all discuss together

3354
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,480
you know for just one is the these kinds

3355
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,719
of simulation models could be expanded

3356
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,239
but there's other things too for example

3357
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,560
it would be really interesting

3358
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,639
to just do a survey either of the

3359
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:10,400
general population in

3360
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,239
you know in one country or maybe

3361
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,440
multiple countries

3362
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,840
or do a simulation of the global in the

3363
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,599
global science community and just say

3364
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,280
to scientists you know if this

3365
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,719
kind of r d program were were available

3366
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:27,040
or were you know it was activated and

3367
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,400
there was funding available

3368
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,560
would you be interested in participating

3369
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,520
in this you know like

3370
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,199
it would be really interesting to know

3371
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,800
is there support for this

3372
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,800
in the scientific community and in the

3373
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,480
public does the public

3374
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,840
is the public interested in

3375
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,159
fundamentally new systems

3376
01:57:42,159 --> 01:57:44,000
you know those would be interesting

3377
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,320
questions there could be media

3378
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,760
some you know somebody should make a

3379
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,760
documentary about the concept of

3380
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,760
society as a cognitive organism what we

3381
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:52,880
could become

3382
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,800
you know like they could be art projects

3383
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,159
there could be media projects it could

3384
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:58,840
be literature projects that could be

3385
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,119
simulations there could be surveys there

3386
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:01,840
could be

3387
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,320
assessments of say you know choose some

3388
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,239
community somewhere maybe a smallish

3389
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:07,040
community

3390
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,920
and assess what is their uh how do we

3391
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,480
apply

3392
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,199
metrics to their current fitness what

3393
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:14,800
kind of metrics they could be work on

3394
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,080
metrics so they could be work on

3395
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,199
applying metrics

3396
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,159
to a to an existing community just as a

3397
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,159
just to get a background of like where

3398
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:23,520
are we now

3399
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,880
and and how would we collect this

3400
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,800
information there could be that would

3401
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,040
you know there could be work on computer

3402
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,239
models to be like

3403
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:32,880
you know if we had 50 metrics how do we

3404
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,239
combine them into some

3405
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:37,040
something meaningful for uh you know for

3406
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,440
making decisions you know like so

3407
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:42,639
or on the topic of tools how

3408
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,840
what kind of tool would allow 10 000

3409
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,760
people to richly communicate

3410
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:51,360
and make decisions together and and

3411
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,920
how can i give how can i tell my story

3412
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,560
to

3413
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,480
a thousand people or ten thousand people

3414
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,560
how can i can tell how can i tell my

3415
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,639
story my narrative my understanding of

3416
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:01,280
things

3417
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,599
in some rich way such that it is

3418
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:05,840
computed and used by the whole

3419
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,119
in a in a meaningful way there's also

3420
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:10,480
you know a few ideas

3421
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,880
you know the right yeah thanks for the

3422
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,719
answer and live stream

3423
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,480
is a new affordance it allows those to

3424
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,320
speak but with a hundred thousand people

3425
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:18,880
there isn't

3426
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,840
enough hours in the life to linearly

3427
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,199
hear from everyone

3428
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,800
and so when we want to speak and we want

3429
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,040
to hear and listen active listening

3430
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,040
passive speaking all these things how

3431
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,159
are we going to make that happen at

3432
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:31,119
scale so

3433
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:33,440
awesome questions you're raising steven

3434
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,880
and anyone else and then we'll

3435
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,440
close out

3436
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,880
yeah i think the scale question keeps

3437
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,960
coming up right that's the

3438
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,400
start to realize that's that's

3439
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,320
everywhere but often is

3440
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,520
is not talked about um one thing

3441
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,159
just uh sort of to finish off was

3442
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,679
there's the inferences

3443
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:58,560
about how to act in the world

3444
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,159
which but there's also the ways to get

3445
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:03,440
an insight

3446
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:07,599
into the influences that we're making

3447
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,159
so in some ways i always think this is

3448
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,440
giving a way to

3449
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:16,159
look more deeply um and go beyond

3450
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:18,560
you know system dynamics which is used

3451
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,599
quite a lot in

3452
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:22,639
population work but to go into this

3453
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:26,000
kind of um way to sort of say

3454
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,639
okay we're not necessarily creating

3455
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:29,520
these clubs

3456
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,599
to tell you what to do and to replace

3457
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,080
other government structures but to give

3458
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,360
other ways to get insight

3459
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,400
into what is going on

3460
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,679
in the inference process here yeah

3461
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:46,719
excellent excellent so this is um

3462
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,800
you know potential this whole concept is

3463
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,840
potentially useful

3464
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,719
for making actually making decisions

3465
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:54,080
decisions for the future

3466
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:57,520
as a by a group but also for individuals

3467
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,520
and a group to understand

3468
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,679
how are we how do we cognitive how are

3469
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:03,840
we cogniting

3470
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,679
how can we do how could we cognate

3471
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:08,000
better or how do we cognate how does

3472
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,159
how do we actually function you know

3473
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:11,760
like all of these are questions and all

3474
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,239
of these are open to assessment

3475
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:17,760
and you know like i could imagine

3476
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,599
thousands if this went forward there

3477
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,239
could be thousands of papers

3478
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:24,960
on all kinds of topics not just about

3479
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,840
cognition but

3480
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,360
you know that would include cognition

3481
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,520
about how does it actually work how do

3482
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,520
humans how do humans associate and

3483
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,800
cognite together

3484
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,920
what a time it will be so thank you john

3485
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,280
it was great to have you on and the six

3486
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,800
appearances were just the tip of the

3487
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,280
iceberg so we look forward to continuing

3488
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,040
the discussion with you with seeing you

3489
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,960
in our tools organizational

3490
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,520
unit where we're really inspired to be

3491
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,840
working towards developing some of those

3492
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,040
things that you're suggesting that

3493
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,119
there's a need for so thanks everyone

3494
02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:00,880
for joining live and for watching and

3495
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,280
for the awesome questions yvonne natalia

3496
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:07,280
etc so we'll see you in the coming weeks

3497
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,719
with future papers and future

3498
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:11,599
discussions so see you later

3499
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:18,639
thanks much bye
