1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
hello and welcome everyone to actinflab

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,480
this is active live stream number

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,039
21.1

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,840
and we're here with john boyk and

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
several other colleagues looking forward

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,240
to a discussion today

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
on this science-driven societal

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
transformation series

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,439
and project that we've been exploring

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,320
and

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
uh had several background sessions dot

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,559
zero one through dot zero four with john

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,520
and in the discussion today and next

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
week we're gonna be looking to draw out

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
some threads and include some new

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
perspectives and hear from the questions

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
that people may have

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
and for these

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
discussions we're going to be using the

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
same jamboards that we were using for

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
the discussions with just john and i

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,640
and we're gonna jump around the

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
jamboards we're gonna hear questions

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
from anyone who wants to ask live or in

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
uh the youtube chat

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
and we'll have fun so we'll just start

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,680
with introductions and then get a quick

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
little recap and off we go so i'm daniel

development

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
and i'm researching how

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,439
social topographies can be used across

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,640
scales

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
of community psychology and other

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
development practices

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
and i'm going to pass it over to lee

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
thanks stephen

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
uh i'm lee i'm a researcher based at the

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
university of york and

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
i'm studying systems transformation and

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
my supervisor is johan fazee who i think

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,759
you've drawn a little bit john in a

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
couple of these patients

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
i was

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,120
really really happy to uh find someone

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
else looking at systems transformation

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
and um active inference at the same time

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
but although i think you're a lot

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
further down the line than i am in

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
thinking about this so really look

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239

faculty at oregon state university and

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
the purpose of these talks

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
is to discuss the series of papers that

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
i just recently published in the journal

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
sustainability

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
the title is science driven societal

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,280
transformation parts one two and three

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
and if you would go we're going to do a

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,920
quick recap of some of the material that

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
we've discussed before we'll jump around

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
a little bit just to

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400

so this just is the pictures of the

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
different papers

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
the links are done on the lower left so

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
in case anyone wants to check out the

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
papers

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
please do they're all open source

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
frequently freely available

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
and we're going to focus today we'll

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
jump around a little bit and capture the

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,440
main main topics but we're going to

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
focus on part three design today

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
all right slide

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
two please

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
and as as we go through this

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,799
if there's

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
more questions if someone wants more

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
materials all of the links are available

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
all the links to all the papers and some

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,319
other

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
materials are available at

104
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
my website for this project principled

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
societies project

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
and i might mention there's also a

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
interactive model there that you can

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,599
delete a framework which we'll talk

109
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,400
about

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
so you can see how the economic

111
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,840
simulation

112
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,360
goes uh slide five

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
or slide four excuse me

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
yes

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
so what is the what is the purpose of

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,479
this what is the what is the problem

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
that this this series is trying to solve

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
um the problem that faces

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,199
society or really human civilization is

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
a host of

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
very large so far intractable problems

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
including climate change biodiversity

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
laws poverty

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
uh income and wealth inequality you know

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,919
you know soil soil depletion groundwater

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,400
depletion pollution i mean there's it's

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
a long list of very serious

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
problems that we face so serious in fact

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,639
that it's not clear at this point

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,840
how civilization will fare in the coming

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,800
decades even in the coming years i mean

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
the world is armed right now the world

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
is armed to its teeth with nuclear

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
weapons

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
so uh you know

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
any moment things could go awry or

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
or

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
things could just deteriorate

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
rapidly as climate change and

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
biodiversity loss gain speed

141
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
so hopefully we will solve our problems

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
hopefully as societies um hopefully we

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
will improve quality of life and quality

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,960
of the environment

145
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
uh but that is the per that is what

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
we're shooting for in the series is

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
pathways to do just that

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,000
i i would like to point out that this

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
series is focused on transformation in

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
the sense of the novo design of

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
fundamentally new systems societal

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
systems

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
which i talk about six i believe

154
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
so economic systems legal systems

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
financial systems

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,520
governance systems things like that

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
so the the the problem is the major uh

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,759
constellation of problems that we face

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
uh globally and the proposed solution

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
solution is to view society as a

161
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
cognitive organism

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
and just like any organism it has a

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,199
intrinsic purpose

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,039
of maintaining achieving and maintaining

165
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
vitality

166
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
so how does it do that how does any

167
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
organism survive it learns it develops

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
it learns it acts

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
it learns from its actions

170
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
and and it adapts to new conditions as

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
necessary

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,240
this series is actually a an r d pro

173
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
proposal it's it's aimed at the

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
uh

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
the global scientific body and my hope

176
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
is to interest the scientific world in

177
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,479
this

178
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
in this problem of

179
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
how do you transform how how could we

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
build a better society what if we were

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
to if we were to create

182
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
any conceivable way to organize society

183
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
any conceivable

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
economic systems or governance systems

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,319
or

186
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,919
legal systems

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
educational systems what would be the

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
best in terms of

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
quality of life and quality of the

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,840
environment and long-term

191
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
sustainability i think that's a question

192
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
that science is now capable of

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,599
addressing

194
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,039
perhaps this is the first time in

195
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
history that science had the tools and

196
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
the skill and the background and the

197
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
computational power to address these

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,440
kinds of very very large questions but i

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
think that we can do it now

200
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
the whole r d program is is is is

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
described as a as a

202
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
partnership between the global

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
scientific community and local

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
communities so

205
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
the idea here is to test and to build

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
create and test new systems at the local

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,720
level in in cooperation with local

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,870
volunteer communities

209
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,240
[Music]

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,199
um

211
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
and i and i talk about implementing

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
those systems and implementing field

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
tests via a club model which we'll

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,840
discuss a little bit more

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
uh okay so that's a very quick overview

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
um maybe on to slide five but first uh

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
stephen with a question and then anyone

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,759
else who's raising their hands sure just

219
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,279
keep checking at the hands yeah go ahead

220
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,880
stephen

221
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,519
thank you yeah just uh one question i i

222
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
know she mentioned um

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
architecture so you've got the idea of

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
architecture and you've got

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,919
um

226
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
these different things that we have got

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
in the

228
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
constellation

229
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,519
and i wonder if you could speak a little

230
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
bit more to

231
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
the idea of architecture and

232
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
how that relates to architectures in the

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
brain or maybe distributed systems of

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,959
the brain you know yeah you know

235
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
the brain is what i'm thinking of when i

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,399
use the work architecture well a little

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
bit i mean people talk about computing

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
frameworks and computing architectures

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
too but i really had in mind the way the

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
brain

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
functions

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
and

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
maybe i should make that even more broad

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
because if if we

245
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,040
if

246
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,839
if if climate change and biodiversity

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
loss and these other major problems that

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
we face

249
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
are symptoms of a cognitive dysfunction

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
at the societal level i mean that's what

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
i would call it the societal dysfunction

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
cognitive dysfunction because we've

253
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
known about these problems for decades

254
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
you know with climate change we've known

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,000
about it for

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
more than 50 years

257
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
and yet we have it we've failed to

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
you know

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
adequately address the issues

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
um so i i would say that all of these

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
major problems are symptoms of

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
a cognitive problem

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
or symptoms of a cognitive dysfunction

264
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,040
and then the question becomes okay well

265
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,760
if we're not cognating correctly

266
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
what kinds of where do we look for

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
better models where do we look for ideas

268
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
of how we might cognate better and i

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
would say that in the world of biology

270
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
including the human brain there's just

271
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
you know a million

272
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,839
or

273
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
a large number of examples that we can

274
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
learn from

275
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,240
like how does nature compute how

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
nature's been at this for a very very

277
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,680
long time

278
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
and how does how does it work in nature

279
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
and maybe we can

280
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
uh align ourselves with the same program

281
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
the same process that's going on all

282
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,760
around us

283
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
and if we do then there's i would say

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
there's the chance of

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
building systems that are much more

286
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
effective

287
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,760
at uh at uh achieving the the uh

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
intrinsic

289
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
um you know our goal which is to achieve

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,839
and maintain vitality

291
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
uh far into the future yes stephen and

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,399
then

293
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
and i was just gonna sort of building on

294
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
that because with active inference one

295
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
thing that sometimes comes up in uh

296
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
you know is that rather than the brain

297
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,880
being like a computer per se

298
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
that is a distributed and actually now

299
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,360
maybe even not even functionally

300
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,959
specialized in certain regions but you

301
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
know it's more of a distributed system

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
of which you know we're not exactly sure

303
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
exactly how all old that works but it

304
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,200
with the idea of it being a dynamical

305
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
sort of prediction engine so i'm i'm

306
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,760
wondering how

307
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
that could

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,040
how much might that inform

309
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
where you go with this

310
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
yeah totally because uh i i we're using

311
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
the word brain but but even when i'm

312
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,120
thinking brain i'm thinking whole body

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
and bodies connected to each other

314
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,560
other bodies in society that

315
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,440
i in in part one of the series

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
the title is called world view and i try

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
to set up a context for all of this and

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
it's part of that context i i i you know

319
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
i point out that everything is

320
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
intelligent like every piece of life is

321
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
connected to every other piece of life

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
you know either strongly or weakly and

323
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
and the whole whole of life is

324
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
processing information i mean that's

325
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
essentially what life is doing is

326
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
processing information

327
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
taking reducing the uncertainty about

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
the past or about the future from the

329
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
past

330
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
so yes absolutely um you know we have

331
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,279
the four e's for example

332
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
uh and we have uh

333
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
uh distributed we have

334
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,320
like

335
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
in part three i use the analogy of um

336
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,399
between neurons and and individuals in a

337
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,360
society and so how do neurons associate

338
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
with other and disassociate with other

339
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,399
there's a kind of a compliment as to how

340
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
people associate and disassociate with

341
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880
other with others in the in the process

342
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
of societal cognition

343
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
and so we have

344
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
connections

345
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
in the brain we have connections to our

346
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
bodies connections to our emotions

347
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
connections to our feet and fingertips

348
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
and connections to everything that is

349
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
happening around us in our in our

350
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,959
immediate environments connections to

351
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
each other and all of that plays a role

352
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
in cognition

353
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
okay so i'm not yeah so i'm talking

354
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,079
about

355
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,880
cognition in the large sense not in the

356
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
narrow sense and i'm certainly not

357
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
talking about a computer model that

358
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
tells everybody what to do that's that's

359
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
not at all what this is about

360
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
thanks sean lee and then anyone else who

361
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
raises their hand

362
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
um it was it's more of an observation

363
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
really um it's it's just when you were

364
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
saying that you were drawing on the

365
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
on the natural biological systems for

366
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
inspiration

367
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
kind of occurred to me that then what

368
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
you're doing is a kind of a a bio

369
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
mimicry

370
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
yes

371
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,560
but in

372
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
but you know building on stephen's point

373
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,279
it's not in the older sense of you know

374
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,800
the mind is computer but much more in

375
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
the kind of in your senses you know

376
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
biology at all levels being able to

377
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
cognite right

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,959
right absolutely

379
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,279
i think i read by but mr fuller he said

380
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,600
something one day that he said

381
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
i think i'm a process

382
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
not a thing

383
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,199
i'm paraphrasing there but that's right

384
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,399
it's like all of life is a process

385
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,360
an intelligent process

386
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
cool and and those and those uh just you

387
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
know i'll say it again but those ideas

388
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
really are new to science and and what

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,720
the

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,959
i mean you know the mainstream science

391
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
new to mainstream science in just the

392
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
last

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
two decades or something like that i

394
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
mean fairly recent concepts of

395
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,240
of uh complex systems that uh you know

396
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,079
cognitive systems

397
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,040
uh the interconnectedness of all things

398
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,199
the intelligence of all things trees

399
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
communicating with other trees through

400
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,560
you know through soil fungus and

401
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
all of these many of these ideas are

402
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,079
actually quite recent in the science

403
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,360
world

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
and a funny note on that is that

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
mainstream science is new in the social

406
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
cognition world the professionalization

407
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,519
of science

408
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,560
is a new

409
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
topic and a new genre and i really like

410
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,279
some of these points about distributed

411
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,360
systems we can think about distributed

412
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,639
systems within one level of analysis or

413
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
one system of interest like within the

414
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,480
ant colony it's a distributed system or

415
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,000
within the brain it's a distributed

416
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
system but once you start thinking about

417
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
brains

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,759
john you mentioned the 4e the extended

419
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
inactive embedded and cultured could be

420
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
more e adjectives but that brings out

421
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
the richness and says yes it's

422
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
distributed system amongst the neurons

423
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,920
in the brain

424
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
and then the brain is interfacing with

425
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
the body and the body with its niche and

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
the tools and the social affordances and

427
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,839
it's starting to sound like a lot of

428
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
topics that we've talked about on active

429
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,360
live streams

430
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
so it's so awesome to to see how

431
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
we're taking some threads from the past

432
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,240
and weaving them together and i hope

433
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
that we can draw this out how a

434
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
multi-scale distributed systems

435
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
perspective on cognition

436
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
coupled with a social transformation

437
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,839
agenda

438
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
and preference vectors representing

439
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
policy can get combined through active

440
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
inference into something that's applied

441
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,320
um right right how to act how to make

442
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,000
decisions under uncertainty that's what

443
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
all this all of this is about

444
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
as a as a counterpoint to some of that

445
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
or is a different view on some of what

446
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,600
we just talked about imagine if we can

447
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
look at how

448
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
our society treats individuals i mean we

449
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
can look at

450
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
extreme inequalities of wealth

451
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,360
and income

452
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,160
uh

453
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,720
different levels of access to healthcare

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
you know like there's there's all these

455
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
issues social issues that we face right

456
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
now

457
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
imagine if your brain acted that way

458
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
somehow you know with with different

459
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,959
neurons where some neurons were just

460
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
simply starved some neurons were

461
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
excluded from the computational process

462
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,000
some neurons were given very few

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,319
resources just barely enough to survive

464
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,559
and others had so many resources that

465
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,599
they were

466
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
they were like wasting their resources

467
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
because they had so much i mean imagine

468
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
how well the brain or how poorly the

469
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,520
brain might

470
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
function if that's the way neurons

471
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
interacted if that was the community if

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
if the community of neurons was anything

473
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
like the community of individuals in our

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,280
society we wouldn't be able to

475
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
make hardly any good decisions we'd be a

476
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
mess

477
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
and we are a mess it reminds me of

478
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
dennett's fame in the brain model

479
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
and uh the firing rates of neurons are

480
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,160
not identical some are firing many times

481
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,559
per second others fire

482
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,039
not even in a day perhaps

483
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
so there's there's a lot

484
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
of distributions in these complex

485
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,000
systems

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,679
and how do we think about the whole

487
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,760
distribution as an outcome of a complex

488
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
process rather than just trying to

489
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,000
identify some sort of an outlier or some

490
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
sort of single phenomena it's it's uh

491
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
not the leverage point that system

492
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,880
interventions will be effective at so

493
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
stephen

494
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
and then any other raised hands

495
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
this also ties in i think nicely with

496
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,720
the idea of post-normal science um the

497
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
idea that in the post-normal science

498
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
world where you in high levels of

499
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
uncertainty you have to make decisions

500
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,679
so covid is a

501
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,000
classic case right we didn't they had to

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
make choices in january february march

503
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
april even now and you don't have the

504
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
data right you don't know

505
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
and in the same way with active

506
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,720
inference the brain and

507
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
different parts of the body are making

508
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
action policy selections

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
as is

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,320
going to inform

511
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,960
action and that's not quite the normal

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
realm of where science is you're in this

513
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
but this is where we're going to be

514
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
going as we hit climate change and all

515
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
sorts of other complex questions so

516
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,160
uh

517
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
that also is quite an interesting tie-in

518
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
because um kristen i know if you know

519
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
but he did some modelling on kobit 19 as

520
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
well yeah he's got into that yeah john

521
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
maybe you could um unpack that in the

522
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
context of second order science which

523
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
you discussed in the papers

524
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
yeah or yeah or maybe i can just pass it

525
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
to lee and you can say

526
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,080
two words

527
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
yeah

528
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
i know i'm happy to um

529
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
so uh

530
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,640
the

531
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
the concept of second order science

532
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,640
really is is just that the the idea that

533
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,120
the scientists can't be separated from

534
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,400
the systems that they are studying so

535
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
really where that's kind of led to in

536
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
systems transformation research is is

537
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
that the only way that we can really

538
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
understand systems is by engaging with

539
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
them and and learning how to change them

540
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
ourselves so we can't kind of stand back

541
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
and just try and focus on epistemic

542
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,960
knowledge alone really and that also

543
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,559
implies this kind of second order

544
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,799
understanding of ourselves and how our

545
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,880
own cognitive systems work as part of

546
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
the systems that we are engaging with

547
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,159
and yeah that was a value-driven

548
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
value-driven science where the or the

549
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
scientist is part of the experiment with

550
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
the stakeholders

551
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,840
absolutely

552
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,880
while we have you here that paper by

553
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
faisy was was authored by a very large

554
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
number of people it seemed

555
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,799
and i can you just say if you know the

556
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,080
story behind that uh

557
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,559
uh well a little bit i think it was

558
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,440
authored before i started uh studying

559
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
with him but um there's

560
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
a transformation community really i

561
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
guess of researchers and i think it

562
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,159
probably came out of one of the

563
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,840
conferences

564
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
that's been going on so it's a it's sort

565
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
of the product of the of a discussion

566
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,000
between

567
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
many researchers which is the way that

568
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
they kind of prefer to write really so

569
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
again like moving away from this idea of

570
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
you know the single genius to let's kind

571
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
of gather and figure this stuff out

572
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
together

573
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,200
right

574
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,520
i i reference uh

575
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
paper uh

576
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
several times in my part number two so

577
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,520
uh

578
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
readers can see how that fits into the

579
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
bigger picture here and it's it's uh

580
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
funny that that idea that the product of

581
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,400
research is collaborative it's a call

582
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,159
and a phenotype it's a group phenotype

583
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
how well this paper is and how many

584
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
people cite it and how much impact it

585
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,200
have it's not going to be reduced back

586
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
down to a single person

587
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
and so

588
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
let's take that and then just like you

589
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
brought up lee the implications of of

590
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
learn by doing is that we have to infer

591
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,679
by acting basically

592
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,120
so then what does it mean for the

593
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,799
scientist who's all in on that to be

594
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,840
studying

595
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
climate change on a coast or the

596
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
conservation of a forest or sociology or

597
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,400
anthropology

598
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
um

599
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,159
very interesting questions that i hope

600
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,559
um a lot of different listeners can

601
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,559
see resonating with their own situation

602
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
so stephen and then any other raised

603
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
hands

604
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
i think just also building on the idea

605
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
of this distributed input is and in many

606
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
cases it may end up

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
a lot of the may end up that a lot of

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
the work is not in science anymore it's

609
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
like science informed development or

610
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
science informed or even science

611
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,159
informing a model and the model informs

612
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
practices which inform

613
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
the way that communities can get

614
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,320
involved and now the real agent is

615
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
actually the community and we're serving

616
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
them so this interesting

617
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
shift between

618
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,559
where science fits in and

619
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
um can change you know i think that's

620
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
quite interesting as well yeah you know

621
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,400
i could have i could have titled the

622
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,559
entire series science influenced the

623
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
transformation because that is the

624
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
concept i was going for i called it

625
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
science driven but the the the

626
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,520
my

627
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
my idea there was was similar

628
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
and also the historical perspective

629
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,799
which includes many world knowledge

630
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
traditions and hundreds and thousands of

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
years and multiple continents not just

632
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
the story of western academia

633
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
understanding that that has not been a

634
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
steady state there's no stationarity

635
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
with peer review again mainstream

636
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
science especially the um second half of

637
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
the 1900s and further

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
that's new so science is in

639
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
transformation and has always been in

640
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
dialogue

641
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
from 10 000 years ago

642
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,799
so now given the agency that we have and

643
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
who we are and our affordances our

644
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
preferences what's the move so we don't

645
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
have any sort of a locked in phase to

646
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,159
resist against that's not to say there's

647
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,320
not inertia but it is to say that

648
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
there's actually a lot of agility in the

649
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
system the question is what are the

650
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
leverage points

651
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
where we can actually make that impact

652
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
and how my active inference come into

653
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
play

654
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,600
um you know maybe since we're on the

655
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,240
topic maybe we can just switch to us

656
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
jump ahead to just a little bit if i can

657
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,799
find it

658
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
or you find the slide and then lee go

659
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,918
for it

660
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,360
go ahead lee just to pick up on your um

661
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,480
your point there daniel really i mean um

662
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
i've kind of been hesitant to say it

663
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
uh in the actual inference kind of you

664
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
know discord server in the like but i

665
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
see such a huge amount of emphasis on

666
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,679
active influence as it means to um

667
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,159
you know to create ai and to improve ai

668
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
and i can't help i mean

669
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
i really spent thinking about how can

670
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
this knowledge be used to improve

671
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
you know our own individual cognition

672
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,279
and societal cognition human cognition

673
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
really well there doesn't seem to be um

674
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
i mean maybe i'm just missing some of

675
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
the literature on that so if there is

676
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,159
any you know point me towards it but

677
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,919
then it really seems to be that you know

678
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
like the whole big assumption is you

679
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,039
know we got to put this stuff in ai

680
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,520
because that's where all the progress is

681
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,559
going to be

682
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,240
et cetera et cetera and then i kind of

683
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,559
wonder is that really a wise goal

684
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,320
i don't know

685
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
i think active inference and several

686
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,400
other paths so not exclusive to active

687
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
inference it re-thinks artificial part

688
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
of artificial intelligence because it's

689
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,919
part of our extended niche and so yes

690
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,600
there's been a lot of focus on applying

691
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,080
active inference to machine learning

692
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
into reinforcement learning those types

693
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
of areas

694
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,600
and then what we're

695
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,279
talking towards here

696
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
is the integration of natural and

697
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,080
artificial intelligence under a broader

698
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
extended cognitive systems scope so

699
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
humans in the loop or real-time

700
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
computers just like every stoplight or

701
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
every bank transaction is going to be

702
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
every tweet is going to be

703
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
designing those interfaces

704
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
so that

705
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
within each blanket

706
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
there's functional cognition not viewed

707
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,440
only from the outside in but as part of

708
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
a broader system and maybe we find out

709
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,799
that we had good enough artificial

710
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
intelligence so-called algorithms in

711
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,760
2004

712
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,279
and that we just had to hook them up in

713
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,480
a different way

714
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
uh just like connecting different parts

715
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
of piping could give you an engine

716
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
that's more or less efficient maybe it

717
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,440
wasn't the case that we needed some sort

718
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
of scaling on a larger data set but we

719
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
needed a new way to combine sub

720
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
components which is what biology does as

721
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,559
well

722
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,200
so

723
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
[Music]

724
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
just a few more thoughts on that um

725
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
so

726
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,760
this the science world and and

727
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
particularly this this

728
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,000
cognitive cognitive framework or concept

729
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,200
of what is cognition i think can be

730
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
useful both at the societal level and at

731
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,640
the individual level i mean in the sense

732
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,159
that

733
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,279
if

734
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
science can help direct the attention of

735
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
the world to

736
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,480
to how how intelligence happens

737
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
all around us in nature all around us

738
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,919
every day

739
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,960
how you know how we evolve to

740
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,760
uh

741
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,039
to

742
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,640
you know

743
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,760
expand on the information process and

744
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
the information processing

745
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
the capacity for information processing

746
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,440
so

747
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
it helps it help in any you know it just

748
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,640
helps an individual to understand

749
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,840
a little better or have a different

750
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
perspective on

751
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,320
what am i doing what what is what am i

752
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,600
why am i here what am i doing why

753
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,480
why

754
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
am i

755
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,559
what am i

756
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,960
you know like to to a degree that these

757
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,120
this these new developments in cognitive

758
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
science can help to shed some light on

759
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
questions like that and at the same time

760
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,760
for a society like what are we doing

761
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
here together what what is our purpose

762
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,120
together

763
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
right and if you know your purpose

764
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,480
it's a lot easier to know where to go

765
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
next how to how to frame things in a way

766
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,480
that is

767
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
suitable for

768
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,559
your continued well-being

769
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
and it's a it's a bright line

770
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
in some senses between first and second

771
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,760
order science in the first order science

772
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
literature

773
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
there might be a lot of sort of

774
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,039
engineering type appeals to well we'll

775
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,799
make the society more efficient or

776
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
science and foreign policy will just

777
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
simply be better

778
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,200
and once we take that second order turn

779
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,559
we start to think

780
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
we're going to have increased clarity

781
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
about our values it's not going to be an

782
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,600
easy conversation we might need to

783
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,880
invent new ways of having the

784
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
conversation or formalizing our values

785
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,279
but we need some sort of path that's

786
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
going to bring us closer to clarity on

787
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
our values rather than obscuring it with

788
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
technical advances so stephen

789
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,640
john go ahead and then stephen i was

790
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
just going to say obscuring it with

791
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,000
technical

792
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,360
uh details but also obscuring it with

793
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,120
with

794
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,480
incompatibilities between what the

795
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
science world is saying and doing and

796
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
what say the governance world is saying

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,159
and doing or the economic world is

798
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
saying and doing obviously if all of

799
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
these systems are part of the cognitive

800
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,960
architecture you want them you want to

801
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,840
design them so that they are

802
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
integrated with each other so that the

803
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,039
signals

804
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,960
you know travel from one to the next

805
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
just as the signals in your body travel

806
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,240
from one

807
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,360
you know one system to the next system

808
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,080
yep stephen and i think this also ties

809
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,960
into

810
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
partly what this lab has been talking

811
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,360
about quite a lot in trying to enable

812
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,120
this possibility of making those

813
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,240
transitions without losing the rigor of

814
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
the modeling because the modeling is

815
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
seen as almost another way to get to

816
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
empirical data it's not just quite the

817
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,320
same as science but the challenge you

818
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
have as things unlike traditional

819
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
science going towards engineering you do

820
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,080
have this ability to embrace effects and

821
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,880
values but the challenge is how to stop

822
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
things getting

823
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
prematurely rarefied how it's so easy

824
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,960
things get rarified and suddenly

825
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,559
effectively you're just using another

826
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,200
word for system boundary and you're kind

827
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
of really doing the same paradigm work

828
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
with some different window dressing

829
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
right so it's really that's the

830
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,399
challenge i think to to and i don't

831
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,080
think anyone's quite managed to do that

832
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
yet but i think that's definitely

833
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,799
we're on the cusp this is this is

834
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,919
happening you know right now this this

835
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,360
struggle of

836
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,559
of what does it mean and how do we do it

837
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,039
and the premature ratification as you

838
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,480
said stephen

839
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,799
it's basically there's a a perfect

840
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,480
investing strategy you know if you had

841
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,399
the time machine you'd know exactly when

842
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,039
to buy the dip sell high

843
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,720
we don't have that we're moving forward

844
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
we don't have access to the future so

845
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
there's two kinds of confidence errors

846
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,480
there would be being overly confident so

847
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
too early

848
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,399
zoning in on a solution that's the

849
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,159
premature reification

850
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,240
and the other fallacy or the other side

851
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
of that perfect strategy

852
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,519
would be

853
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,039
waiting too long

854
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,519
and so somewhere between waiting too

855
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,200
long and acting too fast is

856
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,519
that trade-off space that we have from

857
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
so many different perspectives with not

858
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,559
just finding the value of explore versus

859
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,200
exploit that's gonna be best but

860
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,919
rethinking the explore and exploit

861
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,559
outcomes as part of a process that might

862
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,159
be doing something like balancing

863
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
epistemic and pragmatic value for

864
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
example in the free energy principle

865
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
so it's a really

866
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
awesome um conversation and john

867
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
continues

868
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
and altering how you measure fitness

869
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,200
relative to those two

870
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
those two

871
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
differences

872
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,080
well since we've been talking talking

873
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
about science the role of science in

874
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,080
this why don't we jump ahead to slide

875
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,960
two

876
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,559
uh or uh

877
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
germ board two slide sixteen if you

878
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
would yep

879
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,039
and while you oh okay that was fast and

880
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,000
uh well uh we get that rolling uh just

881
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,320
one more thought on second order versus

882
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
first order science

883
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
you know fizzy's paper is great really i

884
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
think an important one

885
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
but

886
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,840
it's nude i mean that's it's new to the

887
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,919
science world most of the science world

888
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,919
is very focused on what we would call

889
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,240
first order science where the scientist

890
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
is a part is is a is an observer of a

891
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,679
system not engaged with

892
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,600
transformation of that system or

893
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
achieving value driven goals in that

894
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
system

895
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,919
and uh first order science is fantastic

896
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
you know we learn we have learned a

897
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,399
tremendous amount of knowledge gained a

898
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,919
tremendous amount of knowledge from

899
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,000
first order science so

900
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,279
it is it is fantastic for what it is and

901
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,760
you know has to be continued uh

902
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,679
but in addition to that we can also

903
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,320
start to be thinking about what is

904
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,120
second order science how how can the

905
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
science world be engaged in a

906
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
value-driven effort towards

907
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,039
some better future

908
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,000
and uh i suspect that there are lots of

909
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,640
scientists who are frustrated

910
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
who are frustrated because they don't

911
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
know how to there's not an avenue for

912
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,000
them to participate in

913
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,200
in really jumping in to make this world

914
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
a better place

915
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,799
intelligent people look at our world and

916
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,600
they see the enormous stress that we're

917
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,080
under in this moment and

918
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,679
are fearful of the of the even larger

919
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,399
stress that's a that is likely about to

920
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,600
be flawless

921
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,240
so i i think that there might be a

922
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,880
tremendous amount of frustration in the

923
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
science world of how do we how do we

924
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
use our capacities

925
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
to actually

926
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,720
fundamentally make things better

927
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,039
as opposed to just passing off of you

928
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,720
know them you know

929
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,679
sort of

930
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,600
little trivializing it a bit here but

931
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,360
just passing off a recommendation to

932
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,279
some policy makers who then do whatever

933
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,960
they do and you know

934
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,559
the scientist is then out of the loop

935
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,440
so

936
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,119
i i i think that this is the time

937
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,839
for

938
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,839
second order science to flourish this is

939
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
the this is the opportunity for the

940
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
science community to really get engaged

941
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,199
in these

942
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,520
deep and important problems that

943
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,599
civilization faces right now

944
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,440
and in the in the in the series i'm i'm

945
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,480
trying to propose an r d program that

946
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,960
is a path for the science world to get

947
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
involved in these in these deeper

948
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,280
questions

949
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
and have an impact a deeper impact on

950
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,040
civilization

951
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
so this uh this slide is a is kind of a

952
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,079
summary of uh from my paper of of why

953
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,679
should science

954
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,599
you know why should science care about

955
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,000
this and why should science get involved

956
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
and we can just we can talk about any

957
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,200
number of these but i'll just sort of

958
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
jump through a little bit just to

959
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,079
highlight a few ideas

960
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,320
the very first one is just this idea of

961
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
societal cognition that's that's

962
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,320
you know that's kind of new that's

963
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,119
that's uh there's there's great

964
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,839
potential for scientific discovery just

965
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
on that question of how what does a

966
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,800
society cognate how does it cognate uh

967
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
in you know in what ways by what

968
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,119
mechanisms by what features

969
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
and what with what characteristics i

970
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
mean there's you know just as far as

971
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
expanding the level of knowledge this

972
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,200
question is really interesting

973
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,799
um a second one

974
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
so

975
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,880
we're talking about designing societal

976
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,839
systems and obviously this is a really

977
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,200
complex

978
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,920
issue these are not this is not a simple

979
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,000
how do you build a better can opener

980
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
right this is a this is difficult and

981
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,079
complex issues and the science world has

982
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,760
has skills that can be really useful in

983
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
in addressing these questions and

984
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,720
framing the framing the movement towards

985
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,680
how do we how do we start how do we test

986
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,599
what are the how do we measure fitness

987
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,079
how do we

988
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
what is the goal what is the purpose

989
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,599
what are we doing you know like the

990
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,480
science world would have a lot to say

991
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,359
about uh framing this entire

992
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,040
question of what is societal

993
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
transformation and how would we move how

994
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,920
would we move forward with it

995
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,839
i might add too

996
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,440
to this that

997
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
um

998
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
as i see it at least one of the benefits

999
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,000
of having the science world involved in

1000
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,400
this question of societal transformation

1001
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,960
is that the science world can provide

1002
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
kind of object sort of objective and

1003
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,280
consistent

1004
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,320
metrics and frameworks to help guide the

1005
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
process

1006
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
that is

1007
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,480
turned around uh if

1008
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,359
if this if this if this process of

1009
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,200
societal transformation this program of

1010
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
societal transformation

1011
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
was merely

1012
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,400
based on

1013
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,880
what a group

1014
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,240
uh like you know the the

1015
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,580
um

1016
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,680
[Music]

1017
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,720
this group votes for this let's do this

1018
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
and this other group votes for let's do

1019
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
this and it was just it was just a

1020
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
popularity contest of whatever was most

1021
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,440
popular in the moment that's where

1022
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,119
that's where that's where the

1023
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
transformation is going i don't think

1024
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,640
the science world would have any much

1025
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,160
interest in that like

1026
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,680
popularity contests or that kind of uh

1027
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,520
that kind of effort that where's the sun

1028
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
you know where's the knowledge and that

1029
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
where's the science

1030
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,760
it would be on the other hand i think it

1031
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
would be very interesting to the science

1032
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,000
world if transformation was based on

1033
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
some kind of principled approach some

1034
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,040
kind of

1035
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
some kind like we can agree uh to

1036
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,040
to an extent at least we can agree what

1037
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,839
fitness might mean for society

1038
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
and some of that would be based on

1039
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
objective measures some of it might be

1040
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,359
based on subjective measures but

1041
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,839
intelligent people can get together and

1042
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,280
and conceptualize what fitness for a

1043
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
society or for a societal system might

1044
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,599
look like you know these are of course

1045
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,160
complicated problems deep problems

1046
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,200
but if we could do that as a community

1047
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,000
if we could if we could

1048
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
find some way to assess fitness in a

1049
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,079
reasonable reasonable way a reasonably

1050
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
coherent way a reasonably consistent way

1051
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,880
then

1052
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
then we have a path to to move forward

1053
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
of you know different different groups

1054
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,839
could try different ways to reach a high

1055
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,000
fitness and all of those experiments

1056
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
would be adding to the body of knowledge

1057
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,880
of how do we do this so that fitness

1058
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
improves right

1059
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,119
i don't mean to to say that that coming

1060
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,720
up with fitness scores and fitness

1061
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,680
evaluations of new systems would be easy

1062
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,000
but it isn't it is a topic that we can

1063
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
tackle and it's because

1064
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,839
that because of

1065
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
our capacity to

1066
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
conceptualize fitness and and

1067
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,880
formalize fitness in the sense of a

1068
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,440
formal assessment i think that makes the

1069
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,359
whole proc i'm hoping that makes the

1070
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,680
whole project interesting to the science

1071
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
world because now we're now this is

1072
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
science now this now this is expanding

1073
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,400
knowledge this is using uh first

1074
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
principles and you know scientific

1075
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,440
principles to evaluate systems and and

1076
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,079
it's not a popularity contest it's not

1077
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,320
uh you know this is this is adding to

1078
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,599
our understanding of of of how the world

1079
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,880
works and how

1080
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,359
intelligence works and how cognition

1081
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,520
works you know and expanding it out to

1082
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
the societal level

1083
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
thanks i don't know i mean maybe there's

1084
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,119
some thoughts on that alone but

1085
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,800
yep stephen and then anyone else who

1086
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,839
raises their hands

1087
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,160
yeah just sort of a couple of questions

1088
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,240
around that the idea of fitness

1089
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,200
landscapes and how that might be used is

1090
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
i sense you're you're sort of proposing

1091
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,800
that you could use these kind of fitness

1092
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,319
landscape i suppose you could even have

1093
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,119
descent on free energy landscapes

1094
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,160
to try and help inform

1095
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,640
policy selection i.e maybe which

1096
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,200
research streams you're going to go down

1097
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,760
um because at the moment you know we're

1098
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,720
kind of

1099
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,800
either tied into

1100
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,960
what the market says

1101
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,839
or some other methods but this could

1102
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,240
because this fitness maybe you could

1103
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,359
separate out because i could see a

1104
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,480
couple of different

1105
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,319
ways you could look at that then is it

1106
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,560
like an extra field of practice to

1107
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,440
inform choosing the policy of which

1108
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,119
research field to go down and which

1109
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,319
avenues or is it also within the field

1110
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,240
is it with the fields connecting to each

1111
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,040
other i just wondered how that might be

1112
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
you know it's all of those because

1113
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,800
because everything that we do ought to

1114
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,359
be serving our purpose you know i mean i

1115
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,680
don't obviously there's great room for

1116
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,400
play and you know and exploration and

1117
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
all that kind of stuff i don't mean to

1118
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,480
to uh to

1119
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,119
make humans uh you know

1120
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,880
two-dimensional or something

1121
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
humans are complex organisms they have

1122
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,319
complex needs and all of those needs

1123
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,119
must be addressed right

1124
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,400
but

1125
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
but the fitness i s the concept of

1126
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
fitness

1127
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,240
i see that

1128
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,920
i see that as permeating multiple levels

1129
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,400
right because because yes we would want

1130
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,839
to choose policies that help us and then

1131
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,000
and then what does help mean what does

1132
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,079
it mean how does it look if it helps us

1133
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,400
what is what is that all about right so

1134
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,720
in some sense if we just say i want to

1135
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
help we're already thinking i want to

1136
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,920
improve fitness somehow right

1137
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,319
but not just policy

1138
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,000
but even structural design of what how

1139
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
what is a system what what what how do

1140
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,839
how does society make decisions how do

1141
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,839
we communicate what is our communication

1142
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,880
systems how do we get input from

1143
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,280
everyone into this process of decision

1144
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
making you know

1145
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,359
like like so across the board both in

1146
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,400
the structural design of systems

1147
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,160
and institutions

1148
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,280
and uh

1149
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,000
and

1150
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,079
even to some degree um

1151
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,960
uh uh

1152
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
social norms right through education

1153
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
systems like what kinds of social norms

1154
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,760
help us

1155
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,040
um and then obviously too than in policy

1156
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,960
but then even in our individual lives

1157
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,040
like it helps i think it might help

1158
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,520
individuals to understand that

1159
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,319
that

1160
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,680
what we want is uh improved quality of

1161
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,920
life lower uncertainty how can i make

1162
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
decisions in my own life

1163
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,319
that bring me the things that i that i

1164
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
think might actually make me feel better

1165
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
that actually might serve me

1166
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,200
uh on a on a

1167
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,160
even a superficial and deep level right

1168
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,720
thanks john uh lee and then stephen

1169
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,640
yeah uh just some um thoughts on on the

1170
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,079
the fitness

1171
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,040
metrics really so um and this kind of

1172
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,520
goes to the

1173
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
go to the point about the way that

1174
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,319
scientists need to engage with local

1175
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,920
communities because there's quite a lot

1176
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,000
of work that's already starting in in

1177
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,640
that area and a lot of it is um

1178
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,880
it's based around this idea of place

1179
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,760
so

1180
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,359
scale has already been taken into

1181
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,680
account and this this whole kind of

1182
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
sense of the emerging bioregional

1183
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,680
movement which just essentially means

1184
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,520
you know aligning your political and

1185
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,720
governance boundaries with the

1186
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,119
boundaries of ecosystems

1187
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,240
um

1188
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,200
and that then naturally has the effect

1189
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
of it

1190
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,480
it partitions things in a way that's

1191
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,800
meaningful to to local people

1192
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,319
um and then you can start to ask them

1193
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,880
you know like what is it that they value

1194
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,240
within their place because they're

1195
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,839
already kind of connected to it in a way

1196
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,079
um uh and i mean

1197
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,920
i suppose one thing for me is this idea

1198
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,480
of metrics really versus counter factual

1199
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,920
simulation because once you start

1200
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,680
putting a metric on something you know

1201
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,839
like you have a number and then you know

1202
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,880
that's something that people can't

1203
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
really care about whereas you know like

1204
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,640
if they can imagine how their you know

1205
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
their local river system for example uh

1206
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
wouldn't be polluted by you know sewage

1207
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,839
being released from the sewage works or

1208
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,440
you know run off from them you know and

1209
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,359
they could see you know that then has

1210
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,520
this sort of the effect of um

1211
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,400
you know of engaging people i think

1212
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,960
more in in the

1213
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
uh in the actions that we would need to

1214
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,319
collaboratively take to make these kind

1215
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,960
of things happen sure sure other

1216
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,319
different people might react in

1217
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,920
different ways to some people might be

1218
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,640
more you know

1219
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
really appreciate the modeling aspect

1220
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,640
other people might just appreciate the

1221
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
boots on the ground

1222
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,400
local change aspect but i would say

1223
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,480
there's room for all of that and uh the

1224
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,160
bio regionalism

1225
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,240
concepts are great i've been a fan for a

1226
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,640
long time and who knows maybe in the

1227
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
future we'll move more and more towards

1228
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,560
that so that communities are really

1229
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,599
localized in their environment and

1230
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
and protecting their environment and all

1231
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,880
that kind of stuff

1232
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
that's great in in some ways in some

1233
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
ways science has to catch up with

1234
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,359
communities of change who have been

1235
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,040
working on this for a long time these

1236
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,200
these concepts and in other ways science

1237
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
is already you know

1238
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,920
pulling pulling communities

1239
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,160
you know helping to save more there's

1240
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,680
more there's more there's more we can do

1241
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,200
there's a bigger picture we can serve

1242
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,480
here

1243
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
so it's a it'll be a give and take i

1244
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,640
think between communities and

1245
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,240
there's one more thing is the

1246
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,800
bioregionalism idea is great and a lot

1247
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,440
of work also has been done uh in

1248
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
alternatives to gdp

1249
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,359
so you know the metrics that are that

1250
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,119
people are talking about about you know

1251
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,359
considering education and longevity and

1252
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,280
disease and all these other things as

1253
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,599
as opposed to just a single gdp measure

1254
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,640
of

1255
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,960
societal quality

1256
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
so there's lots of work being done on

1257
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,400
multiple fields

1258
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,160
and to speak to the metrics from an

1259
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,240
active inference perspective

1260
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,160
let's just say that we wanted a river

1261
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,599
that was

1262
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
uh unpolluted we wanted no toxins in the

1263
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,760
river so our preference in the active

1264
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
inference model would be that the river

1265
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,680
is clean that'd be in our preference

1266
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,839
vector now traditional reinforcement

1267
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,760
learning would look at the level and it

1268
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
would reinforce policies that reduce

1269
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,839
pollution locally and then it would

1270
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,319
forget policies that didn't locally

1271
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,680
now the question is let's just say you

1272
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
start decreasing it and all of a sudden

1273
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,440
it starts creeping back up your

1274
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
reinforcement learner is going to be

1275
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,560
quite confused so an active inference

1276
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,880
we can say that our metric

1277
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
is actually our uncertainty around our

1278
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,119
generative model of the river's

1279
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,280
pollution so then

1280
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,839
what actions can we take if our

1281
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,400
uncertainty starts to get wider

1282
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,720
how can we increase our precision

1283
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,040
on our generative model of pollution and

1284
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,119
then of course concordantly with our

1285
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,680
values that it be unpolluted how can we

1286
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,640
act to reduce our uncertainty

1287
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,280
and so it's the reinforcement economic

1288
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,839
maximization mindset pick the metric i

1289
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,240
want everyone to read that's the metric

1290
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,760
reading well no

1291
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,839
the preference is that everyone can read

1292
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,400
but the metric in active inference is

1293
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,319
our uncertainty around our observations

1294
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,160
and it's an extremely

1295
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,880
subtle at first but eventually very

1296
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
far-reaching way to think about these

1297
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
systems and what fitness is because a

1298
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,040
lot of times fitness metrics people are

1299
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,920
going to be thinking right like gdp or

1300
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,079
write like something that we want to see

1301
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,640
but we can actually now tease apart

1302
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,000
our preferences

1303
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,839
from our affordances from our

1304
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,839
uncertainty in our generative model and

1305
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
several other features of active

1306
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,000
inference scale-free models and that is

1307
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,079
going to help us have a

1308
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,200
multi-stakeholder conversation in a new

1309
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,920
way that's great great great great great

1310
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,760
great great thank you um

1311
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,400
yeah i just add to that i totally i

1312
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,960
totally agree with what

1313
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,079
daniel just mentioned there because

1314
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,520
it's not almost it's not an active

1315
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,000
inference per se on its own but it's the

1316
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,960
ability of active inference to be used

1317
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,359
in this epistemic foraging way

1318
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,680
and i think the point that was made

1319
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,280
there about reinforcement learning which

1320
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,440
we kind of think oh that's some machine

1321
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,960
learning method but actually

1322
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,520
reinforcement learning is the dominant

1323
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,599
approach to development

1324
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,400
it's like it's the way humans have

1325
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,880
structured in a way their own thinking

1326
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,119
it's not exactly reinforcement learning

1327
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,760
such a bit but it's it's so constrained

1328
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,040
and it's so goal driven um and the only

1329
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,440
integrating way to overcome it and why

1330
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,280
thatcher then started saying there is no

1331
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,760
alternative is the market saying it

1332
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
can't deal with the complexity beyond a

1333
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
certain point so you have to offload it

1334
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,119
to this market which again you get into

1335
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,240
that kind of

1336
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
just becomes whatever's the favorite of

1337
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,280
the day

1338
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,079
and

1339
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
this gives us a way to get into this

1340
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,800
nuanced complexity it gives us at least

1341
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,119
the chance to go somewhere other routes

1342
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,920
and plausibly deliver on that promise

1343
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,480
you know i think that's really cool it's

1344
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,160
right absolutely

1345
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,720
to give like a spatial metaphor on

1346
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,599
reinforcement learning versus active

1347
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,640
inference it's like if there's a

1348
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,240
mountain peak that we know that we want

1349
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,319
to get to the reinforcement learner

1350
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,640
would say okay the goal and the reward

1351
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
is the elevation and so it can get

1352
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,359
trapped on a local elevation peak but

1353
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,200
then it might not take a step backwards

1354
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,400
or down a few to get to the highest peak

1355
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,359
but again if we do a trajectory of

1356
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,960
policy inference

1357
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,960
on getting to the top of a mountain

1358
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,359
again of course as a preference that we

1359
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,839
have for ourselves in the future we can

1360
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,319
ask am i reducing my uncertainty about

1361
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,680
how i'm going to get there when i'm

1362
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,040
going to get there and the way that

1363
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,119
we're going to do it together

1364
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,839
with potentially a group of hikers who

1365
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,920
have different capacities

1366
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,760
instead of how are we going to get to

1367
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,079
the top of a little null and then just

1368
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,480
stake out so it's a different

1369
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,960
conversation style steven yeah than

1370
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,520
anyone else yeah and so building on that

1371
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,559
is when you have that come into play

1372
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,520
is the ability for the active inference

1373
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
approaches like you're talking about

1374
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,319
is

1375
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,319
magnified greatly when you don't just

1376
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,319
focus on the one person or the two

1377
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,079
people who are like the agents of change

1378
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,760
but you say well what about the local

1379
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,160
people who have no idea about the goal

1380
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,839
they have no ability to elevate they

1381
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,520
have no ability to contribute to the

1382
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,440
reinforcement learning but they know the

1383
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,079
slopes they can tell me the history they

1384
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,760
can tell me where people fell to their

1385
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,680
death in the past or

1386
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,800
where there's

1387
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,640
you know all these and that then makes

1388
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,880
the place made place-based

1389
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,240
community-based contributions much more

1390
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,920
plausible um as why they they enable the

1391
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,559
scientists and other people to

1392
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,079
do exactly what you're talking about

1393
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,119
yeah

1394
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,920
excellent uh just uh just to point out

1395
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,119
um

1396
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,200
so we're talking about reducing expected

1397
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,680
uncertainty about the future right

1398
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,559
think of all the ways that that

1399
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,119
think of all the implications of that in

1400
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,040
say

1401
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,160
you know

1402
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,000
design of systems or design of

1403
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,880
institutions or actions of humans you

1404
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,720
know facing some problem

1405
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,559
right so we so one question that

1406
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,480
immediately arises is do we have enough

1407
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,400
information are we collecting the right

1408
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,040
information at the right frequency to

1409
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,960
even understand what's going on or to

1410
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,839
reduce our uncertainty second is how

1411
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,920
good are we at anticipating the future

1412
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,119
are we do

1413
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,280
can can we do that with some accuracy do

1414
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,720
we know what's going to happen next we

1415
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,000
have any idea what's going to happen

1416
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,359
next how good or how good are our are

1417
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,839
how good are our worldview concepts that

1418
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,160
lead to anticipation of the future and

1419
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,599
how good are our

1420
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,440
you know computational models about

1421
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,480
what's going to happen next

1422
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,680
how good is our information information

1423
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,599
sharing capacities how are we

1424
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,359
communicating with each other are we

1425
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,920
communicating the information between

1426
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,160
groups and between individuals such that

1427
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,480
we can understand what's going to happen

1428
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,319
next and understand what our uncertainty

1429
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,440
levels are

1430
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,319
uh

1431
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,319
you know like i can go on but there's

1432
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,800
like this it seems like a simple

1433
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,880
proposition at first and then you

1434
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,440
realize that proposition has enormous

1435
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,400
depth

1436
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,040
it implies all kinds of things about how

1437
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,359
a society might function and organize

1438
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,280
itself

1439
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,520
one one thought on the wisdom of crowds

1440
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,599
and distributed computation there's a

1441
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,440
famous example from early in

1442
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,680
quantitative genetics where it was at a

1443
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,000
world's fair and a crowd was asked you

1444
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,599
know you put in a raffle ticket you can

1445
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,119
predict how much some

1446
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,359
cow uh weighs

1447
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,000
and then the average of the estimates

1448
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,680
was extremely accurate

1449
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,760
although many individuals were of course

1450
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,359
distantly off the mark

1451
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,000
and a lot of people take that just um

1452
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,920
straightforwardly as

1453
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,680
existence of the wisdom of crowds but

1454
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,520
there's a few pieces of that scenario

1455
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
that really matter the first is that the

1456
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,599
people attending may have had experience

1457
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,040
they may have been working in

1458
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,640
agricultural settings or have experience

1459
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,760
with getting feedback on their

1460
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,599
predictions and secondly the estimate

1461
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,520
was a bit bounded it wasn't that the cow

1462
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,680
was one pound or ten thousand pounds

1463
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,800
there was a an estimator and then it was

1464
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,960
still a cognitive diversity that

1465
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,800
contributed to that estimate so you

1466
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,839
couldn't just look at somebody who

1467
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,599
overestimates that well get rid of that

1468
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,359
guy he's wrong he's like that's

1469
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,520
counterbalanced by someone on the other

1470
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,680
side of that curve that's how we're

1471
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,760
getting an estimate so

1472
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,839
having a distributional and a community

1473
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,480
perspective on decision making helps us

1474
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,319
recognize and encourage and foster

1475
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,000
diversity of opinion

1476
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,520
and also structure a resilient community

1477
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
so it's something that will be really

1478
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,160
interesting to see how and where

1479
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,960
these kinds of memes and ideas pop up

1480
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,480
yeah absolutely um

1481
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,680
valuing differences of opinion valuing

1482
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,000
differences of perspective is one one

1483
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,160
thing that you had said there i just

1484
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,640
added just add something to that is

1485
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,920
uh in our polarized society today we we

1486
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
you know there's like liberals and

1487
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,359
there's conservatives at least in the

1488
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,119
u.s

1489
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,960
and uh

1490
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,480
they seem to be in two different

1491
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,599
universes almost right but

1492
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,000
liberal and conservative

1493
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,839
at their best

1494
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,599
is a little bit like

1495
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,160
exploration versus exploitation you know

1496
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,640
the the necessary balance for any

1497
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,400
organism or for any decision-making

1498
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,880
process to balance exploration of the

1499
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,200
unknown and exploitation of what is

1500
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,119
already known what is traditional what

1501
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,119
what is our history what what do we know

1502
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,160
works

1503
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,160
uh you know like at their best liberal

1504
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,319
and conservatives are both important

1505
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,960
just as exploration and exploitation are

1506
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,040
both important and problem solving

1507
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
and they're relative just like left and

1508
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,319
right

1509
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,839
when you're spinning around and things

1510
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,040
are changing

1511
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,480
it's hard to say and that's why we can

1512
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,680
pull back

1513
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,599
to some real pillars

1514
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,040
of biological systems instead of trying

1515
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,359
to scaffold further and further into the

1516
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,160
political or logistical ether

1517
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,440
we can actually

1518
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,400
return to our grounding as a biological

1519
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,119
society so lee i saw

1520
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,720
your hand raised or maybe i didn't or

1521
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,720
stephen oh yeah stephen and then anyone

1522
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,280
else who raised their hands

1523
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,799
that was quite interesting we made that

1524
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,520
point though about you know we'd look to

1525
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,440
explore the unknown

1526
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,799
and i think that in addition to that

1527
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,200
um because that's from the perspective

1528
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,680
of say the scientist or the person in

1529
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,040
the kind of

1530
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,319
the knowledge

1531
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,359
um generating game so to speak that's

1532
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,359
their profession or whatever

1533
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,319
but there's also that exploring

1534
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,640
the known but not knowing that it's

1535
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,040
known the tacit the so this is where

1536
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,280
communities can come in is like there's

1537
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,599
there's like they i

1538
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,799
realizing that some of that unknown is

1539
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,520
participants in those environments

1540
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
no

1541
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,160
it just needs to be surfaced this is

1542
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,200
where some of the work with the

1543
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,520
environment side of the active inference

1544
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,000
the niche and these topographies that

1545
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
i'm quite interested in my side can come

1546
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,079
in because now they're exploring and

1547
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,599
revealing stuff

1548
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,400
and

1549
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,559
in a way which is networked and sort of

1550
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,440
not just isolated as single stories or

1551
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,400
experiences and fragmented so i i think

1552
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
that connects with what you're saying

1553
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,000
can you give one example of what you're

1554
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,960
thinking

1555
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,880
so one example we did a project around

1556
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,359
water issues in rural

1557
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,520
areas of northern maputo land in in

1558
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
south africa and

1559
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,480
so they had different areas of water

1560
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,160
catchment so some people were getting

1561
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,280
water from a lake but the lake had

1562
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,920
hippos and you know crocodiles so it was

1563
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,839
a bit challenging for them in different

1564
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,160
ways and um so you've got these

1565
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,480
different water catchment areas and it's

1566
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,440
like

1567
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,920
they had the lived experience of having

1568
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,440
to go there having to get the water

1569
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,599
having to boil it because if the water's

1570
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,359
contaminated you've got to boil it and

1571
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,520
there's other um what it means then if

1572
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,640
you're then doing that if you've got

1573
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,480
someone at home who's got hiv

1574
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,640
on top of that so then you know so they

1575
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,040
can't walk or they've got to have so all

1576
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,559
these questions so what they would do is

1577
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,160
they would create a fabric map the size

1578
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,359
of the room about all their different

1579
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,119
routes to water and then share the

1580
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,880
stories from eight different or whatever

1581
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,960
numbers of hot spots and then that

1582
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,599
became the sort of landscape so in doing

1583
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,359
so that that wasn't given the answers

1584
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,000
but it was informing another process

1585
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,559
maybe a week later which was looking for

1586
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,960
innovations looking for options for new

1587
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,839
approaches so that's one type of

1588
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,160
way that you could like reveal something

1589
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,520
from the local landscape which would

1590
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,760
never have been available to an engineer

1591
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,599
from their own knowledge yeah great

1592
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,119
stuff great stuff

1593
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,200
um so some of what you're talking about

1594
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,359
is what is our narrative what is our

1595
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,359
individual narrative and what is our

1596
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,040
shared narrative

1597
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,599
right like what what is our life what is

1598
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,760
our experience of life and what does

1599
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,799
what do i as an individual have what

1600
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,240
what

1601
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,440
knowledge and lived experience can i

1602
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,400
offer to this group that would help the

1603
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,640
group to eventually function better or

1604
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
make better decisions right

1605
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,280
so

1606
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,040
that's a really interesting question to

1607
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,640
me

1608
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,920
for many reasons but one reason is

1609
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,280
how

1610
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,720
how

1611
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,640
suppose we were to move forward with

1612
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
this this whole project was moving

1613
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,559
forward

1614
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,799
how do we communicate with each other

1615
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,520
richly how what the i would i would

1616
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
argue that there is no system no

1617
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,599
functional system right now

1618
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,799
that a million people or 10 000 people

1619
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,200
can richly communicate their lived

1620
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,400
experience their their understanding of

1621
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
life their understanding of how what

1622
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,079
might happen if a b and c happen

1623
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,760
i don't think we have

1624
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,319
we're in need of tools to richly

1625
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,839
communicate uh uh our you know

1626
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,119
and

1627
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,520
i mean we're needed tools yeah

1628
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,480
so that's a immediate opportunity for

1629
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
groups to get involved with is just at

1630
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,440
just that little question of how would

1631
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,760
we communicate and how would we how

1632
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,720
would we

1633
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,720
how would we make decisions together in

1634
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,559
some kind of collaborative fashion

1635
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,880
probably how do 10 000 people do that

1636
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,319
once or a million people when you can't

1637
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,760
all fit in a room

1638
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,960
you know that's the question when you

1639
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,640
can't all fit in a room to really

1640
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,400
thoroughly discuss these issues and

1641
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,480
listen to each other how do we do that

1642
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,040
at scale

1643
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,720
right so that is

1644
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,680
and

1645
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,119
i think there could be answers to that

1646
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,200
that's not an impossible task that's a

1647
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,839
really uh interesting and

1648
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,920
doable task if we just put our minds to

1649
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,960
it

1650
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,920
it's but okay let's relate to regimes of

1651
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,920
attention and active inference

1652
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,000
perspectives on narratives which were

1653
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,920
even our first active livestream number

1654
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,280
one was on narrative active inference

1655
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,640
because we think it's

1656
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,720
crucial and if there's going to be a

1657
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,559
social narrative like you had brought up

1658
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,040
well that's something that is not just

1659
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,520
sharded into a person's brain it's not a

1660
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,960
holograph where it's the same in the

1661
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,480
person's brain as it is at the social

1662
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,400
level things that brains know that

1663
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,640
neurons don't it's not like each neuron

1664
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,559
is holding a little mini brain

1665
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,720
it's actually that there is differences

1666
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,400
amongst neurons or if you think about

1667
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,960
like star wars or movie it's like each

1668
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,079
character

1669
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,040
doesn't know the whole omniscient scope

1670
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,599
and so we're part of a bigger story

1671
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,839
and so it's going to be

1672
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,319
interesting to explore what will it feel

1673
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,000
like as a person and what will it be

1674
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,240
like experientially

1675
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,000
with a personal narrative to be part of

1676
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,640
a broader societal narrative but those

1677
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,720
will not be the same thing

1678
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,720
and the desire for those to be the same

1679
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,359
thing will lead to system fragility in

1680
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,559
many cases

1681
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,680
so stephen and then any other comments

1682
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,319
yeah i think that that that ability to

1683
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,319
know certain things is is a very

1684
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,079
important point and i think in active

1685
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,200
inference something that i've

1686
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,280
increasingly been looking at

1687
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,319
is

1688
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,480
we've got external states and we've got

1689
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,680
hidden states okay in different ways so

1690
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,559
there's

1691
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,160
from the perspective of the generative

1692
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,559
model of a say a water engineer there

1693
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,880
will be more like there's hidden states

1694
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,480
from everything right from everyone to

1695
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,319
some extent okay as well as states that

1696
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,000
we can engage in

1697
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,680
um and

1698
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,880
so there will be this question about how

1699
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,240
do you engage the hidden states

1700
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,480
in a landscape as well as the

1701
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,720
external states of the regime of

1702
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,280
attention and where can someone else

1703
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,839
who's got a different lived experience

1704
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,480
contribute to

1705
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,559
opening up and maybe telling us where

1706
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,720
they think the meaningful

1707
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,440
aspects of their landscape are so that i

1708
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,079
think that as well as modeling happening

1709
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,280
from

1710
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,039
our own computational models and being

1711
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,680
able to maybe use some tools that we can

1712
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,039
model through

1713
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,119
participation in placements place

1714
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,400
basically

1715
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,119
absolutely absolutely so so this tool i

1716
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,319
have in mind

1717
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,119
it's uh it's

1718
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,920
i want to have my voice heard i i have a

1719
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,319
story that is that could be important to

1720
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,680
others that could be important to any

1721
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,599
particular situation that

1722
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,359
or topic that society is trying to

1723
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,039
decide upon and i would very much like

1724
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,039
my voice to be heard and not just a yes

1725
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,160
or no or not just to choose a b or c

1726
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,160
way i would i have a rich experience

1727
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,760
that i want to communicate

1728
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,720
now

1729
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,960
you know i another person sitting next

1730
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,720
to me might have a model of water

1731
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,559
quality or whatever the issue is and

1732
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,480
they might have something to say about

1733
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,839
what their model

1734
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:06,880
implies

1735
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,200
but all of those voices right should be

1736
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,119
heard all of those voices should be part

1737
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,039
of the cognitive process of a society so

1738
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,839
so certainly data driven in you know

1739
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,079
model formal models of this and that

1740
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,000
sure that's great that's fantastic it's

1741
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,480
an extension of our cognitive capacity

1742
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,319
and at the same time

1743
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,359
i'm

1744
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,559
intelligent

1745
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,880
and i'm you know i can do things a

1746
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,079
computer can't

1747
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,680
at least today you know i can do many

1748
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,280
things a computer can't

1749
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,280
so whatever process whatever

1750
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,440
communication system and process that

1751
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,760
develops out of this ought to be one

1752
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,160
where every voice can be heard can be

1753
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,839
registered can be incorporated into

1754
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,359
this larger

1755
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,039
really cognitive process you're talking

1756
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,720
about you know it's like sharing and

1757
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,799
we're discussing but that's a cognitive

1758
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,799
process right for a group because it's

1759
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,240
leading towards some better

1760
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,079
understanding of the world

1761
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,119
and you know improved decision making

1762
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,559
about the world

1763
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,960
john if i could uh you mentioned data

1764
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,839
driven

1765
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,880
so to again sort of distinguish and

1766
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,200
contrast with how you're potentially

1767
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,520
using data driven versus how it might be

1768
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,599
uh implicitly used in other settings

1769
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,400
data driven who's being driven us the

1770
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,480
data are driving us and our policy oh

1771
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,319
the policy is going to be data driven

1772
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,799
okay well how about it's human driven

1773
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,799
how about the policy and our affordances

1774
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,880
and the data are like a car and we're

1775
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,280
driving the car do we need a better car

1776
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,520
does it have too many wheels where are

1777
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,400
we driving who whose turn is it to drive

1778
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,079
how are we choosing which music is being

1779
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,880
played in our human driven car

1780
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,680
not

1781
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,520
how are we going to fit into a

1782
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,599
data-driven human

1783
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,760
mode and it's just interesting that

1784
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,160
sometimes what is left unsaid

1785
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,559
or unstated is where a lot of those

1786
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,440
values get swept under the rug it's data

1787
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,640
driven what else do you want to talk

1788
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,400
about oh values okay well there's time

1789
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,240
for values it's like there has to be

1790
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
time for values but the data-driven

1791
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,680
conversation makes it sound like it's

1792
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,280
the beginning and the end

1793
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,680
right right today yes yes and i think

1794
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,319
that can be expanded greatly

1795
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,839
um

1796
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,920
right so that's that's when i use the

1797
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,480
word richness that's a little bit of

1798
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,799
what i'm trying to imply is the richness

1799
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:23,359
of experience the richness of

1800
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,160
perspectives the richness of of past

1801
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,079
information that cannot that i as an

1802
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,319
individual can bring to bear on this

1803
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:31,920
issue whatever the issue is and then on

1804
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,799
top of that what what does the data what

1805
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,559
data do we have how frequent how

1806
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,720
frequently do we collect it how what is

1807
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,720
its quality how can it contribute to

1808
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,079
this discussion

1809
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,160
right so very much

1810
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,039
this

1811
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,280
it's not that the computer has to decide

1812
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,119
what to do it's that human beings have

1813
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,920
to decide you know what to do how to

1814
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,160
given all this information what do we do

1815
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,400
how do we frame this how do we frame our

1816
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,799
problem how do we are we even looking at

1817
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,119
the right problem are we look are we is

1818
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,680
our focus too narrow are we you know or

1819
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,680
do we need to broaden our focus to

1820
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,359
understand better how all of these

1821
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,640
different problems

1822
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,200
so very much human and the human in the

1823
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,319
center

1824
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,920
computation

1825
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,640
and to connect that to first and higher

1826
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,400
order science and i'd be curious what

1827
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,319
you think the first order project is

1828
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,640
like build a bridge the second order

1829
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,160
project is like

1830
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,079
given what needs to happen is a bridge

1831
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,760
the best solution or maybe we can go

1832
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
about it a different way and the third

1833
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,920
order is well what really needs to be

1834
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,640
done here what do we value who are we

1835
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,400
those types of third-order questions

1836
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,960
which potentially even um are on an

1837
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,200
escape trajectory from science because

1838
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,119
we're not going to be looking to science

1839
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,520
in a narrow sense for the answer to that

1840
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,359
third order truly human question but we

1841
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,839
do need to expand this discussion from

1842
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,520
what is the best way to build the bridge

1843
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,240
to

1844
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,319
how are we going to go about

1845
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,400
fulfilling transporting people from side

1846
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,520
to side

1847
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,359
or making a landmark for our city

1848
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,720
there's different reasons why we might

1849
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,480
want to build a bridge and people feel

1850
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,400
like a cog in the machine

1851
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,920
if they're just being instructed at the

1852
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,920
first order

1853
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,599
like do this right but when we're

1854
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,799
including people in higher orders then

1855
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,280
we're part of a multi-scale cognitive

1856
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,359
system we're not just a quote cog in a

1857
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,760
machine so

1858
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,240
then anyone else

1859
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,920
yeah i think this um i think it's a

1860
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,599
really important point and for me it

1861
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,240
touches on um

1862
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,200
you know metzinger's uh transparency

1863
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,960
opacity

1864
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,920
kind of uh you know are we

1865
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,400
do we understand the the beliefs and the

1866
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,400
frames consciously that we're operating

1867
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
out of so in the in the bridge metaphor

1868
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,920
you know you might say

1869
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,319
um you know at the third level the third

1870
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,359
order

1871
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,599
oh it's it's really about how are we

1872
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,440
looking how you know what's the ontology

1873
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,200
or the set of metaphors that we've even

1874
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,520
coming at this system through and what

1875
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,839
effect are they having in shaping

1876
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,000
uh you know our well a how we perceive

1877
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,319
it and be up then our actions towards it

1878
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,319
so you know going right back to the

1879
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,839
beginning of this discussion it was

1880
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,520
quite interesting when stephen asked you

1881
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,480
john about

1882
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,920
architecture

1883
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,599
you know and i'm kind of thinking is you

1884
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,599
know is that um you know is that really

1885
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:16,799
is that a metaphor you know the

1886
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,479
architecture of the brain is that is

1887
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,080
that a way of looking at a brain or is

1888
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,920
it something you know this parallels the

1889
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,238
discussions about markov blankets etc

1890
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,479
etc you know like are these things that

1891
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,920
we're imposing on systems or are they

1892
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,679
things that are really there

1893
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,600
um i think the architecture one is

1894
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,799
really interesting because it kind of

1895
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:33,759
comes from this you know whole

1896
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,399
constructivist tradition and i mean i

1897
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,920
wonder more whether it's not so much

1898
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,839
whether it's about the right

1899
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,319
you know the most accurate way of seeing

1900
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,399
but what particular sets of affordances

1901
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,799
does a model or a way of seeing offers

1902
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,719
you know in the face of this particular

1903
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,279
problem in this particular niche perhaps

1904
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,759
so yeah interesting stuff

1905
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,120
thank you lee

1906
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,359
um john continue or stephen and then

1907
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:58,960
john feel free to continue

1908
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,719
yeah just one last piece i think that

1909
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,238
this there's

1910
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,080
some areas that

1911
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,040
i'm trying to apply these isms now and

1912
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,040
to sort of put some buckets i think the

1913
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,439
social constructivism is is an important

1914
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,759
one to think about maybe science in a

1915
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,319
way kind of fits in there in a way as a

1916
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,679
human pursuit

1917
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,238
pragmatism i think is very well aligned

1918
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,759
um with

1919
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,120
the kind of

1920
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,359
approach of active inference and this

1921
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,359
approach here if you take pragmatism

1922
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,920
from a you know a human not a humanistic

1923
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,880
perspective

1924
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,319
well from the third one which is an

1925
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,640
ecological perspective so

1926
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,880
or any ways of knowing as well not even

1927
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,719
perspective so you can drop down into

1928
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,799
ways of knowing perspectives

1929
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,238
you know pragmatism social

1930
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,679
constructivism and ecological

1931
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,679
approaches and i think

1932
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:48,399
that

1933
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,359
nexus is is quite important

1934
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,439
as as a sort of

1935
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,199
way to hold some of these ideas

1936
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,280
this is you know this is a fantastic

1937
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,360
conversation and uh

1938
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,840
and i would say that um

1939
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
exactly the kind of conversation that

1940
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,679
would be needed to

1941
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,000
to move such a project forward it would

1942
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,400
be conversations like this

1943
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,640
you know between scientists within the

1944
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,159
communities

1945
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,760
between communities

1946
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,080
and touching it on the all these

1947
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,320
uh you know some some superficial and

1948
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,560
some very deep and subtle

1949
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,080
issues and questions

1950
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,800
of

1951
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,320
how do we what are we thinking how do we

1952
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,800
do this how do we how do we measure

1953
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,960
success what do we want what is our

1954
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,840
purpose i mean you know we're just maybe

1955
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,600
starting that conversation here amongst

1956
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,880
us but

1957
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,960
i would like to offer to the science

1958
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,520
world that this could be we know

1959
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,800
this could be a

1960
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,120
function in the science world of uh you

1961
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,480
know a pursuit of study a pursuit of

1962
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,199
of uh attention

1963
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,280
and uh if it were

1964
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,600
i think that the you know the

1965
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,719
i think that's all that's really

1966
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,560
necessary actually is to put our minds

1967
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,800
to this and intelligent people uh

1968
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,400
communicating

1969
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,600
amongst themselves and engaging the all

1970
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,760
interested stakeholders could

1971
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,080
definitely make progress in this in this

1972
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,760
endeavor

1973
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,920
so great great to watch

1974
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,360
great to be part of

1975
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,400
and

1976
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,760
yeah john maybe

1977
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,360
if you want to go to another slide but

1978
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,920
that's leaves the question how do we in

1979
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,920
our dot one video it's kind of an

1980
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,080
opening the dot one is where we've had

1981
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,400
our background with the dot zeros

1982
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,159
we've hopefully read the papers and

1983
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,320
digested them written comments written

1984
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,159
thoughts to ourselves allowed that to

1985
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,719
reverberate and then we open the doors

1986
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,159
and we come together in a group

1987
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,640
discussion for point one and we also say

1988
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,960
hey the doors aren't closed more people

1989
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,800
can join this conversation

1990
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,640
whether it's next week for point two or

1991
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,640
on a broader scale so i'm just wondering

1992
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,960
whether you answer now or later who can

1993
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,719
be included and how can they be included

1994
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,400
in participating

1995
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,280
right

1996
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,719
well

1997
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,159
a few words

1998
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,719
um everyone is everyone is welcome in

1999
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,800
this conversation uh

2000
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,239
in in the in the world and communities

2001
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,719
in different uh in different

2002
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,159
different types of communities the

2003
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,480
science community other communities i

2004
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,960
mean this is this is a conversation for

2005
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,560
all of us to be had

2006
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,239
what do we want what is our purpose what

2007
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,560
are we doing how can we how can we

2008
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,159
improve

2009
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,719
uh how can we reduce uncertainty uh you

2010
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,159
know about essential variables you know

2011
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:33,600
to put a check more technically

2012
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,480
how to do that i don't know i i'm open

2013
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,800
to suggestions of how we make the next

2014
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,679
step but you know i sort of put out put

2015
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,239
out what i could put out in this series

2016
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,560
and i'm hoping that these conversations

2017
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,360
might

2018
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,400
uh lead to

2019
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,600
some

2020
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,880
actions that uh engage a larger and

2021
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,840
larger sphere of of individuals

2022
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,719
and organizations so i'm open if if

2023
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,960
there's suggestions i'm open

2024
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,840
um could you flip to uh let's see that

2025
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
would be slide two

2026
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,199
uh talk to slide eight

2027
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,199
yep go for it

2028
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:13,920
so

2029
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,520
we've touched on all these ideas and i

2030
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,679
thought maybe this might be a a good

2031
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,760
moment to to talk about some of the

2032
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,960
practical implications

2033
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,480
when in our original uh discussions this

2034
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,120
slide was coming after the

2035
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,800
after paper one which was all about

2036
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,560
world view and and

2037
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,679
seeing

2038
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,840
life as a cognitive process

2039
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,719
and

2040
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,239
seeing individuals as as overlapping

2041
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,440
uh processes of information flow

2042
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,640
and understanding that that when we talk

2043
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,520
about

2044
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
a a

2045
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,199
community

2046
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,120
improving its

2047
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,480
its

2048
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,000
quality of life and quality and

2049
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,159
environment we're talking about an

2050
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,080
extended individual an extended

2051
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,600
community that really reaches all the

2052
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,000
way to the biosphere ultimately right

2053
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,239
we're all connected with other

2054
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,400
individuals and all communities are

2055
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,719
connected with other communities and all

2056
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,239
of life is connected we're connected

2057
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,400
with our local ecosystem and with this

2058
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,980
new ecosystem so

2059
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,080
[Music]

2060
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,600
when i when i talk about uh vitality

2061
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,520
i'm talking about the vitality of the

2062
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,920
whole really that's our purpose is of

2063
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,520
human we're intelligent we're humans are

2064
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,840
very intelligent we can think a thousand

2065
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,280
years into the future of what might

2066
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,360
happen if we do something today

2067
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,440
and and humans can use that capacity to

2068
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,560
improve and uh reduce the uncertainty

2069
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,199
you know of the whole

2070
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,320
uh

2071
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,320
quality of life can prove the quality of

2072
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,560
the environment and biodiversity and all

2073
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,280
that kind of stuff so uh with that kind

2074
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,840
of theory uh theoretical aspects in the

2075
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,760
past what are some of the practical

2076
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,199
implications

2077
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,040
like how how would we use any of that

2078
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,960
information to actually think about

2079
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,320
design for societal systems right

2080
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,360
so um so this is a list of something

2081
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,920
some items that we have talked about in

2082
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,679
previous talks and even touched on today

2083
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,679
and when we think about what does this

2084
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,199
mean practically

2085
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,239
i would like to focus that

2086
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,400
to a different question really and that

2087
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,199
is how do we how does any individual any

2088
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,120
organism solve a problem like what is

2089
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,880
necessary to solve a problem whether

2090
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,760
you're a bacteria or you're a human's

2091
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,120
community right

2092
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,560
what do you do

2093
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,199
and and on the left are i would say some

2094
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,040
of the universal aspects of of cognition

2095
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,239
uh for example you have to gather data i

2096
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,560
mean you're the intelligent

2097
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,880
being is processing information and

2098
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,159
information means that some kind of data

2099
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,120
or

2100
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:53,840
uh

2101
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,760
information has to come from the world

2102
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,679
and then it can be processed it has to

2103
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,000
remember for example

2104
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,719
it has to anticipate the future forecast

2105
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,679
the future with some accuracy in order

2106
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,640
to survive if if i see a you know if a

2107
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,600
lie if i see a lion in my path

2108
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,320
uh i might want to accurately forecast

2109
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,679
that if i don't get out of the way i

2110
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,199
might be the lion's dinner right i mean

2111
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,080
anticipation is central to cognition

2112
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,560
so so we i've only talked about the

2113
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,159
first three in the list there but

2114
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,840
already let's we could talk about what

2115
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,880
does that mean for a community then

2116
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,360
so how does a community gather data for

2117
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,480
example

2118
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,080
and that might be

2119
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,880
you know through sensors through

2120
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,840
through

2121
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,719
um

2122
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:41,679
through

2123
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,520
getting the input of others in the

2124
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,000
community about some particular issue

2125
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,239
um

2126
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,640
requires remember like remembering

2127
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,719
requires that that information be kept

2128
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,440
in some kind of accessible

2129
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,320
form some kind of repository of

2130
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,679
information

2131
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:00,480
uh

2132
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,000
we can think already of ways that

2133
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,199
society does the does these now we we

2134
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,440
for example the census bureau

2135
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,520
collects information uh

2136
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,080
you know annually and

2137
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,080
every 10 years collects various kinds of

2138
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,120
information

2139
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,360
there's there's financial

2140
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,840
surveys done every few years

2141
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,960
uh some of that information is put in

2142
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,400
repositories that that at least

2143
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,159
researchers can access for different

2144
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,199
reasons

2145
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,159
but how

2146
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,679
you know how does that how would that

2147
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,000
differ how do how does what we do today

2148
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
how might that differ from

2149
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,679
if we were really thinking of

2150
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,640
communities as cognitive organisms

2151
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,400
how might we improve on any of these

2152
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,360
processes right

2153
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,800
and i don't know if there's thoughts on

2154
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,880
that but i can yeah yeah stephen stephen

2155
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,400
go ahead yeah i mean one thing i think

2156
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,239
that's interesting is this this actually

2157
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:54,000
points as well though to an interesting

2158
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,960
dilemma i don't know if it's a dilemma

2159
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,159
but certainly a

2160
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:00,800
challenge

2161
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,480
in the sense that

2162
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,080
um these artifacts and these artifacts

2163
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,080
of knowledge that we have

2164
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,440
they're kind of

2165
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,040
we have the option in a community

2166
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,440
setting to place them in our environment

2167
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,600
because they aren't they can be

2168
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,360
equilibrium

2169
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,920
based artifacts so for instance if i

2170
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,960
create a book and i put it on a shelf

2171
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,719
it could be their hundred years right

2172
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:25,840
and they'll come back and it's still a

2173
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,280
book right

2174
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,760
so you've got this ability for that kind

2175
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,440
of storage now when i remember something

2176
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,440
i i'm with active influence i'm

2177
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,840
establishing this kind of

2178
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,760
priors an update of priors

2179
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,600
um this is

2180
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,000
generated on these lower level

2181
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,840
sensory flux

2182
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,159
pieces of um

2183
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,600
sensorum which i have at higher levels

2184
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,040
potentially

2185
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,600
started to

2186
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,840
interpret as what you might call a

2187
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,280
signal

2188
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,960
but it you get into this interesting

2189
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,320
question because it's it's like the

2190
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,880
error is kind of the signal in active

2191
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,719
inference although it's possibly at

2192
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,120
higher levels of thinking

2193
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,719
it gets a little bit different because

2194
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,080
we've been talking about that with some

2195
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,000
of the modelling but there's a there's

2196
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,360
an interesting

2197
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,600
question around as you scale out

2198
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,440
where some of this sense

2199
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,679
data in active inference is kind of held

2200
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,679
in the kind of collective knowing of a

2201
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,280
community

2202
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,600
which knows how to interact for instance

2203
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,360
with the artifacts

2204
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,239
yet you've also got aspects a bit like

2205
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,760
i've got my clothes and i've got other

2206
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,120
things that kind of they part of me are

2207
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,320
they not part of me they're part of the

2208
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,560
environment you you there's i think

2209
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,840
there's something quite interesting and

2210
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,360
i i think that's an area i'm really

2211
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,440
interested in exploring is

2212
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,440
is teasing that out so i wonder what

2213
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,239
your thoughts are on that

2214
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,040
uh

2215
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,880
well part of part of

2216
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,719
i think part of what you're

2217
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,400
speaking about might be what i've been

2218
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,280
calling richness of information right so

2219
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,320
so obviously a a census can collect

2220
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,880
information once a year about you know

2221
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,560
numbers and

2222
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,480
education levels and things like that

2223
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,480
that's one that's one stream of

2224
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,840
information a valid stream of

2225
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,239
information and yet another is very

2226
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,199
personal it's what it what is your gut

2227
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,120
you know what is your gut telling you

2228
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,639
about this situation or this

2229
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,120
you know this this constellation of

2230
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
what's happening today what is your gut

2231
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,080
feeling

2232
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,239
of what's happening right so how does

2233
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,639
the how does a community get you know

2234
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,520
process uh sense and process

2235
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,679
all of that information together if you

2236
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,600
have a you know if we're if we're part

2237
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,639
of the community and we're trying to

2238
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,639
decide on some issue

2239
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,239
it would be good if we heard your gut

2240
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,000
you what is your gut telling you about

2241
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
this is this good or bad or should is

2242
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,080
this direction good or bad or you know

2243
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,080
even if even if there's no

2244
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,639
like data data to back it up what is

2245
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,400
your sense

2246
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,840
based on you know the the the your your

2247
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,480
complexity your wholeness your

2248
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,560
like we can't even put a word on it what

2249
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,159
you what you are or where that

2250
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,159
information comes from maybe but what is

2251
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,920
this what is the sense that you're

2252
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,920
having and i would like to share my

2253
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,440
sentence too

2254
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,840
and everyone maybe could share their

2255
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,719
sense so how do we how do we do that in

2256
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,480
how do we do that when there's a hundred

2257
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,120
thousand of us how do we do that

2258
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,239
well

2259
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:28,960
yeah

2260
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,719
uh to give just a few thoughts there's

2261
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,719
there's two sides to the conversation

2262
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,320
they're sharing communicating and then

2263
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,280
there's really engaging and listening

2264
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,120
which is part of the idea of attention

2265
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,840
topic so 100 000 people speaking over

2266
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,639
each other is zero conversation that's

2267
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,320
not yeah yeah that's not conversation

2268
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,400
right exactly so how do we how do we do

2269
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,440
that

2270
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,840
and and i don't think that that's not

2271
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,600
you know like it's almost surprising in

2272
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,880
a way that

2273
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,320
that we we have such enormous technical

2274
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,199
capacity in today's society to do

2275
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,199
unbelievable things

2276
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,880
and yet this very basic question of how

2277
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,080
do we as a community of say 10 000 or

2278
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,440
100 000

2279
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,239
how do we richly share information in a

2280
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,800
way that all of us feels heard

2281
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,600
that that are that we can express our

2282
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,320
our

2283
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,199
our kind of like hard knowledge and gut

2284
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,880
knowledge

2285
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,239
how do we participate together in

2286
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,000
describing our situation describing our

2287
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,480
fears describing our uncertainty

2288
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,400
anticipating what is going to happen

2289
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,920
next if we take choice a b or c

2290
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,520
you know you it's kind of interesting

2291
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,600
that that that that

2292
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,880
that tool

2293
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,320
doesn't exist

2294
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,639
in spite of our technological process

2295
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,239
and there might be reasons why that i

2296
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,520
mean there might be political reasons

2297
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,600
and economic reasons why that tool

2298
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,360
doesn't exist because if that tool did

2299
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,719
exist

2300
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,719
people would want to

2301
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,719
participate you know like naturally i

2302
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,280
want my story heard i want i want my

2303
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,440
community to understand what i know

2304
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,480
because maybe it's going to help

2305
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,600
somebody

2306
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,080
and and i want to hear what what

2307
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,360
you know in a in a healthy conversation

2308
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,679
in a healthy exchange i really want to

2309
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,920
know what you're thinking

2310
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,400
and i want to i want to

2311
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,639
contextualize all this information in

2312
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:23,840
light of

2313
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,239
what our purpose is what our goal is

2314
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,719
what are we after what do we want

2315
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,520
right

2316
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,159
yeah

2317
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,440
well can i comment on that because i

2318
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,719
think this is a really important point

2319
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,719
and and also though as well as see

2320
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,440
this is what i find i'm i'm recasting

2321
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,800
speech as an action policy

2322
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,840
as an extended cognition into a spatial

2323
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,880
landscape of semantics right so

2324
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,400
effectively it's

2325
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,560
actually words could be seen as in a

2326
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,639
virtual environment that we're

2327
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,840
projecting out and what that can kind of

2328
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,520
open up is

2329
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,480
that

2330
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,520
when

2331
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,400
i'm talking to someone and being heard

2332
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,080
right which basically means

2333
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,960
being

2334
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,880
words are being heard right

2335
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,120
so but there's there's certain things

2336
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,920
that

2337
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,840
i can't communicate through words

2338
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,280
because they're not in that semantic

2339
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,000
landscape which is the compression of my

2340
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,400
a useful tool but the thing with tools

2341
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,280
is

2342
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,040
generally speaking it's not very healthy

2343
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,920
to relate to tools right it's like tools

2344
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,960
of things

2345
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,280
so one non-verbal work can be really

2346
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,800
powerful we actually had that with our

2347
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,560
work within the community who use

2348
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,320
alternative communication you know we've

2349
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,480
really pushed that so they it can take

2350
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,800
them three minutes to do three words

2351
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,920
because if they're using the head switch

2352
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,040
and they have to scan through each

2353
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,719
letter and then hit the head switch and

2354
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:45,440
then

2355
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,440
so we'll really about how about it not

2356
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,480
being about the words and about being

2357
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,000
the look of the eye

2358
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,040
and that

2359
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,960
building up of

2360
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,880
non-verbal

2361
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,360
knowing between people which at some

2362
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,560
point

2363
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,560
will probably be well we actually then

2364
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,000
articulate that through fabric

2365
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,840
landscapes so then they start painting

2366
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,320
the room and do world building and then

2367
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,560
you start making the words so there's

2368
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,520
there's something about um like you said

2369
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,280
there may be something that taught well

2370
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,199
we need we need the tools but also

2371
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,679
sometimes tools just can't go there so

2372
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,400
what do we do where we don't use tools

2373
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,159
um and then when do we bring it into a

2374
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,679
tool-based environment i think this is a

2375
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,840
good point yeah yeah yeah

2376
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,000
and i think much of human communication

2377
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,159
actually happens non-verbally too if we

2378
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,000
can be in the same room and i'm watching

2379
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,960
your

2380
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,800
facial expressions i'm getting a lot

2381
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,040
more information about you and your

2382
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,280
intent than if we if i was only hearing

2383
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,719
your voice if i was only reading your

2384
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,400
words so

2385
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,159
sure there's there's nonverbal

2386
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,520
communication there's artistic

2387
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,040
expression there's

2388
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,600
there's poetic expression you know using

2389
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,199
words in a different way

2390
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,560
uh

2391
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,280
and

2392
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,199
and

2393
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,320
obviously we again we as an individual i

2394
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,639
want to be heard and if i'm maybe i'm

2395
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,320
expressing myself in words maybe i'm

2396
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,040
expressing myself in my how i'm raising

2397
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,520
my eyebrows or maybe i'm express maybe i

2398
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,199
don't even have words to express myself

2399
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,040
but i have an image in my head that i

2400
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,159
want to communicate somehow somehow we

2401
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:21,600
we have to be able to communicate richly

2402
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,639
uh

2403
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,840
in

2404
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,520
in mass

2405
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,960
and how do we do that and part of the

2406
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
answer to that might be we communicate

2407
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,719
in smaller groups

2408
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,840
and that information then is is sort of

2409
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,719
propagated up the hierarchy or something

2410
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,679
maybe i mean you know the the the the

2411
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,920
slate is wide open here so this is the

2412
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,000
question to the world

2413
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,080
how can we communicate richly in mass

2414
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,960
such that our purpose might be fulfilled

2415
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,360
you know our our purpose of of

2416
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,840
maintaining achieving and maintaining

2417
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,800
uh vitality into the future

2418
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,120
right so that's the big picture and then

2419
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,520
how what are the what are the what are

2420
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,520
the many tools or

2421
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,480
social norms or

2422
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,280
educational processes or

2423
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,480
you know

2424
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,040
any number of things that lead us to

2425
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,800
fulfilling our purpose

2426
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,560
you know our intrinsic purpose i should

2427
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,320
say you know our biological purpose in a

2428
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,679
sense

2429
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,920
nice john i hope that

2430
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,400
people clip that out or hear your

2431
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,400
question and really consider it and what

2432
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,880
it makes me think about on this slide

2433
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,639
and to return it to active inference

2434
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:31,520
again

2435
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,440
is really like the rhetoric

2436
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,719
of participation because in a

2437
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,520
reward maximization culture

2438
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,199
things like communicate it's like but

2439
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,360
not now we have decisions to make

2440
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,000
whereas when we reframe about reducing

2441
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
uncertainty on a multi-scale so

2442
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,480
individual and shared generative models

2443
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,360
it's like

2444
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,440
have we communicated enough to even know

2445
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,280
each other's generative model because

2446
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,199
once i know that your generative model

2447
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,600
includes this dietary restriction

2448
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,400
i don't need 100 text messages a day i

2449
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,040
actually can generate recipes that are

2450
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,960
going to be compatible with you so it's

2451
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,400
not like we just need to have more

2452
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,560
communication or a different kind or

2453
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,400
these two people need to talk or some

2454
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,280
sort of secret trick it's actually that

2455
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,560
we can balance a lot of these sometimes

2456
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,960
locally contradictory needs

2457
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,760
like

2458
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,880
um

2459
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,480
choose two and you can find a situation

2460
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,679
where they align on this list and you

2461
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,679
could find a situation or imagine a

2462
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,520
situation where they diverge and the

2463
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,400
power comes from being able to have that

2464
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,840
goal directness and the epistemic gain

2465
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,600
and then potentially through peer

2466
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,320
mentorship or through extended cognitive

2467
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,440
architecture we could be able to mark

2468
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,880
you know where is there a yellow flag

2469
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,719
where is there a red flag where do we

2470
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,159
need to pull back

2471
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,600
and share more

2472
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,760
um about one person's generative model

2473
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,880
or

2474
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,880
how are we working as part of an

2475
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,040
integrated unit

2476
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,960
that's reducing uncertainty given the

2477
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,480
preference vector

2478
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,080
rather than

2479
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,600
well if we each just make as much money

2480
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,120
as possible then the group will have as

2481
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,679
much money as possible right

2482
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,760
so this is a different way that we can

2483
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,840
go about having that conversation and as

2484
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,679
hopefully we're drawing out

2485
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,120
it's something where everyone's

2486
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,560
perspective uh isn't just a uh

2487
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,600
group to be formed their perspective is

2488
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,480
their contribution and their value yep

2489
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,080
yeah good good

2490
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,960
we can also look to biology too how does

2491
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,239
how does uh the cells of a body

2492
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,679
make decisions you know like how does a

2493
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,840
liver know what to do and when when to

2494
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,719
act

2495
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,480
how does the heartbeat know when to

2496
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
speed up or slow down

2497
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,360
there's rich communication that happens

2498
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
multi-scale

2499
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,480
some local some distant through hormones

2500
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,040
through messengers there's enormously

2501
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
rich communication that happens between

2502
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,760
tissues and cells in order for all the

2503
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,120
pieces to

2504
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,040
understand what the you know what what

2505
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,679
what is necessary now

2506
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,239
right so i mean there's we can we can

2507
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:06,159
this is an open question it's a clean

2508
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,840
slate there's a there's a great

2509
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,080
potential for the science world and

2510
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,000
other communities to move forward of

2511
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,080
this question of how do we richly

2512
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,600
communicate and make decisions together

2513
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,120
how do we do that

2514
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,080
and uh and there's lots of biological uh

2515
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,159
examples for us to look at to gain

2516
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,679
inspiration from

2517
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,360
so a question a question from the chat

2518
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,199
just before stephen

2519
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,960
um from yvonne

2520
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,040
uh just about the tools

2521
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,760
uh

2522
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,199
how many people have used the kinds of

2523
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,560
tools that you're suggesting or it

2524
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,920
sounded like you suggested that it

2525
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,400
didn't exist but what is the preferred

2526
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,719
field for a startup from yvonne where

2527
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,040
does this tools where is this coming out

2528
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,199
of this sort of tool for communication

2529
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:46,840
and

2530
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,719
collaboration sure i understand the

2531
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,480
question exactly where is it coming from

2532
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,239
he asked what is the preferred field to

2533
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,159
make a startup in

2534
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,000
for this kind of a tool

2535
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,600
like would it be

2536
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,239
in the field of industrial engineering

2537
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,870
or oh

2538
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:04,400
[Music]

2539
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,679
so i have

2540
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,840
ideas in my head of how we might you

2541
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,880
know start to build such tools

2542
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,760
um

2543
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,440
and

2544
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,840
the you know the reason i'm thinking

2545
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,159
about it is for this very

2546
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,840
this very problem of how to communicate

2547
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,400
how do communities communicate how if

2548
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,480
this club model were to if we were to

2549
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,239
move forward with uh

2550
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,320
with studying this club model and

2551
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,400
eventually developing a field trial with

2552
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,800
a club model how does communication

2553
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,040
happen within that club model so that's

2554
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,360
that's my interest you know is the

2555
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,280
application to this problem of societal

2556
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,040
transformation and

2557
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,880
and demonstrating new ways of of

2558
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,280
cognition at the local level

2559
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,560
via clubs

2560
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,880
but obviously if you had a tool that

2561
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,520
could do this there would be tremendous

2562
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,560
opportunities for others to to use the

2563
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,040
tool too

2564
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,600
this is just one example of

2565
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,360
you know thousands you might think of

2566
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,080
but

2567
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,199
um i used i work in the utility industry

2568
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,520
and i've seen how messages get

2569
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,080
transferred from you know a caller calls

2570
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,320
in and says you know there was a there's

2571
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,840
a there's an accident there's a wire

2572
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,760
down there's sparks flying there's

2573
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,520
children around you know there's some

2574
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,920
kind of rich situation happening that

2575
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,840
others need to know about

2576
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,800
and by the time that message gets to the

2577
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,199
person in the field or in the truck uh

2578
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,360
you know it might be quite garbled it

2579
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,120
might be

2580
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,080
it might be not unclear at all what the

2581
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,679
problem is or what the dangers are or

2582
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,840
what the situation is right so that

2583
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,400
would just be one example of how

2584
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,400
industry might use a tool for better

2585
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,840
communication

2586
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,120
uh

2587
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,480
and and

2588
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,000
you know there would be many many more

2589
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,480
examples you could think of so i would

2590
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,719
my guess would be that if the science

2591
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,639
community moved forward with this

2592
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,960
problem of how do you richly communicate

2593
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,639
with a large group

2594
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,440
that

2595
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,360
those tools and the concepts that would

2596
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,920
come out of that could be applicable to

2597
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,880
a to a wide variety of industries and to

2598
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,960
this particular question of how does the

2599
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,040
club model work and how do how do

2600
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,280
communities cognite

2601
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,440
thank you john stephen and then anyone

2602
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,600
else with raised hands

2603
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,440
yeah thanks i suppose this sort of

2604
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,120
reminds me of some of the

2605
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,880
principles actually systemic coaching

2606
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,960
can be an interesting area like looking

2607
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,199
at coaching groups that and the system

2608
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,719
it seems to be that

2609
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,960
um and i was just wondering if you've

2610
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,960
encountered um

2611
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,199
the viable systems model stafford beers

2612
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,280
viable systems model because i think

2613
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,639
that some of the active inference work

2614
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,560
can recast that you know because you've

2615
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,080
got not just

2616
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,440
levels of

2617
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,840
regulation on the on the body because

2618
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,480
it's based on the i think it's the body

2619
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,560
on the nervous system of a frog

2620
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,320
um or um

2621
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,120
or different nervous systems but

2622
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,280
that doesn't necessarily have that

2623
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,600
bottom-up teleology that you get from

2624
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,960
active inference doesn't it so you have

2625
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,639
the kind of the idea that the lower

2626
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,440
levels also know something it tends to

2627
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,880
be the higher levels of regulating the

2628
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,159
lower level so

2629
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,920
but uh hey that might be something to

2630
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,840
look at as one area that'd be

2631
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,280
interesting and

2632
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,440
um yeah i just thought i'd mention that

2633
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,239
in case you know no no great uh and uh

2634
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,120
um

2635
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,040
you know those are the kinds of ideas

2636
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,880
that would you would want to explore as

2637
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,960
you build the kind of tools we've been

2638
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,320
discussing and on that on that topic

2639
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,639
the goal is not to build one tool that

2640
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,880
does all of this right we could have

2641
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
many tools we could you know different

2642
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,719
groups could explore a variety of

2643
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,639
approaches and tools and

2644
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,400
and uh you know

2645
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,280
some depths of simplicity and complexity

2646
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,600
and you know there's room for

2647
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,080
room for

2648
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,440
many discussions on on this topic right

2649
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,520
um one other just just to kind of

2650
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,400
continue with you the idea of coaching

2651
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,520
i've been

2652
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,920
i've been around enough folks in my life

2653
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,159
to realize that some groups and some

2654
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:05,119
people

2655
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,239
are really

2656
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:09,440
skilled at communicating and talking

2657
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,400
with others and you know getting

2658
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,360
facilitating group conversation and

2659
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,159
things like that and and

2660
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,320
many times i've been just so impressed

2661
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,880
with the ability of certain groups or

2662
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,560
certain individuals to

2663
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,040
to kind of facilitate communication and

2664
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,360
and show by example what healthy

2665
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,280
communication looks like

2666
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,239
and uh and and at the same time i watch

2667
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:38,000
tv of you know i've seen tv shows of

2668
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,800
terrible examples of how to communicate

2669
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,080
uh you know examples of dishonesty

2670
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,880
examples of manipulation examples of

2671
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,360
holding back examples of

2672
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,960
of confusion

2673
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,119
you know examples of shallow

2674
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,040
shallow thinking and

2675
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,000
uh you know social norms part of this

2676
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,400
whole process would also be to do like

2677
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,920
the club model it would be to develop

2678
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,239
social norms that are useful for the

2679
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,400
community right that are reinforced to

2680
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,880
healthy healthy behaviors or healthy

2681
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,800
ways of communicating health healthy

2682
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,960
skill development

2683
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,960
that would help the community to better

2684
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,440
process the information it has right so

2685
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,199
so that kind of coaching is available

2686
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,560
too

2687
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,000
and this is something in the narrative

2688
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,320
as active inference we talked about when

2689
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,960
we see representations of communication

2690
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,960
like they are

2691
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,600
up weighted or our priors are updated to

2692
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,440
think that those types of communication

2693
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,639
are more likely or that they're

2694
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,960
prevalent or even that they exist at all

2695
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,280
and then we fulfill that prediction by

2696
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,280
reducing our uncertainty about our own

2697
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,440
behavior and our own thinking through

2698
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,600
other minds of other people's behavior

2699
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,360
thinking well what happens when there's

2700
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,119
two people and they need to is they want

2701
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,960
the cuts in front and then you're not

2702
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,320
surprised when they do it you're not

2703
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,239
surprised when you do it

2704
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:55,760
but there's also a way to show

2705
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,480
representations of that not happening so

2706
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,239
that it will not surprise either person

2707
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,080
when they both slow down

2708
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,440
and that shows how our inter-subjective

2709
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,840
level of computation is something that

2710
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,440
is influenced by both the bottom up you

2711
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,520
know the sensory input and the top down

2712
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,760
with our cultural scaffolding

2713
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,639
and so

2714
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,480
systems in change

2715
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,560
need to be able to resonate from the

2716
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,400
small to the large

2717
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,840
or there's going to be some um

2718
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,760
pathologies so stephen and then any

2719
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,520
other comments

2720
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,000
so this actually could be an interesting

2721
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,480
or could inform anyway the types of

2722
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,040
questions that could compose to carl

2723
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,639
fristen himself you know around some of

2724
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,719
these practical implications so we could

2725
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:37,920
have these in mind so i was just

2726
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,480
thinking you know do you have sort of

2727
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,480
i wonder if you actually have thoughts

2728
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,920
about oh

2729
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,880
are there holes in this or are there

2730
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,960
questions around

2731
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,080
where this

2732
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,760
whole field of active inference is sort

2733
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,960
of going in the sort of global sense and

2734
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,880
and whether you've thought oh i wonder

2735
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,480
what

2736
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,360
what

2737
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,800
carl fiston would think about that

2738
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,400
anyway it's just just a question to put

2739
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,440
out

2740
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,679
carl if you're listening

2741
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,520
feel free to

2742
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,440
to join in

2743
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,199
no i would love to i would love to you

2744
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,080
know we

2745
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,400
one of the many ways to start this whole

2746
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,760
process off would be to have a

2747
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,239
conference where we get together some

2748
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,400
folks who have experience in these

2749
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,719
fields in a variety of fields who could

2750
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,960
offer their thoughts and

2751
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,159
cautions and encouragements

2752
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,639
whatever they may be well well john um

2753
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,920
on june 21st 2021

2754
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,560
carl firsten will be joining us for a

2755
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,119
little symposium and in another sense we

2756
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,880
have a nano symposium

2757
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,320
every week but any type of logistics or

2758
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,239
organization that are the enabling

2759
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:48,800
architecture is what active lab is there

2760
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,920
for

2761
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,520
great fantastic

2762
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,360
fantastic

2763
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,920
um fantastic you know i maybe should say

2764
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,119
too we've been talking about active

2765
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,639
inference and obviously all of us are

2766
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,880
interested in that topic but but you

2767
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,360
know it could be that the active

2768
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,760
inference 2.0 is called something else

2769
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,679
it goes you know like we learn something

2770
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,679
in the next decade or whatever and

2771
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,760
active inference is no longer

2772
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,520
you know like we've moved beyond that

2773
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,199
and now we're talking about

2774
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,280
some other thing you know what the the

2775
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,239
important

2776
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:21,119
aspect of this for us is how does

2777
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,600
cognition happen how does

2778
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,840
you know how how

2779
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,400
biological organisms uh structure

2780
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,080
themselves and orient themselves and

2781
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,480
organize themselves in order to process

2782
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,639
information and you know how does that

2783
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:35,520
work

2784
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,960
so whether it's active inference or

2785
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,119
whether it's

2786
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:42,000
you know something else

2787
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,760
sure everything evolves we learn as we

2788
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,679
go so it might be you know next year it

2789
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,600
might be a different word

2790
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,119
but the concept is how do we

2791
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,520
achieve and maintain vitality into the

2792
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,360
future you know that's how do we fulfill

2793
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,400
our purpose and even today for different

2794
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,400
non-english human languages and for

2795
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,880
computer languages the word is already

2796
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,040
not active inference and so that's why

2797
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,840
it's always so rewarding and valuable to

2798
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,560
be very clear on what active inference

2799
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,440
is which parts are drawing from bayesian

2800
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,000
statistics from complex systems from

2801
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,400
predictive processing from all of these

2802
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,400
other areas instead of thinking that we

2803
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,920
need to reinvent the wheel because we

2804
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,760
certainly don't we're also just a part

2805
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,040
of the cognitive architecture and uh

2806
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,600
it'll be a quite interesting ride for

2807
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,480
sure so maybe in the last 15 minutes of

2808
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,360
this point one john

2809
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,760
help us uh via another slide or by

2810
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,000
raising another salient question what

2811
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,560
can we as listeners and participants

2812
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,880
think about in this next week

2813
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,520
to um kind of simmer during this week

2814
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,040
between our two sessions

2815
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,400
okay um

2816
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,400
okay um

2817
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,480
maybe next week we will talk we'll talk

2818
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,480
more about you know we've we've only

2819
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,560
covered two slides here we had i think

2820
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,800
like 60 slides we could have looked at

2821
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,159
we covered two of them remember maybe

2822
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,199
three of them

2823
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:08,000
uh but the the uh

2824
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,719
the

2825
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:10,239
the goal here was to talk about part

2826
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:13,040
three of the paper which is design

2827
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,440
so i think maybe for our listeners maybe

2828
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,639
the question of like how would you

2829
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,560
actually do this what would

2830
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,360
i in parts in part three i

2831
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,480
i

2832
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,280
spent some time talking about a a

2833
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,199
prototype called the what i call the

2834
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,199
leader framework local economic direct

2835
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,679
democracy association framework and the

2836
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,280
emphasis there it is the the concept is

2837
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,440
a full integrated systems approach but

2838
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,840
the emphasis in the simulation trial

2839
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,639
that i published is on economics so just

2840
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,040
take that alone what would

2841
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,360
what would a fundamentally different

2842
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,920
economic system look like how would it

2843
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,639
function and how how could it apply to a

2844
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,560
club model you know like implemented at

2845
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,119
the local level what what what did that

2846
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:58,719
look like

2847
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,560
and when i say economic i mean economic

2848
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,600
slash financial slash monetary

2849
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,679
uh institutional you know like all of

2850
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,600
those things wrapped up into the word

2851
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,280
economic

2852
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,880
what how

2853
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,400
how would that look

2854
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,600
what are the possibilities

2855
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,400
right

2856
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,560
we'll go there next maybe great question

2857
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,520
one thought is um econ eco

2858
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,719
and uh ecosystem and economy it's like

2859
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,480
they start with the first three letters

2860
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,000
they're so close they're almost on the

2861
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
right track with an ecological

2862
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,239
perspective on economics yet you add one

2863
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:37,119
more letter and it changes from uh

2864
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,440
ecology to economics and all of a sudden

2865
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,400
it's like never the twain shall meet so

2866
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,679
it's an awesome question to be

2867
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,280
rethinking how these different

2868
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,040
intertwined systems relate just like

2869
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,119
intertwined systems in an ecosystem of

2870
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,440
like primary producers prey animals

2871
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,159
predators renewal etc

2872
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,480
right right so so on that you know just

2873
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,199
to follow that up just a little more

2874
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,440
what is an economic system

2875
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,760
you know before we go about designing

2876
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,159
new ones what what is the purpose of an

2877
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,840
economic system

2878
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,760
we ought to ask that question first

2879
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,760
before we jump into potential designs

2880
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,520
right so what is what what is it

2881
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,760
supposed to achieve in the first place

2882
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,320
and the i think for some listeners or

2883
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,000
for you know the general population at

2884
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,920
least if you ask that question the

2885
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,080
answer would be like duh an economic

2886
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,239
system is about to

2887
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:28,719
you know allocating resources back and

2888
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,880
forth you know choosing who gets what

2889
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:31,679
and

2890
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,920
and how resources are used

2891
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,159
but i would argue that that's not at all

2892
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:38,719
with an economic system you know like

2893
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,040
like intrinsically potentially what an

2894
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,040
economic system is i would say an

2895
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,719
economic system is exactly what we've

2896
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,960
been talking about so far today it is it

2897
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,520
is a cognitive system it is a it is a

2898
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,159
different variety of cognitive system

2899
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:55,119
that allows a community to

2900
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:57,679
cognate in a slightly different way like

2901
01:43:57,679 --> 01:43:59,360
a governance system allows its community

2902
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,600
to cognate in one way legal system

2903
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,280
allows a community to cognate in a

2904
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,199
different way and an economic system

2905
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,600
allows it to cognate in a different way

2906
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,480
so if so if the goal is

2907
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,199
functional societal cognition

2908
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:17,040
what does an economic system look like

2909
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,719
what one thought on that and using the

2910
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,199
bodies intertwined signaling systems

2911
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,480
like neurological chemical etc from the

2912
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,880
point of view of the ribosome the

2913
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,920
protein translating machinery insulin is

2914
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,239
just another peptide it's just linking

2915
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,080
the amino acids together and it's making

2916
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,480
a protein but to the point of view of a

2917
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,719
receptor the insulin molecule is in

2918
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:40,960
affordance for binding and then to the

2919
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,159
point of view of the downstream

2920
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,639
signaling cascades inside the cell we

2921
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,880
start to see semantics enter into the

2922
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,679
picture and then there's a turnover for

2923
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,280
the insulin and there's lactate being

2924
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,639
shuttled from the muscles which are

2925
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:54,639
using it and they're they're calling out

2926
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:55,600
for help through these different

2927
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,360
mechanisms so it's like

2928
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,920
a cargo ship might be carrying

2929
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:00,960
something

2930
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,199
and it's putting it in a box and it's

2931
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,520
just moving it like an encrypted message

2932
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,679
it's just moving the information it

2933
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,520
doesn't need the semantics to be able to

2934
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,159
relay the information and similarly when

2935
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,639
there's these intertwining systems it's

2936
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,639
like that one insulin peptide can be

2937
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,080
handled by a producer by a transporter

2938
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:20,880
by a

2939
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,360
signal detector by a degrading enzyme

2940
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,840
and the idea that all of those pieces

2941
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,199
are uh

2942
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:28,560
you know you could just change one out

2943
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,719
or you could remove one it wouldn't be

2944
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:32,719
the same system as a whole

2945
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,920
so stephen and then any other thoughts

2946
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,719
i like the hormone um

2947
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:40,639
reference um

2948
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,320
as i think that

2949
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,480
the the nature of the hormone system

2950
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,639
where you you know the hormone gets

2951
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,800
released into the blood

2952
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,639
let's say the blood and it travels

2953
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,840
around the body

2954
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,320
it is actually maybe closer to this idea

2955
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
of a message passing kind of

2956
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,880
signal going out there you know

2957
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,040
sort of sense in sort of a general way

2958
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,960
which is and maybe this is something

2959
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,040
that the economic

2960
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,360
system does right is

2961
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,199
and you can't do that so easily through

2962
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:11,119
necessarily just

2963
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,119
dynamical processes with people right

2964
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,639
it's like okay you can you can kind of

2965
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:15,920
infer things you can sort of build

2966
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,639
things up but okay you set up a pipeline

2967
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,400
of value distribution

2968
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,560
or at least the information in relation

2969
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,639
to value distribution and how that can

2970
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:28,080
be processed and you can release

2971
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,719
your hormones which is basically money

2972
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:31,520
or

2973
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,880
budgetary

2974
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,119
predictions into that

2975
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:37,280
system and it flows right it flows

2976
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,440
around it and it gets picked up and it

2977
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,000
becomes more like a traditional signal

2978
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,080
that can be computed

2979
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,600
and but you can't put out the dynamical

2980
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,000
system information because it

2981
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,840
it's not a thing

2982
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,239
it's done it is dynamical so there's

2983
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,760
something interesting there i think

2984
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,960
around that that that analogy to

2985
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,239
that

2986
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,239
it's the system it's the system we're

2987
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:03,920
working with to be able to explore how

2988
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,679
message passing algorithms

2989
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,639
instrumentally used by us as curious and

2990
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,719
motivated investigators

2991
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,040
allow us to act in the world to reduce

2992
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,920
our uncertainty about blood sugar

2993
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,480
so following on that the question two

2994
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,480
for the public is what is money

2995
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,719
you know like in its best sense what is

2996
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:26,960
money

2997
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:27,679
so

2998
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,600
we'll try it we'll try to tackle some of

2999
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,679
that next week when we meet again yep so

3000
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,119
just on a closing

3001
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:34,639
note we heard

3002
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:36,880
two big questions right there at the end

3003
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,800
how can we actually do it

3004
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,719
and it would be awesome if people could

3005
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:42,400
read especially the third paper in the

3006
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,800
series and look at the letter framework

3007
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,800
that john has lita

3008
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,040
that uh john has proposed and there's a

3009
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,199
simulation there and it's a scaffold for

3010
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:52,960
a lot of rich discussion so on the how

3011
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,199
can we actually do this we want to hear

3012
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:57,040
many perspectives as well as people's

3013
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,960
thoughts on the third section of paper

3014
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,119
and then the second question what is

3015
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,080
money which is of course a fascinating

3016
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,880
question for history anthropology game

3017
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,040
theory so many different areas converge

3018
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,800
on what is money and it's a system in

3019
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,520
flux as we see quite literally day to

3020
