1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,399
all right i hope we are live

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,480
hello and welcome this is active

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,760
inference live stream

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,120
6.0 it is october 9th

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
2020. i am daniel friedman and i'm going

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,800
to be

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
doing a solo contextualizing episode

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
i guess of active inference live stream

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,320
today

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,960
on the paper tale of two densities

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,680
welcome to

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,320
team com we are an experiment in online

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
team communication and learning

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
related to active inference you can find

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
us on

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,360
twitter at inferenceactive at gmail

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
via our public key base team or via

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
youtube which is where you may be

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
watching us now

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
this is a recorded and an archived live

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,559
stream so please provide us with

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,200
feedback

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
so we can improve on different aspects

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
of our work

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
all backgrounds and perspectives are

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,520
welcome here

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
and as far as video etiquette goes mute

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
if there's noise in the background

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,079
raise your hand etc here we are

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,199
in actim stream 6.0 and the goal of this

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:05,760
stream

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,479
is really to set the context for the

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,119
upcoming discussion next tuesday on

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
6.1 that discussion is going to be

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,119
on the paper a tale of two densities

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,400
active inference is

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,479
an active inference by ramps that at all

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
published in 2020 online in 2019

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
and what this video is going to do is

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
provide context for some of the ideas

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
types of models philosophical threads

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
and vocabulary

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
of the ramstead at all paper in other

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
words it will help contextualize

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
why this topic is being discussed why

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
there's a regime of attention on this

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,759
topic so to speak

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
here are the sections of this video

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,119
first

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
i'm going to frame the problem as being

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
about what the free energy principle

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
and active inference say about agents

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
and the world and their relationship

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
and then to contextualize different ways

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
of thinking about that we'll learn about

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
bayesian models and inactivism just

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
brief brief takes of course you could go

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
a lot into depth on different takes here

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,878
i'm just trying to really

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,840
cut in broad strokes and then in the

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,640
last part

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,920
of the discussion today we'll talk a

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,200
little bit about the philosophy of

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,760
science

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
as far as the difference between a

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,319
principle a theory and a hypothesis

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,520
within the first in sphere using uh his

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,319
response to an interview question so

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,200
next time

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
on uh number 6.1 we're going to discuss

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
the paper with anyone who wants to

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,879
participate so

73
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
please save and submit your questions if

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,959
you're interested

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,640
in participating or if you're watching

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
it after ask your questions then or if

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
it's before

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
get in touch with us if you want to

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
discuss all right so here it is

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
the real topic that we're going to be

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
addressing here

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
is what does the free energy principle

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,120
and

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
active inference say about the

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
relationship between the world

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,599
and agents and how we think about this

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
formally in terms of how we model it

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,800
with computers or just

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
cognitively as well as how we experience

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,920
it

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
it's just all important so this is a

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
pretty general topic and so

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
here's one example of a world and an

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,680
agent but

95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
world and agent are not only used

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
interchangeably as we'll later find out

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
because

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
one one agent's world is another world's

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,040
agent

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
and so on but really just because this

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,319
is a

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,400
pretty general framework of relational

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,599
modeling so

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
it doesn't have to be you know the the

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
globe or the world as you exactly think

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
of it and agent as in a robot agent

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
we're going to be probably thinking

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
broadly about what it means to be

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,680
connected for two things

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
and this video certainly is just an

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,280
introduction

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
to the context of some of these ideas

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
it's not a review

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
or meta-analysis or final word it's just

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,319
as i was reading through the paper it

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,159
was how i structured the information

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
and i was how i was uh thinking it might

118
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,439
make sense

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
to read some of the quotes and use those

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
as springboards to

121
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
talk about the bigger questions uh

122
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
as usual trying to start from the active

123
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,680
inference

124
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
perspective and then reach out to the

125
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
broader questions as well as

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
uh go the other way i guess and uh

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
in this video specifically as it relates

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
to free energy

129
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
principle i'll just provide the punch

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
the punchline first

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,919
the punch line is that generative models

132
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,280
are not structures

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
they're embodied and enacted regimes of

134
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,639
policy attention

135
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
and behavior so if it doesn't

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
make sense to you yet why that's the

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
punch line or why that's

138
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
one of the conclusions essentially of

139
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
this paper

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
then just keep listening and learning

141
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
sorry

142
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
so in this talk specifically the

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
structure is going to be like this

144
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,160
first we'll go through the goals of the

145
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
2020 tale of two densities paper

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,880
read through the abstract then we'll

147
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
talk about bayesian

148
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
inference models kind of steel manning

149
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
them putting them in a strong light

150
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
then talk about inactive and action

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
models pretty broadly though there's a

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
lot of nuance in both of these

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
categories then talk about agent world

154
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
modeling

155
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,680
in fep and active and

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,039
previewing mainly by reading quotes from

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,759
the paper

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
and highlighting specific claims um

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,120
highlighting

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
how active inference and free energy

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
principle build on this

162
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
uh map and territory that are in play

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
with bayesianism and activism and again

164
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
that underlying question

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
is what do we have to say about how the

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,560
world and asians and agents and agents

167
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
are related to one another

168
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
all right so the paper is called a tale

169
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
of two densities

170
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
a literature reference there active

171
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,080
inference is an active inference by

172
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
ramstead kirchoff and fristen in the

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,960
journal adaptive behavior in 2020

174
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
and the goal of the paper which i

175
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
believe is the first sentence of

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
the article is the aim of this article

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
is to clarify how best to interpret some

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
of the central constructs that

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
underwrite the free energy principle

180
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,840
fep and its corollary which means

181
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
related theory

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
active inference in theoretical

183
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,600
neuroscience and biology

184
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
namely the role that generative models

185
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
and recognition densities play

186
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
in this theory aiming to unify life and

187
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,560
mind

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
and they'll be a consistent color scheme

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
for the generative model

190
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
and the recognition densities because um

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
we're going to be looking to integrate

192
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,800
these two

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
different ways of thinking about agent

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
world dynamics

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
in the bayesian and the inactivist

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,199
worldviews

197
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
and so what we're going to talk the most

198
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
about here are

199
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
what these two densities are so you can

200
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
ask in the book what were the two

201
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
cities here we're going to ask what are

202
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,479
those two densities

203
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,280
then we can ask what is this tail that

204
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,000
integrates

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
these two densities what weaves them

206
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
together into one

207
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
narrative which helps us understand and

208
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
uh helps us learn

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
so let's go first to the abstract we

210
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
already read the title which is the

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
first way that the authors want to

212
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
represent their work now we're going to

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
look through the abstract

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,639
and then later on we'll end up defining

215
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
and working through a lot of the words

216
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
specifically but

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
starting with the abstract is the first

218
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,759
thing that you're going to read about

219
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
the paper

220
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
the aim of this article is to clarify

221
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
how best to interpret some of the

222
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
central constructs that underwrite the

223
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,199
free energy principle

224
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
and its corollary active inference in

225
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
theoretical neuroscience and biology

226
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
that may even be what we already read so

227
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
same meaning there

228
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
namely the role that generative models

229
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,440
and variational densities play in this

230
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,720
theory so those are the two

231
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
densities that we're going to be talking

232
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
about we argue

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
that these two constructs which are the

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
two densities the generative models and

235
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
the variational densities

236
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
have systematically been misrepresented

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
in the literature

238
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
because of the conflation between the

239
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
fep and active inference

240
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
that's why at the end we're going to be

241
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
really specific about the difference

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
between those two

243
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
on one hand and the distinct albeit

244
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
closely related bayesian formulations

245
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
centered on the brain

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
variously known as predictive processing

247
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,039
predictive

248
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,560
coding or the prediction error

249
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,639
minimization framework and we'll return

250
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,280
to

251
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,599
how the prediction or the predictive

252
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
brain

253
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
is uh related or different as a

254
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,599
from a philosophy of science perspective

255
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
and from a

256
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
computational perspective i guess all

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
right second part of the abstract

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
more specifically we examine two

259
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
contrasting interpretations of these

260
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
active inference

261
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
type models a structural uh or really

262
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,479
these two

263
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,080
variational densities the things that

264
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
we're eventually going to see brought

265
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
together an active inference these

266
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
okay i i believe but if it's unclear i'm

267
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,800
not

268
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
sure a structural representationalist

269
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
and an active

270
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
approach and that's going to be our

271
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
whole main discussion

272
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
we argue that the structural

273
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
representationalist

274
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
interpretation of generative and

275
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
recognition models does not do justice

276
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
to the role these constructs play in

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
active inference under the fep

278
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,519
so the main theme that's going to get

279
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
returned to is that

280
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,080
the computational side is very tractable

281
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,720
and

282
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
stable however it misses some

283
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
fundamental

284
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
components that are going to be really

285
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
complementary to the insights that are

286
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
brought from the inactive approach

287
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
we provoke we propose an inactive

288
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
interpretation

289
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
of active inference what might be called

290
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,480
an active inference

291
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
in active inference under the fep the

292
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
generative and recognition models are

293
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
best cast

294
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,839
as realizing inference and control the

295
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,760
self-organizing belief guided selection

296
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
of action policies and do not have the

297
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
properties ascribed by structural

298
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,160
representationalists so that's just

299
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,959
saying

300
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
structural representationalists are

301
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
wrong about properties in what they

302
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,959
think

303
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,160
because of actually generative models

304
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,800
being

305
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
basically cybernetic policy selectors

306
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
and

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
their claim is that that makes some of

308
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
the

309
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
stances held by structural

310
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
representationalists untenable

311
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
so let's go to the paper here's a quote

312
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,320
the question that shall occupy us is how

313
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
best to understand the function

314
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
and properties of the generative and

315
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,360
recognition models in active inference

316
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,240
under the fep

317
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
what does it mean for one theory to be

318
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
under the other we'll return to that at

319
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
the end

320
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
in light of the active processes

321
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,079
involved in orchestrating

322
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,120
maintaining and updating these models in

323
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,959
particular we examine

324
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,640
two contrasting interpretations of these

325
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,959
models a structural representationalist

326
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,360
that's

327
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
one of the schools of thought here and

328
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
an inactive interpretation so two

329
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
different interpretations

330
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
so we can summarize this up as a

331
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,000
structural representationalist versus

332
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,720
inactive whose hot take on systems will

333
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
reign supreme

334
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
so first let's just try to understand

335
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
what each of these

336
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,839
groups are really bringing to the table

337
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
because uh

338
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
that's really hopefully a

339
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
strong starting point from each of these

340
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
two sides can lead to a better synthesis

341
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
in active inference so in bayesian

342
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
inference it's a big

343
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
area this is just one way of presenting

344
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
it you can definitely watch other

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
lectures or learn from a lot of other

346
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
more

347
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
skilled people in this specific area

348
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
about bayesian approaches so

349
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
this is just one representation i was

350
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,640
trying to

351
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
make a compromise between things that

352
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
were implemented but there's so

353
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
many flavors and colors of what's

354
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
implemented in the literature

355
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,079
so i just wanted to start with a really

356
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,800
brief

357
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
overview of the bayesian inference this

358
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
is a

359
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
two level bayesian inference scheme so

360
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,399
variously

361
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,720
these two elements are known as priors

362
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,079
and hyper priors

363
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
or priors in the data but here on the

364
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,519
left side

365
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,760
we have data which are reflecting

366
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
sensory observations

367
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
like that of a sensor and then there's a

368
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
generative model

369
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
for example that generates sensor

370
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
readings and so

371
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,240
the the question that is asked in the

372
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,279
transformation

373
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
from the sensory observational data the

374
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
lower level model

375
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,120
on the left side to the generative

376
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,639
model of the data which is like often

377
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,279
the higher order parameters in the

378
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
computational model

379
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,320
the question is how do these

380
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
observations influence

381
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
or update the generative model of the

382
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,360
world and so

383
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
you can think about that as sort of like

384
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,079
empirical data coming in

385
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,279
altering your parameters that represent

386
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,360
deeper stances about the world so you

387
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
have a sensor that fluctuates more

388
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,839
rapidly

389
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,480
and then you're doing some sort of uh

390
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
stabilization

391
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
of the overall readings of the sensor

392
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
and that's like your higher order

393
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
parameter

394
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
just to give one of many samples and

395
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
then the other question that's being

396
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
asked

397
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
in the transformation from how the

398
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
parameters of the higher order model

399
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,399
influence the data is basically

400
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
what observations are emitted here given

401
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
the generative model of the world or the

402
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
generative parameters of the world which

403
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
includes

404
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
different things like world states

405
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
causes etc so here's some of the

406
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,440
features

407
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
and advantages of bayesian models so

408
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
first they can extend to basically

409
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,120
arbitrary

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
graphical models which doesn't just mean

411
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
models you can draw it means models that

412
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,079
you can graph

413
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
so it turns out that a lot of classical

414
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,040
and uh non-classical statistical

415
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,399
techniques

416
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
can be reduced down to this type of a

417
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
scheme

418
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
at the highest level statistically

419
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
it's discussed in carl firsten at all's

420
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
textbook related to spm

421
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
how these kind of bayesian inference

422
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
models relate to various

423
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,160
empirical data sets so potentially of

424
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
interest for people who want to learn

425
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,399
more about

426
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
that side the next thing that's good

427
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,839
about these models

428
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
is that they can be used to model

429
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,440
multi-scale systems so

430
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,639
through space and time of different

431
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
scales they have very tractable

432
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
computation

433
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
and implementation on hardware so you

434
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,079
can take

435
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,600
a data set and basically get

436
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
useful information out of it using this

437
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
type of a scheme so it passes the sort

438
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:13,760
of

439
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
utility check it's pretty flexible with

440
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,320
having sparse or dense multivariate

441
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
data and i'll tie that to the second

442
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
point here which is that

443
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
you can be empirical in the sense that

444
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
you're learning and updating your

445
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
position based upon data but also you're

446
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
formalizing the use of your prior

447
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,279
information

448
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,760
you're neither just informally combining

449
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
your prior information

450
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,240
with your uh newer information naively

451
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
just saying oh well they're both

452
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,199
equivalent because i have one of each

453
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
one of the past one of the present

454
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
uh it provides more formalized ways of

455
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
dealing with

456
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,519
with information and depending on how

457
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
much you rely on your prior information

458
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,519
you may only need very sparse inputs

459
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,480
from your sensor

460
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
for example you might only need a

461
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,079
thermometer in a certain location

462
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
to know whether it was in one climate

463
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
regime or another

464
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
these models can also be fit with

465
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
expectation maximization algorithms

466
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,079
that's also discussed a lot in fristen's

467
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,519
spm textbook and uh work

468
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,440
just and in the work of people who have

469
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
done a lot more on expectation

470
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
maximization algorithm

471
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
um learning then i'm going to go into

472
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
detail

473
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
in here but it's a good topic to look

474
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,079
into and one that i'm

475
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,360
still learning about too uh kind of as

476
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
stated in a few points

477
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,320
these models are pretty deeply related

478
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
to statistics

479
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
of various kinds as well as other

480
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
mathematical areas

481
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
so let's just go to the structural

482
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
representationalist interpretation

483
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
first structure i think that there's

484
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
probably wide latitude

485
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
in what the structures mean and there

486
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
were several citations that

487
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
characterize the structural

488
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
representationalist viewpoint so i'll

489
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
let them

490
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,480
speak to what structural representations

491
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
and structural representationalism

492
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
is i would say structures could

493
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,680
represent data structures

494
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
it could represent things having

495
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
structure

496
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,759
in the sense that they're

497
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
distinguishable from something else so

498
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,519
structure could be pretty broad

499
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
representations that's a whole topic

500
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
that i understand there's

501
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,560
also a lot of debate over and we've read

502
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
some other

503
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,800
act inflated papers on representations

504
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
and uh their strengths and weaknesses

505
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
and

506
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
i i just think it is what it is and

507
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
this structural representation is

508
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
holding the views that the authors have

509
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
in their citations

510
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,079
and that's where we'll sort of end the

511
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,279
discussion on the bayesian

512
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,240
inference models and think about these

513
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,519
are all really good features of the

514
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,320
model

515
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
what is going to be something that's

516
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
going to complement that from a

517
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
pragmatic and philosophy of science

518
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
perspective

519
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,839
so the second category of models is this

520
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,199
inactive

521
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,560
or active models and here

522
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
it's a lot more focused through a

523
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,919
tradition

524
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,160
of being action oriented and ecological

525
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
it's more oriented about the relation

526
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
between the world and asia

527
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
so this comes from a lot of areas like

528
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
systems and ecology so

529
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,000
the two questions that are being asked

530
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
in the inactivist perspective

531
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
are first off how the world is

532
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
influencing the agent

533
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,559
is a question about how perception is

534
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,000
influencing or updating

535
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,559
the action tendencies of the system and

536
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,120
then

537
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
the way that the agent is influencing

538
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,559
the world or that

539
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
causal arrow is kind of asking what

540
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
actions are entertained by internal

541
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
models and entailed through control

542
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
mechanisms of the agent

543
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,679
so both of the questions are about the

544
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,240
joint

545
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,679
niche between the world and the agent

546
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
which will be formalized later

547
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,600
we'll find as a markov blanket but for

548
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
now we can just think about the world

549
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
and the agent being connected through

550
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
this perception action loop

551
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,960
so what are the cool parts about the

552
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
inactive

553
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,120
or the active perspective so it's

554
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
interdisciplinary

555
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
which encompasses a lot of interesting

556
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,760
work in

557
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,320
areas like art cybernetics ecology

558
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,520
psychology

559
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
dynamical systems sociology and tech and

560
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
evolution so kind of

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
also things that the bayesian models

562
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,720
have been applied

563
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,320
in so it's not unique to this but

564
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
some of the work in these areas is very

565
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
interesting

566
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
there's a qualitative and a relational

567
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
and experiential aspect

568
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
and anything in the computational domain

569
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
it's usually a question about efficiency

570
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,919
whereas things that are in the

571
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,240
qualitative domain often it's about

572
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
concordance with our experience or

573
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
potentially even other things

574
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,799
so uh it's an interesting and different

575
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
development of theory to go down the

576
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
route of more in touch with

577
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,520
phenomenology phenomenologists

578
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
experience per se

579
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
rather than more implementable on modern

580
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
computational hardware

581
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
it naturally relates to things like

582
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
enculturation

583
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,799
developmental processes sociality

584
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,440
because

585
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,720
one agent the world could be the

586
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,840
body of another agent or it could be a

587
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,280
small community or something like that

588
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,400
it turns out that this

589
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
inactivist perspective is more amenable

590
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,520
to

591
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,240
this externalism which we discussed in a

592
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
previous active stream

593
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
and other kind of radical embodied

594
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,360
cognitive

595
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,799
theories so i i'll just

596
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,400
leave that there that's kind of more of

597
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
a connector but again there's more and

598
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,200
more

599
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
fusion between these two approaches as

600
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,559
evidenced by the discussion that we're

601
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,440
having today

602
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,919
but these inactive approaches have

603
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,960
definitely a very

604
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,039
different um literature

605
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,880
base different citation networks that

606
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,039
are linking these ideas so

607
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,520
i'm just phrasing them in a way that's

608
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
not representing

609
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
priority or importance just sort of

610
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,679
throwing out different features

611
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,440
to differentiate it strongly from the

612
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
bayesian perspective computational

613
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
perspective

614
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
all right inactive models also

615
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,200
interestingly

616
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
and this is one of the reasons why

617
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
they've recently received a lot of

618
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,200
attention

619
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
is that they're amenable to different

620
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,240
kinds

621
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
of things that maybe people would call

622
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
physical computers in 2020 like ant

623
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,840
colonies

624
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,679
slime molds landslides quantum systems

625
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,559
all these different things that uh do

626
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,480
what can only be described as special

627
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,200
types of

628
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
algorithms or computation yet

629
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
they don't do all problems so they're

630
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
they're more like a bitcoin miner

631
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,840
than a uh turing complete processor and

632
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
computing language

633
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
so they're specialized computers if

634
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
they're computers personally i don't

635
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
think the computational metaphor

636
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
applies so well because i also think

637
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
that this is a

638
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,679
perspective that takes us beyond

639
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
computationalist metaphors

640
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
of the world sometimes

641
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
but at the very least the inactive

642
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,240
perspective highlighted

643
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
all these ecological dynamics of

644
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,000
intelligence that are only now being

645
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
appreciated from a more quantitative

646
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,480
perspective

647
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
and also these active models as you

648
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
might guess are part of a broader

649
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
tradition of action and pragmatism so

650
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,799
it's a

651
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,559
another interesting area that kind of

652
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,400
intersects there

653
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,360
so here's the simplification slash uh

654
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
side by side

655
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
first i'm just gonna again try to

656
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,679
distill it another

657
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
level down without uh

658
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
leaving too many false positives or too

659
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,480
many false negatives so

660
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,159
if someone knows better about these

661
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
areas totally i'm

662
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
open to just correcting it and changing

663
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
it i'm just

664
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,760
as i read through the paper i just mock

665
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,559
this up to

666
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,480
try to understand how these theories are

667
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,600
different and similar

668
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,919
so a sort of quasi-bayesian structural

669
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,600
representationalist view

670
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
we can distill down to this we can say

671
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
that there's the data

672
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
parameters and the hyperparameters or

673
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
just the parameters of one model and

674
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
that of another and this can be

675
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
again stacked up multi-level all these

676
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,480
different things that we discussed

677
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,440
earlier

678
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
and the way that the data like coming in

679
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,960
from the sensor

680
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,039
update the hyper parameters like the

681
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
beliefs about the world

682
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
are through what is going to be called

683
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,919
the recognition model by that community

684
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
on the other hand the way that the

685
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
predictions about the world state

686
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,640
are used to generate the data parameters

687
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
is a generative model and that is just

688
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,200
like

689
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,240
also considered sensory inference now it

690
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
turns out that there's a lot of model

691
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
and inference being thrown around like

692
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,039
isn't everything a model and all this

693
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,840
sort of stuff

694
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,240
yes it does um get a little confusing

695
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
and so i've tried at a few points to be

696
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
really clear and specific but sometimes

697
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,520
in quotes

698
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,720
um they uh will use like model

699
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
or who's doing inference where and we're

700
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,320
just going to be pretty specific about

701
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
what all the connections and the pieces

702
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,400
are

703
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
and then hopefully it'll be clear um

704
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
what yeah what's similar and different

705
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,799
between these two approaches

706
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
so the outcome of the bayesian model

707
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
like a

708
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
successfully converged model that's

709
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,760
running here on a computer

710
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,679
it represents a statistical converge

711
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,360
multi-level model that represents the

712
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
structures of the world

713
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
so let's just think about the data

714
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,679
parameters like the visual

715
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,799
field like the sensor data on the retina

716
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,720
so to speak and the hyper parameters

717
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
being like where objects are

718
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
and so even though there's no color

719
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,240
vision in the periphery

720
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
and even though there's low resolution

721
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
vision in the periphery still

722
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
i'm able to have a consistent uh

723
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
relationship things look pretty normal

724
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,200
because

725
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,919
the sensory data are being generated in

726
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,400
basic

727
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
non-surprisal with the recognition

728
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
modeled sensory data

729
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
so that would represent a sort of

730
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,039
bayesian computationalist

731
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,880
perspective on vision and error

732
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
correction

733
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
and optimization on the other hand we

734
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,799
can

735
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,240
side by side with the inactive

736
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
perspective so the inactive perspective

737
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
again situates the agent in the world as

738
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
being linked through perception and

739
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,039
action

740
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,640
and the outcome of the inactive

741
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
perspective is an embodied and

742
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,159
ecological

743
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,240
action sequence or like some sort of

744
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
niche interplay

745
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,120
from an embedded agent who makes or is

746
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,679
behavior

747
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
and this is a lot of the inspiration for

748
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,120
things like plants

749
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
intelligence or something like that it's

750
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
just oh well what time scale and

751
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,720
what problems are you asking the system

752
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,640
to solve and all these things

753
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
that ultimately are the decisions and

754
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
the classifications of the scientists

755
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
or so it said uh are used to talk about

756
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
the different intelligence or

757
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,840
perception or action capabilities of

758
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,039
different agents

759
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,320
so let's try to unite this

760
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
under what is said by free energy

761
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,279
principle and active inference

762
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,960
in this gap explanatory and causally

763
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,600
between the world and the agents so on

764
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,159
the top

765
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,919
of this slide there is a figure one from

766
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
the previous paper we discussed in five

767
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
i believe and several other papers

768
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,320
and it describes this minimal loop

769
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
between the organism

770
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,720
and the environment so this is the first

771
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,279
bridge

772
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
uh connector point so if you're on board

773
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,320
with just

774
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
the questions about the world and the

775
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
agent then we're still

776
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,760
talking about just exactly that

777
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,799
and we want to build on the work

778
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,400
and the perspective of the different

779
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
insights from a few different areas

780
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
first from the schools of action

781
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,880
learning about things like inactive

782
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,559
embodied ecological practice

783
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,919
socio-technical and experiential uh

784
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,039
aspects of the inactive view that we

785
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,520
discussed a few of earlier

786
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,919
from the more inference side again

787
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,120
there's a lot of directions which

788
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,880
inference is being used in but it's one

789
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,600
of the words

790
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,159
um in active inference and so that's why

791
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,960
i'm using them

792
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,000
here and on the more inference side

793
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,679
we can think about drawing the insights

794
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,000
from

795
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
bayesian and computational approaches

796
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
statistical approaches

797
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,720
modeling uh deep learning robots so all

798
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,679
these kind of

799
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,720
interesting things that think of the

800
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,440
world

801
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,559
whether uh conceptually or just from a

802
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
scientific modeling perspective from a

803
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
computational perspective

804
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
and then also there's uh another level

805
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,360
that as we'll see is related to the

806
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
roots of active inference in the free

807
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
energy principle

808
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
but there's this whole root layer of

809
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,279
physics

810
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,159
and specifically hear things like

811
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,080
invariant

812
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,440
sets and manifolds patterns multi-scale

813
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,039
dynamics collective behavior

814
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,279
phase transitions as well as potentially

815
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
a bridge to things like unconventional

816
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
computing or more advanced or more

817
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,559
tractable world modeling

818
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,679
so here we've gone

819
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,039
one level deeper into that world agent

820
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,320
mapping so we still have world on the

821
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
left side

822
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,000
in the teal and then agent on the right

823
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,400
side

824
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
in the darker blue except they're

825
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
labeled now as internal

826
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,559
and external states and they're linked

827
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,200
through

828
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,039
these two specific types of states

829
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,640
called sensory and action

830
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,279
states so i'm going to go through a list

831
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:23,760
of

832
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
just features about the fep and active

833
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,880
sort of skeleton of how the agent in the

834
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,279
world

835
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
are related to and then see if that

836
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
covers this

837
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,640
diagram on the bottom left we'll see so

838
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
internal and external states so that's

839
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
respectively agent in the world

840
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,919
states are linked through situation and

841
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,960
model dependent

842
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
blanket states so it's not like there's

843
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,799
just one

844
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,320
simple barrier there is a something that

845
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
is contextualized that's a

846
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
functionalized

847
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,159
barrier in the context of the organism

848
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,520
or in the context of the scientists

849
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,000
modeling

850
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,399
it and so the states can be coarse or

851
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,840
fine-grained

852
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,240
and that's really a map territory

853
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
situation

854
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
so uh depending on how

855
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
coarsely grained success in a situation

856
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
can be uh

857
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,840
basically achieved then even very

858
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,799
corresponding

859
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,559
of certain strategies will work for

860
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
example and one thing that we'll return

861
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,760
to again and again

862
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,159
is that active inference is about this

863
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,679
relationship between the sensory input

864
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,200
and the action selection

865
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
not necessarily just the convergence on

866
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,120
the hypothetical model it's about the

867
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,760
action

868
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,919
so um there's this dual instrumentalism

869
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,600
and i think it was a really nice

870
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,080
sequence of points brought up by maxwell

871
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
and others in the one of the five

872
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
discussions about this dual

873
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,559
instrumentalism and so

874
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
to kind of rehearse what those two

875
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
instrumentalisms are

876
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,520
so the first usage of these types of

877
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,200
partitioning models

878
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
is as a scientific framework because any

879
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,240
system of interest

880
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,640
you can identify you can identify its

881
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,480
inputs and its outputs and its internal

882
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,240
states and its external states

883
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
and you can almost think well what would

884
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,240
what would make this false how could i

885
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,159
be outside the system and model it in a

886
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,960
way where

887
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
there was internal states that um

888
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,039
influenced external states without

889
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,440
action

890
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,399
or vice versa so that might be something

891
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,279
that we

892
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,640
don't know how to measure or it could

893
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
happen but if it's a part of your

894
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,640
model you could specify it with a

895
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
different topology we'll return to the

896
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,000
question of whether you could specify

897
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,640
different

898
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
partitioning and have it all work out

899
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
but i'd suffice to say that for now

900
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,320
we're just thinking about the skeleton

901
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
of this relationship between the

902
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
different states

903
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
and as far as modeling from a scientific

904
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
framework

905
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,880
perspective goes you can basically

906
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,919
partition any

907
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,760
measurable system into this kind of a

908
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,840
model

909
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,279
the part that was referred to as

910
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,440
speculative in the previous paper

911
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
was as to whether this is actually what

912
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,120
organisms do

913
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
and that's sort of a philosophical area

914
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,480
that let's touch on

915
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,039
later on uh and in ongoing discussions

916
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,480
because i think that's sort of

917
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,679
one of the areas that we return to uh

918
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,399
almost every week in acting extreme so

919
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,840
just

920
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
look at this diagram think about whether

921
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
you agree with the way that states are

922
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,039
partitioned

923
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,960
and keeping in mind the multi-scale

924
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,720
insights from some of the previous

925
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,799
discussions as well and could there be

926
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,799
other ways that these are connected

927
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
and then we're going to want to

928
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
specifically draw together the bayesian

929
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,880
and inactivist ways of thinking about

930
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,240
action okay

931
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,679
so here we go to the section where i'll

932
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,080
read some more quotations from the paper

933
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,919
and just highlight draw their exact

934
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,799
argument

935
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,960
about what the different schools of

936
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,240
thought bring into play

937
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,000
so first they characterized the

938
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,720
structural representationalists as

939
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
having a good take on their own

940
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,919
models but missing action as

941
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,000
a fundamental consequence of

942
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,080
a real far from equilibrium agent

943
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,679
existing in the world

944
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,120
so the primacy of action

945
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,159
means that reading from the second

946
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,039
paragraph

947
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,240
we argue that the structural

948
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
representationalist interpretation

949
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,000
of generative and recognition models

950
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,919
these two bi-directional arrows

951
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,919
while providing an accurate description

952
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,760
of these constructs as they figure in

953
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
some version of bayesian cognitive

954
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,080
science

955
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,159
so in other words being a disciplinary

956
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,760
tool

957
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
does not do justice to the generative

958
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
models and recognition

959
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,559
densities that figure in active

960
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,399
inference under the fep

961
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,440
so in other words the

962
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,919
interpretation of how those two types of

963
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,480
models

964
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
agents and world and models and hyper

965
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,760
models how those two things are related

966
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,000
uh the computationalist perspective or

967
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
the the so-called structural

968
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
representationalist perspective uh

969
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,039
it's missing some aspect uh and then

970
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,640
contrasting with the second red

971
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,080
underlined part here

972
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,799
in contrast to these other bayesian i.e

973
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
purely bayesian theories

974
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
which are in effect theories of the

975
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,840
structure function and dynamics of the

976
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,559
brain

977
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,000
active inference is a much broader

978
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,679
theory of adaptive phenotypes

979
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
that centers on the control of adaptive

980
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
behavior and that emphasizes the tight

981
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
coupling and circular causality between

982
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,279
perception and action

983
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
so that's the part that draws it more

984
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,799
naturally to systems thinking

985
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,320
and to cybernetics

986
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,000
um all right so structural

987
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,799
representationalists argue that

988
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,480
generative models function

989
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,880
as structural representations so no

990
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,080
surprises there

991
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,360
with representational content okay

992
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,880
a great summary of this view which is a

993
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,559
nice thing to say about the authors

994
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,559
reads that predictive coding theory and

995
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,919
this is being pop

996
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,960
provided as a specific

997
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
kind of sub model within this bayesian

998
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
brain

999
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
structural representationalist paradigm

1000
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
which we'll return to at the end as far

1001
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
as their formal relationship

1002
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,000
predictive coding postulates internal

1003
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,519
structures so that's where you get the

1004
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,399
structure apart

1005
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,080
who's functioning inside of a cognitive

1006
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,919
system closely resembles the functioning

1007
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,880
of cartographic

1008
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,399
maps cool it might be said that on the

1009
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,640
proposed interpretation of the theory

1010
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
cognitive systems navigate their actions

1011
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,679
so

1012
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
is it not action-oriented through the

1013
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
use of a sort of causal probabilistic

1014
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
maps of the world

1015
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
so there is a possible uh

1016
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,159
place for a structure so it's the maps

1017
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,919
are the the representations that are in

1018
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,519
the uh neural system

1019
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,960
these maps play the role of

1020
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
representations within the theory

1021
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,159
okay believe it or not i guess it so

1022
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,159
specifically this map like role is

1023
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
played by the generative model

1024
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,919
it is the generative models that similar

1025
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,519
to maps constitute action guiding

1026
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,240
detachable

1027
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
structural representations that afford

1028
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,480
representational error detection

1029
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,799
so here's what they're proposing they're

1030
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
saying that

1031
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,919
generated maps from some sort of map

1032
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,640
generator

1033
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,919
function are used to then do

1034
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,840
policy and agenda setting so action gets

1035
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,239
separated from second layer estimation

1036
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,918
in this way that's characterized as

1037
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,440
detachable

1038
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
in that right side of the third line

1039
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,879
from the bottom

1040
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,040
so it's uh that's the

1041
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,399
perspective of the authors of this paper

1042
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,079
characterizing

1043
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
hopefully in a positive light the

1044
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,520
structural representation lists

1045
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
so those are all interesting things i

1046
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
think that are cool

1047
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,719
as well as all the aspects of these

1048
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,320
models that are

1049
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,440
beneficial discussed earlier so on the

1050
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
other hand let's look at what inactivism

1051
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,719
brings to the table

1052
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,639
in this section we unpack the

1053
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
implications of the pragmatist view for

1054
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,239
understanding the relations between the

1055
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,599
generative model

1056
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,719
the generative process and the

1057
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
recognition model according to our

1058
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,079
pragmatist interpretation

1059
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,399
the organism embodies the recognition

1060
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
density and entails the generative model

1061
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,839
as a control system

1062
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,079
we then formulate a direct critique of

1063
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,079
the claim that generative models are

1064
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
structural representations

1065
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,400
so they're going to say because of

1066
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
embodied

1067
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,200
enacted whatever it is

1068
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,599
the generative model is a control system

1069
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,440
and then because of the control system

1070
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,680
and not a map of the world like where

1071
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,040
are the structures not where the

1072
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,800
processes of the world there's no

1073
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,160
google maps for processes yet

1074
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
but they're going to formulate a

1075
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
critique in the end

1076
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
that generative models are not

1077
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
structural representations because they

1078
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
are control systems and control systems

1079
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,839
are not structural representations

1080
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
they're something else process

1081
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
realizations or something

1082
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
so here's what inactivism ends up adding

1083
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,839
it ends up providing a pretty natural

1084
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,240
pragmatic and action-oriented

1085
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,040
perspective on active inference modeling

1086
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,760
it brings

1087
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,640
all of these 4e 5e cognitive

1088
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
perspectives in this is really an

1089
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,640
interesting area of research

1090
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,800
maybe there's other adjectives i can add

1091
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,680
here but

1092
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,359
it just usually is a bunch of ease

1093
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,920
inactivism is something that natural

1094
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,359
systems can carry out

1095
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,160
and it's something that we can grasp at

1096
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,079
least at the atomic level even simulate

1097
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,400
sometimes computationally

1098
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,160
and what is

1099
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,880
being gained by phrasing the entire

1100
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
system as a control system

1101
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,800
for action rather than having a

1102
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
so-called detachable

1103
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
interface like we were seeing in the

1104
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
previous approach um by framing

1105
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,200
explicitly about action

1106
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,440
you end up training on small or large

1107
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,400
data sets and

1108
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,560
evolving iterations of systems with an

1109
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,520
eye towards function

1110
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
rather than with an eye towards

1111
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
structure

1112
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,160
and that can look like a lot of

1113
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,839
different things in different areas so a

1114
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:50,800
few other

1115
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
examples of previous work in the control

1116
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,040
systems area are like cybernetics

1117
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
also control systems can include

1118
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,400
elements that are

1119
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,160
game players they can include uh

1120
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,680
elements of control that have to do with

1121
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
swarm control as well

1122
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
this was an interesting paragraph from a

1123
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,560
technical point of view

1124
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
active inference and perceptual

1125
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,920
inference are not

1126
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,720
merely two sides of the same coin

1127
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,280
instead

1128
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
active inference is the name of the

1129
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,280
formulation for policy selection

1130
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
what advocates of the bayesian brain

1131
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,280
call perceptual inference is just one

1132
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
moment

1133
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,960
of the policy selection process in

1134
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,720
active inference under the fep

1135
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,480
namely state estimation so your your

1136
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,720
your big deal is just a parameter in our

1137
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,240
model

1138
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,280
the issue we want to press here repeat

1139
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,680
is that the active inference framework

1140
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,440
implies that perception is a form of

1141
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,920
action

1142
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
that is action and perception cannot be

1143
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,680
pulled apart as they sometimes are in

1144
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
the bayesian brain framework

1145
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
so that's that detachable critique from

1146
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,880
the inactivist to the

1147
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,000
um structuralism they say because you're

1148
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
thinking structurally whatever that

1149
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,079
means

1150
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
you have some detachability between form

1151
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,200
and function

1152
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,599
we have a non-distinction between form

1153
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,480
and function

1154
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
because there's uh all these different

1155
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,920
inactive things happening

1156
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,599
so we're gonna have a better perspective

1157
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,040
because we can already

1158
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
computationally model our perspective

1159
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,839
too just like you could

1160
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
so closer to the end of the paper

1161
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,880
they write in summary the role of a

1162
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
generative model

1163
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,320
is subtle in active inference the

1164
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,760
generative model itself

1165
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
never actually exists outside the

1166
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,359
dynamics that is

1167
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,160
outside the adaptive actions and policy

1168
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,079
selection of the organism

1169
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,839
well and so i'll just note there that

1170
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
adaptive means that there's a striving

1171
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,320
for

1172
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
success but just because something is

1173
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,760
adaptive doesn't mean

1174
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,880
everyone adapts within the dynamics it

1175
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,599
provides

1176
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,760
a point of reference or definition of

1177
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,280
variational free energy

1178
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
or more precisely a definition of the

1179
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
gradients with respect to internal and

1180
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,280
active states

1181
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,040
given that the vicarious realization of

1182
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
the generative model through a

1183
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
minimization of the variational free

1184
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,200
energy

1185
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,599
can only be through action and changes

1186
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,640
in internal state

1187
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
we can think of the generative model as

1188
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
being enacted and of the recognition

1189
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,079
density as being embodied

1190
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,280
so what is being said here is

1191
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,640
because there's sort of this

1192
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
thermodynamic forwardness

1193
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
that drives the active inference process

1194
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
as far as far from equilibrium systems

1195
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,960
doing what they do

1196
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,000
because those two things are enacted and

1197
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
embodied

1198
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,359
and because it maps onto some of these

1199
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,359
previous distinctions that were

1200
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,040
raised and at least computationally

1201
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,800
resolved in the computationalist

1202
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
paradigm so we want to draw those

1203
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,400
mappings about data

1204
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
and about higher order perceptions of

1205
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,320
data map that onto our understanding of

1206
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
the world but

1207
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,920
not end up computationalizing the world

1208
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,599
per se that's one implication there's

1209
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,359
probably others

1210
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
and then they say this speaks directly

1211
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:58,960
to embodied

1212
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,599
and inactive approaches in cognitive

1213
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,480
neuroscience

1214
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
and provides a computationally tractable

1215
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,920
framework for the metaphors mobilized by

1216
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,720
these paradigms

1217
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
so they're again they're saying like

1218
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
we'll be able to computationally

1219
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,880
so more attractively do some of the

1220
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,760
stuff that people

1221
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,079
thought philosophically or ecologically

1222
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,640
would be cool

1223
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,720
representationalists argue that

1224
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,160
generative models encode

1225
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
exploitable structural information about

1226
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,599
the world

1227
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,960
our analysis suggests that this is false

1228
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,880
indeed in this article we sought to

1229
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,160
underpin the claim that generative

1230
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,359
models do not

1231
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
encode anything directly they are rather

1232
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,760
expressed in embodied activity and

1233
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,359
leverage information encoded in the

1234
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,960
recognition density which is an

1235
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
approximate posterior belief or best

1236
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,000
guess

1237
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,839
assuming our conclusion is correct and

1238
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,280
why wouldn't you

1239
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,839
our inactive inference proposal serves

1240
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,000
to free us from a standard but flawed

1241
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
philosophical assumption

1242
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,839
about the nature and explanatory basis

1243
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,720
of cognition

1244
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,160
and adaptive behavior so that's the

1245
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,520
closing words of the paper

1246
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,960
and they come out hard with the

1247
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
implications

1248
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,640
of action on the bayesian

1249
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
computationalist worldview

1250
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,960
let's look a little bit about how active

1251
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,760
inference

1252
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,480
steps into that gap between the agent

1253
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
world gap and then also between the

1254
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,960
bayesian computationalist and then the

1255
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,000
more inactive

1256
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,200
and embedded approach

1257
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,599
so here's another quote from paper they

1258
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,800
write

1259
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,280
in active inference under the fep which

1260
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,200
we'll again we'll return to

1261
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,119
the generative and recognition models

1262
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,200
are best cast as realizing inference and

1263
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,920
control

1264
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,000
the belief guided selection of action

1265
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,440
policies so again

1266
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,839
more like cybernetics less like image

1267
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,119
classifiers

1268
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,119
and do not have the properties ascribed

1269
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
by structural representationalists

1270
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
again read them if you want to figure

1271
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,240
out exactly what you think they actually

1272
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
are talking about

1273
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,079
we thus provide a philosophical and

1274
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,240
information theoretic justification

1275
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,319
for an inactive view of generative

1276
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,240
models under the fep

1277
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,440
so if you read the paper

1278
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
you might learn some more details about

1279
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,800
why they argue that the generative model

1280
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,079
is an activist in active inference

1281
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,040
under the auspices of the fep but here's

1282
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
what they end up coming to

1283
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560
they end up linking these two states now

1284
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,680
i've actually

1285
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,359
not put any labels on either of these

1286
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,280
two nodes to emphasize

1287
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,160
that which the there's a wide range of

1288
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,000
relationships that the nodes can have

1289
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,200
because it's again a general graphical

1290
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,839
model and also it's just going to depend

1291
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,040
on the scientists and

1292
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,440
how it's being modeled um from a

1293
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,079
scientific

1294
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,240
instrumentationalist point of view and

1295
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
then if you're talking about organism

1296
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
and niche or organism and organism like

1297
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,800
improvisation

1298
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
then again it depends on the situation

1299
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,839
and how you're going to be

1300
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,520
measuring it so we'll just leave the

1301
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,200
labels off but

1302
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,480
the model that was like the one that

1303
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
goes

1304
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
from the um data like the retinal data

1305
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,200
to the higher order model model of the

1306
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,440
world is still in orange on the top

1307
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,920
and that's the generative model or the

1308
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,040
inference

1309
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,400
and then the recognition models

1310
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
are um actually this one might be

1311
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,480
flipped i'm not exactly sure

1312
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,240
but so sorry if the colors are messed up

1313
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,599
on this one slide

1314
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,040
but the key aspect is that inference

1315
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,800
is um what's happening from the data

1316
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,599
to the higher order priors of the world

1317
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,280
on the top in orange

1318
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
and so that's like a signal processing

1319
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,319
perspective

1320
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
which lends itself naturally to

1321
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,920
predictive processing and all these

1322
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,240
other

1323
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,319
things we'll get to and then on the

1324
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,359
bottom

1325
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,800
you have on the recognition models side

1326
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,920
you have control so these models are not

1327
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,040
just being used

1328
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,319
to recognize stimuli in terms of

1329
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,000
making structural representations of the

1330
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,440
world or updating them

1331
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,480
but rather in terms of their embodied

1332
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,680
and inactive control

1333
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,960
policies so because of this inactive

1334
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,359
insight or interface in the pragmatic

1335
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
term

1336
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,079
the fep frames itself especially in this

1337
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:14,880
multi-level

1338
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,480
embedded way as being something that

1339
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,040
integrates the two models by allowing

1340
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,680
for

1341
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
hopefully the mathematics to be

1342
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
partitioned the way that we

1343
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,599
expect and would hope that these kind of

1344
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,400
well

1345
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,319
behaved bayesian models sometimes can

1346
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,839
behave but also

1347
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,920
have all the richness of the inactivist

1348
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,040
perspective

1349
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,800
and be able to integrate these

1350
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,240
multi-scale models

1351
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,680
so we can think of kind of a few

1352
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,400
generations of the active inference

1353
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,359
development

1354
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,319
and just think what are the

1355
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,640
commonalities here in

1356
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,480
the different waves of the development

1357
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,079
and this is uh

1358
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,880
as per a recent discussion that was

1359
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,480
really helpful hopefully i'm

1360
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
representing it roughly accurately with

1361
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,000
uh maxwell

1362
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,560
and axel and axe and alec and uh in the

1363
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,960
early phrasings of active inference

1364
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,240
there was a local

1365
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,920
like a one step you can think

1366
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,000
expectation maximization algorithm

1367
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,640
so only looking one step ahead in time

1368
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,200
led to

1369
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,359
relatively local alignment of the model

1370
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,359
with the sensory data

1371
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,640
a second iteration or increase

1372
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,000
in the nuance of active inference came

1373
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,720
with this paper on inactive inference

1374
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,760
and others

1375
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
which introduced temporal depth and

1376
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,440
niche into the equations

1377
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,960
as well as things like planning and

1378
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,640
agent embeddedness and and

1379
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,680
the beginning surveillance and then in

1380
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,800
some of the more

1381
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,520
recent work like of 2019 and 2020

1382
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,000
there's

1383
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,079
work related to agent learning and

1384
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,440
affect and

1385
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,160
these sophisticated or counterfactual

1386
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,880
aspects

1387
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,280
of action and cognition and

1388
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,200
counterfactuals about belief

1389
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,720
um all the stuff that i really would

1390
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,359
love to learn more about so

1391
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,960
in the next and uh last

1392
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,480
part of this stream we're gonna

1393
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,200
talk just first coat of paint about the

1394
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,240
connection between

1395
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,319
a few different topics and a few

1396
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,800
different philosophy of science topics

1397
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
so the first set of topics the

1398
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,400
scientific topics

1399
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,200
are the bayesian brain predictive coding

1400
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,640
active inference and the free energy

1401
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,520
principle

1402
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,240
and then we're gonna see how these

1403
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,040
different

1404
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,119
frameworks or theories or principles or

1405
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,680
whatever they are we'll define them

1406
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,920
how are they all linked specifically as

1407
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,960
theories frameworks

1408
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,520
hypotheses and connected by

1409
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
falsification or other mechanisms of

1410
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,640
comparison

1411
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,800
and then on the right side is uh this uh

1412
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,000
meme

1413
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,480
and so on the top right this is sort of

1414
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,280
reflected

1415
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,359
uh to get the punch line first here too

1416
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,560
on the bottom

1417
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,839
um is a 2018 alias bulletin

1418
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,119
interview with carl fristin and our

1419
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,040
departed dearly colleague martin forger

1420
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,040
and in this interview there's sort of a

1421
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,680
philosophy of science progression that

1422
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
i'm going to walk through a little bit

1423
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,040
of today and lay out

1424
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,800
hopefully to clarify the differences

1425
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,720
between some of these different theories

1426
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,319
or what level of science are they really

1427
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,119
striking at

1428
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,160
and uh in this meme on the top is the

1429
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,839
essentialist and the positivist

1430
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,920
perspective so the essentialist being

1431
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,880
the idea that the uh objects or things

1432
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,839
have meaning

1433
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,400
in themselves not just as in relation

1434
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,520
with other objects

1435
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,160
and positivists being the idea that

1436
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,079
positive claims about

1437
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,599
nature are made through measurement and

1438
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,160
science then in the second panel is the

1439
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,359
utilitarian so defined based upon

1440
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,040
what they perceive their value

1441
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,720
functionally to be and then

1442
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,680
falsificationist

1443
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,960
which as we'll return to is about

1444
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,200
a theory that makes a prediction that

1445
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,640
would make it incorrect

1446
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,119
or make it uh untenable or increasingly

1447
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,400
untenable to hold

1448
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,000
and then the third panel is the

1449
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,599
pluralist and the bayesian

1450
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,680
and so in this world view there's

1451
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,240
understood to be a balance between

1452
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,280
novelty and conservation

1453
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,640
and that a somewhat optimal balance for

1454
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,920
certain types of

1455
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,000
ultimately utilitarian or pluralist

1456
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,079
views a certain value parameters can

1457
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,800
ultimately be

1458
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,599
struck but there's never going to be a

1459
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,200
perfect single value because there's

1460
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
still this question about values to

1461
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,119
bring to the table so not to take it to

1462
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,160
world modeling but

1463
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,520
you know you're thinking about these

1464
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
issues as bayesians pluralists

1465
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,599
and then in this paper fristen just sort

1466
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,960
of has an

1467
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,559
another level that uh almost merits this

1468
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,880
following chart that i'll show that

1469
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,440
really lays out again what the fep

1470
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,359
and the active are and how they're

1471
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,839
related to specific testable hypotheses

1472
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,119
because i know that's a common thing

1473
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:53,599
that people

1474
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,119
want to talk about so the green

1475
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,440
is what martin and i had asked we wrote

1476
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,680
in other words what is explained by the

1477
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,440
entropic reduction within the free

1478
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,200
energy principle that is not explained

1479
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,280
by any model parameters in the other

1480
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,559
frameworks so this was in an attempt

1481
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,319
to understand what a lot of people are

1482
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,480
trying to understand which is

1483
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,559
what are we getting above and beyond as

1484
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,839
a value add or

1485
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,480
conceptually or utilitarian perspective

1486
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,440
whatever it is just

1487
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,240
what are we getting by modeling this

1488
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,440
quantity as

1489
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,359
you've laid it out in these certain

1490
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,480
works

1491
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,599
and here's what fristen responded

1492
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,880
i think it is useful to make a

1493
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
fundamental distinction at this point

1494
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,079
that we can appeal to later

1495
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,480
the distinction is between a state and a

1496
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,520
process theory

1497
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,599
i.e the difference between a normative

1498
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,640
principle

1499
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,480
that things may or may not conform to in

1500
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,720
a process theory or hypothesis about how

1501
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,480
that principle is realized

1502
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,559
under this distinction the free energy

1503
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,319
principle stands out in stark

1504
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,000
distinction to things like predictive

1505
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,720
coding and the bayesian brain hypothesis

1506
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,319
this is because the free energy

1507
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,240
principle is what it is

1508
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,720
a principle like hamilton's principle of

1509
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,160
stationary action

1510
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
it cannot be falsified so that was

1511
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,440
obviously uh

1512
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
an almost inflammatory stance for many

1513
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
they uh fainted when they heard first

1514
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,319
then say that fap

1515
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,559
cannot be falsified it cannot be

1516
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,359
disproven

1517
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,040
in fact there's not much you can do with

1518
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,880
it uh that's you know the other

1519
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,559
choice sound bite right there's not much

1520
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,920
you can do with it oh well then what are

1521
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,240
we

1522
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,359
doing here right unless you ask whether

1523
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,880
measurable systems conform to the

1524
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,760
principle

1525
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,599
on the other hand hypotheses that the

1526
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,520
brain performs some sort of bayesian

1527
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,480
inference

1528
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,480
or predictive coding are what they are

1529
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,640
hypotheses these hypotheses may or may

1530
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,880
not be supported by empirical evidence

1531
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,359
so i'm going to just lay out this chart

1532
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,960
on this continuum

1533
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,440
to get at the distinction between all

1534
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
these different philosophy of science

1535
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,480
terms principle

1536
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,160
theory framework everything so

1537
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,280
this is going to be a continuum on the

1538
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,079
bottom on the x-axis from the left side

1539
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:02,480
being

1540
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,400
more theoretical or abstract

1541
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
moving through the scientific endeavor

1542
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,200
to the statistical and the applied

1543
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,240
so this isn't uh a ranking so much as it

1544
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,319
is a continuum just from abstract

1545
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,440
to uh practice based and individual

1546
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,319
people can

1547
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,720
can collaborate and exist across

1548
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,839
multiple layers

1549
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,160
of wanting to understand how this all

1550
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,520
works

1551
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,000
and as sort of laid out in what i'll

1552
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,559
present as a slightly clarified and i

1553
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,200
believe

1554
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,240
a little bit interpreted uh

1555
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
unpacking of what fristen wrote in that

1556
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,280
paragraph

1557
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,680
i'm gonna try to lay it out very clearly

1558
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,319
uh

1559
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,240
there's some gray area but i think this

1560
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,520
is just one way to lay it out

1561
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,240
so towards the most theoretical and

1562
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,119
abstract

1563
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,240
side we have principles which are

1564
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,559
axioms and invariances so these are some

1565
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,240
of the things that you

1566
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,280
can't falsify and

1567
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,040
i thought a lot a lot about that when i

1568
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,119
was thinking about what to

1569
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,280
say about this and one thing that it

1570
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,800
made me think about was girdle

1571
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,760
escherbach

1572
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,800
the 1979 book by hofstetter

1573
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,079
which is a really exciting exploration

1574
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,000
about a lot of these topics related to

1575
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,119
axioms and

1576
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,160
logic and also

1577
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,240
it reminded me of the law of

1578
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,680
conservation of

1579
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,599
stoichiometry in chemistry so not just

1580
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,520
the law of conservation of mass or mass

1581
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,240
energy

1582
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,680
but of stoichiometry and chemistry

1583
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,559
if you'll remember from taking a course

1584
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,800
it's about balancing the equations

1585
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,440
and so it's a rule within a certain

1586
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
framework of problem solving

1587
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,920
that equations have to be balanced now

1588
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,680
there's also a slightly stronger more

1589
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,079
general

1590
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,640
belief that there's a conservation

1591
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,559
unless there's a nuclear reaction or an

1592
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,280
alchemical

1593
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,960
transformation that there's a

1594
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,319
conservation of

1595
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,119
uh chemical elements that because

1596
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:57,520
there's

1597
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,440
such a strong conservation at the nano

1598
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,280
level that there's also some sort of

1599
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,079
generalized

1600
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,440
conservation at a higher level so that's

1601
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,680
a belief in a principle and that

1602
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,520
ends up framing what you see how you see

1603
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,079
it how you measure it how you compare it

1604
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,079
it tends to be normative which means

1605
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,200
using like a should

1606
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,720
or an ought like oh well this motor

1607
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,920
ought to waste heats relative to 100

1608
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,280
efficient motor so i think we can

1609
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,480
pretty much detach from the uh

1610
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,559
some of the emotional psychological

1611
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,599
baggage

1612
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,119
on that and just think about the

1613
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,440
scientific normativity

1614
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,240
and then what it actually says and then

1615
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,599
our response to it which is

1616
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,000
absolutely valid and important is

1617
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,599
something we can

1618
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,000
work with and grow from the principle

1619
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,079
doesn't need to apply to all scales so

1620
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:46,480
like

1621
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,520
the laws that say the patterns that say

1622
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,760
that the number of molecules in a

1623
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,440
chemical reaction are conserved

1624
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,000
it doesn't need to say everything about

1625
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,520
social interactions so they don't need

1626
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
to be at all scales

1627
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,880
sometimes they're sort of incorrectly

1628
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,319
called laws i'm just not really into

1629
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,760
thinking about

1630
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,440
nature is having laws i think laws are

1631
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
something that people make and then

1632
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,839
there's patterns

1633
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,800
in nature and whose last name you attach

1634
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,680
to which law

1635
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,920
is just wikipedia url bragging rights

1636
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,599
what matters is the patterns that we're

1637
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,040
discovering so again

1638
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,200
conservation of mass energy pattern law

1639
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,040
and this kind of returns us to this dual

1640
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,119
instrumentalism of principles like the

1641
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,640
free energy principle which is that

1642
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,319
on one hand it can be about the system

1643
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,319
like you can choose to model the system

1644
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:32,800
as

1645
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,280
neither gaining or losing energy or as

1646
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,119
always decreasing free energy

1647
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,000
or you could make a stronger claim that

1648
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,839
the principle is actually how the system

1649
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,480
is

1650
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,680
in which case you're saying that it is

1651
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,920
the system's functional principle that

1652
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,839
it is under national selection or it

1653
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,119
does follow the second law of

1654
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,799
thermodynamics

1655
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,720
all right so drilling down a little bit

1656
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,000
towards the scientific and the

1657
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,799
statistical

1658
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,960
a theory is a coherent set of ideas

1659
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,559
claims in logic

1660
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,400
and it makes specific testable

1661
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,160
hypotheses that are drawn

1662
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,599
from theory that's upstream and so

1663
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,520
that's sort of the confusing thing is

1664
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,599
from uh abstractness

1665
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,880
uh ranking the principle is the the

1666
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,599
ground uh

1667
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,640
the bedrock of the theory the water

1668
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,119
that theory swims in but it's more on

1669
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,240
the theoretical side

1670
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,240
so theory isn't even the most

1671
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,839
theoretical thing

1672
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,599
and then people say oh yes i do theory

1673
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,359
or something like that and that can mean

1674
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,119
a broad range of things

1675
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,359
from anywhere from the middle to the

1676
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,200
left side

1677
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,760
uh theory when it's partnered with tools

1678
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,119
and approaches

1679
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,200
is a framework also community of

1680
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,040
practice is important but frameworks are

1681
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,559
important too

1682
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,119
and the way that theories are compared

1683
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,000
is often

1684
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,400
through falsification or theory

1685
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,319
comparison so falsification

1686
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,280
is just like the best model in play is

1687
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,480
the one that we go with

1688
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,240
if there's some metaphor out there about

1689
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,599
hunting ducks or something with a

1690
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,119
shotgun i don't know

1691
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,520
and uh there's other mechanisms of

1692
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,640
theory comparison

1693
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,920
theory anarchy all these wild thoughts

1694
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,119
but um the falsificationist worldview

1695
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,000
that like we go with what works and then

1696
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,040
we

1697
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,880
end up having a paradigm shift and

1698
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,440
moving into a new set of dorms around

1699
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,599
a scientific topic like landslide either

1700
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:22,880
in a little micro

1701
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,119
sense or in a larger macro sense all

1702
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,160
this kind of stuff

1703
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,000
there's a lot of depth i i'm just going

1704
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
to briefly just say people have thought

1705
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,359
about these kind of theory comparators

1706
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,559
now in the alias

1707
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,680
interview response firstin mentioned two

1708
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,720
kinds of theories

1709
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,599
he mentioned state theory which he used

1710
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,640
to mean something

1711
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,200
pretty similar to a normative principle

1712
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,760
and

1713
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,000
those were about system states and then

1714
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
he combined the normativity with it

1715
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,480
being about the system states so it said

1716
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,200
that there was a normative stance that

1717
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,160
the system will

1718
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,240
conform to a certain way of being and

1719
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,520
it's about the states

1720
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
and that was contrasted with the process

1721
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,599
theory um which is about how

1722
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,599
systems change which is why it's called

1723
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,599
a process theory

1724
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,520
all right now to get to a specific

1725
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,720
hypothesis

1726
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,799
a hypothesis is a specific prediction

1727
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,079
about the system that's

1728
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,640
under the auspices of a specific uh

1729
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,640
theory whether it's a state theory or a

1730
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,920
process theory

1731
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,079
and a hypothesis is tested with

1732
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,040
statistical

1733
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,160
approaches it can also be explored with

1734
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,760
visualization

1735
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,799
so the hypothesis is tested

1736
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,440
from a falsificationist paradigm at the

1737
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,559
quantitative level

1738
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,200
so at the confidence level of 0.01 or

1739
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,160
0.001

1740
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,440
or according to this metric those are

1741
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,400
quantitative

1742
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,960
sort of in the trenches falsificationism

1743
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,640
of null hypothesis

1744
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,319
which is that there's no influence of a

1745
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,640
certain treatment for example

1746
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,880
whereas the theory falsificationism

1747
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
that's like one layer higher up

1748
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,799
is a little bit more um like logical

1749
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,400
uh battles being fought no single t-test

1750
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,839
brings down a theory but can take down a

1751
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,799
hypothesis and so let's

1752
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,480
break this down for the free energy

1753
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,000
principle specifically so

1754
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,400
as fristen had mentioned the free energy

1755
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,040
principle

1756
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,839
is this principle and i think in future

1757
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,160
times it would be cool to talk about

1758
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,000
what makes it a principle what are the

1759
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,760
assumptions what are the implications

1760
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,680
what are related assumptions

1761
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,440
and for now we'll just say that

1762
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,920
downstream of the free energy principle

1763
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,119
is active inference active inference is

1764
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,000
um a process theory it's a coherent set

1765
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,839
of ideas claims and logic

1766
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,319
about the world it is going to be making

1767
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,119
specifically

1768
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,280
testable hypotheses specifically about

1769
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,559
the structure of action

1770
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,640
and about how agents interact with their

1771
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,000
environment

1772
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920
and examples of theories that have

1773
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,880
overlap with active inference um for

1774
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,680
example

1775
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,319
licensing the use of the people who are

1776
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,160
structural representationalists

1777
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,119
using the bayesian brain metaphor to

1778
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,640
think about the bayesian brain as a

1779
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,799
theory we can think about the hypotheses

1780
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,480
that are specifically made by that

1781
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,960
theory so for example the claims might

1782
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,920
be something like

1783
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,760
at the first level that the brain can be

1784
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,440
modeled with bayesian stats and then at

1785
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,040
the second level like that the brain

1786
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,640
implements bayesian statistical

1787
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,480
algorithms in what it does

1788
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,079
in nature so that's that dual

1789
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,880
instrumentalism

1790
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,559
and then another area of theories

1791
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,200
that has overlap with active inference

1792
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,559
as well as the bayesian brain just

1793
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,440
didn't want to

1794
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,880
clutter it was predictive coding and

1795
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,319
two hypotheses in predictive coding

1796
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,799
are one would be sense data can be

1797
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,280
analyzed relative to now casted

1798
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,720
predictions now casting and the second

1799
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,280
level would be something like organismal

1800
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,119
sensory relays are predictive so again

1801
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,960
it's the dual instrumentalism

1802
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,920
where there's one level about how the

1803
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,480
scientist

1804
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,640
analyzes the world which is that yes we

1805
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,839
can use this framework

1806
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,240
to understand data even data about

1807
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,480
organisms or data about simulations or

1808
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:06,960
other

1809
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,200
systems and then at the second level

1810
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,559
it's actually the claim about

1811
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,440
the world and so in both of these cases

1812
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
their hypotheses because

1813
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,160
they are under an axiomatic framework

1814
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,599
reflected by the free energy principle

1815
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,119
that's why it keeps on saying

1816
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,200
inactive inference under the free energy

1817
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,799
principle

1818
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,440
and the active inference framework also

1819
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,319
draws on

1820
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,839
not just the bayesian brain predictive

1821
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,520
coding but just to label one more up

1822
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,000
there

1823
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,799
is there's this inactive area that we

1824
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,920
talked a lot about

1825
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,280
today and all the cool insights that

1826
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,640
the inactive side has to bring to the

1827
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,680
table

1828
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,200
so maybe another time we could think

1829
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,160
about what the

1830
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,400
principles underlying and activism are

1831
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
or are there fundamentals

1832
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,960
it's an air i'd love to learn more about

1833
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,000
are there

1834
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,799
frameworks for inactive inference i know

1835
01:00:58,799 --> 01:00:59,920
that we've had some

1836
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,040
participants on the active stream who

1837
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,119
had a lot more experience and practice

1838
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,400
with these kinds of things

1839
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,400
so we want to see how we can make active

1840
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,280
inference this

1841
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,400
hub for realizing the ideas and the

1842
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:14,880
people

1843
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,040
and the projects coming together to kind

1844
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,520
of make it real to show how these

1845
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,559
ideas are all connected and uh yeah

1846
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,240
see where we can kind of take these

1847
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,839
ideas just conceptually

1848
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,200
and from an impact perspective so

1849
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,319
that's the end of 6.0

1850
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,880
thanks for participating we provide

1851
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,640
follow-up forms to live participants

1852
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,760
it'll be pretty easy this one

1853
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,040
any feedback suggestions or questions

1854
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,640
would be totally welcome

1855
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,559
stay in communication with us and

1856
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,520
yeah the next uh live stream will be 6.1

1857
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,200
that is going to be on october 13th

1858
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,480
on the tuesday then we are going to have

1859
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,400
6.2 on the 20th that's going to be a

1860
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,440
follow-up discussion

1861
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
so if you're interested in 7 a.m pacific

1862
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,760
time

1863
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,039
for 60 to 90 minutes on october 13th

1864
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,920
or october 20th those are going to be

1865
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,599
discussing this paper a tale of two

1866
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,880
densities

1867
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,799
