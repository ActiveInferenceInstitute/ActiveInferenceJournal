172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
is everyone so cool let's go to

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
our warm-up questions and anyone who

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,520
likes to

175
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,759
speak can uh feel free to raise their

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
hand or jump in if there's no one

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
speaking yet

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,520
so the first question is what drew you

179
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
to this paper or topic

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
and while people are raising their hand

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,520
i'll start i think what was

182
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
exciting about this paper was about just

183
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,800
combining two

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
different schools of thought and

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
bringing them in together in a

186
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,479
constructive

187
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
way that was really super additive

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,319
rather than just choosing

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
sides what about you maxwell

190
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,639
um well so the motivation for writing

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,759
the paper in part

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
um was that i don't think

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,319
that at least at the time i didn't think

194
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,560
that what the generative

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
model business uh you know under the

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
free energy principle

197
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
is all about really i don't think that

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
was well understood

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,199
at the time that we wrote this so i i

200
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
alluded to this i think a few

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,240
weeks ago this paper uh the answering

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
schrodinger's question

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
paper and physics of life reviews and

204
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
the paper that we discussed the last

205
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
few weeks multi-scale integration were

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
all originally the same paper

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,039
it was all one big thing and we ended up

208
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,000
splitting it

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
into uh different papers to address

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,919
different things

211
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
uh so you know the multi-scale stuff

212
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
that we've been uh discussing

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
to address like the the scale-free and

214
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
multi-level formulation of the fep

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
and the the aim here was really to

216
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,000
connect uh the fep to other pragmatist

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,958
approaches uh the center act the center

218
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,399
on action

219
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
um and also to clarify uh

220
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
the nature of the generative models that

221
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
are at play here uh

222
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,080
which aren't just kind of brain bound

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
statistical models but turn out to be

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
something like the phenotype

225
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,040
of the organism

226
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,399
cool anyone else have thoughts on that

227
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,320
uh alex kiefer yeah thanks um

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
so i guess well i was drawn into the

229
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
debate because um

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
um uh some of my work with jakob hovi

231
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,279
was

232
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
among the uh the sort of target um the

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
critical target of the article

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
although maxwell and company were very

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
nice to us

236
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
and they didn't say we were wrong they

237
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
just said this doesn't exactly

238
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
generalize to the free energy principle

239
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
um so that's how i got drawn into this

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
and i continue to be interested in it

241
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
because i think it

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
i mean i think we've we've converged on

243
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
more of an agreement than

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,440
maybe existed at this time this paper

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,519
came out but oh yeah 100

246
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
i think i think we basically converge to

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
one coherent story at this point

248
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
but this is two years in the making so

249
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
yeah but but i mean the issues raised

250
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,839
here are still interesting to think

251
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,640
about

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
you know and i continue to learn more by

253
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
thinking about them so

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
awesome all right the second warm-up

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
question

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,839
is going to be what would be something

257
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
that you'd like to have resolved by the

258
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
end of today's discussion

259
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
so that could be a specific question

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,200
about how to apply something to a system

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,160
yeah lee go ahead

262
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
go ahead lee ah sorry i was just turning

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
my sound up

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
um so so yeah essentially um i

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
i guess i was drawn to this topic

266
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,720
because

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
um my journey towards active inference

268
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
has been via cognitive linguistics

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
so i started off looking into

270
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
relationships between language and

271
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
perception and particularly metaphor

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
so i think i've got quite a different

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
understanding of

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
what's meant by model uh probably

275
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,279
something more kind of

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
phenomenological and uh maybe epistemic

277
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
um and and i really starting to

278
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
understand that that's not what really

279
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,600
what is meant by

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
active inference so i've taken a good

281
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,959
look through this paper and i'm

282
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,920
hoping to build some kind of bridge from

283
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,519
uh where i'm at to more of an

284
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
understanding of what's implied by

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,560
generative model in active influence

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
cool well great because that's one of

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
the main topics of the paper

288
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
and stephen

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
actually just so just bouncing off what

290
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,600
was just said there

291
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,839
in some ways when you take metaphors if

292
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,600
you bring metaphors into

293
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,839
embodiment and has been embodied in

294
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,000
space

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
and around us actually then suddenly

296
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
that whole metaphor work becomes

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
actually almost

298
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,360
very close to what might be a generative

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,240
model

300
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
in a funny way even though it's

301
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
different so

302
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,360
there might be some way i'm actually so

303
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
in some ways i'm kind of interested how

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,519
this sort of becomes full circle

305
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
and can come back to these kind of um

306
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
kind of human ways of knowing

307
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,320
even though we've accessing it through

308
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,519
maybe kind of abstracted models

309
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
interesting and i think we'll return to

310
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,000
some of these

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
ideas if anyone else wants to chime in

312
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
on what they'd like to have resolved but

313
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
very interesting to hear about metaphor

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
as cognition and

315
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,639
how we can humanize our understanding of

316
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,920
some of these technical

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,800
or conceptual issues all right well if

318
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,600
there are no

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,639
hands remaining i'll move on to the next

320
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
slide so today we're going to be talking

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
about a tale of two densities

322
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
active inference is an active inference

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,040
which is a

324
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
article in adaptive behavior in 2020

325
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,680
by maxwell ramstead kirchoff and fristen

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
and in this paper they lay out their

327
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,880
goal

328
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
really clearly which i always love to

329
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,079
see in a paper

330
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,639
they write at the very beginning the aim

331
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
of this article is to clarify how best

332
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
to interpret some of the central

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,079
constructs that underwrite the free

334
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,000
energy principle or fep

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
and its corollary active inference in

336
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
theoretical neuroscience and biology

337
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
namely the role that generative models

338
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
and recognition densities play in this

339
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,120
theory

340
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,160
aiming to unify life and mind

341
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
so what are the two densities they're

342
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
going to be the generative models

343
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
and the recognition densities and we're

344
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
going to learn more about them and hear

345
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
about how they're related and discuss

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,279
different perspectives on

347
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,600
how the densities are linked and

348
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
specifically

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
the question is what is the tail of

350
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
these two densities it's alluded to

351
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
in the title and it's awesome that we

352
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,079
have maxwell

353
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
and alex and so many other voices here

354
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,279
to to make that

355
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,519
synthesis and that tale that we're all

356
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,040
telling together

357
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,160
realized so um in the

358
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,600
acting stream 6.0 i provided a little

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
bit of context just from

360
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
my perspective on some of these issues

361
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
if people want to learn more

362
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
about uh some of the background ideas

363
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,399
but for now

364
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
we're gonna just jump into the abstract

365
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,399
and at any point people can just

366
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
raise their hand and i'll just pause

367
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,519
right there and we'll take

368
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
a comment or a thought in the abstract

369
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,760
they begin

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
by rehearsing what i had just read that

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
they're looking to clarify how to best

372
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
interpret some of the constructs

373
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
underwriting the free energy principle

374
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
and those two constructs are the

375
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
generative models and the variational

376
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,959
densities

377
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
so those are the two densities and the

378
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
tail is going to link them

379
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,839
we argue that these constructs

380
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,199
generative models and variational

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:27,839
densities

382
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
have been systematically misrepresented

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,959
in the literature

384
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
because of the conflation between the

385
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
fep and active inference on one hand

386
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
and distinct albeit closely related

387
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
bayesian formulations centered on the

388
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,600
brain

389
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
variously known as predictive processing

390
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
predictive coding or the prediction

391
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,000
error

392
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
minimization framework

393
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,839
more specifically we examine two

394
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,639
contrasting

395
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
interpretations of these active

396
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
inference type models

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
a structural representationalist

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
interpretation and an inactive

399
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,800
interpretation

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
so we're setting up the two sort of sub

401
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,120
stories these are the tension between

402
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
these two perspectives that we're going

403
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,199
to be

404
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,920
looking to resolve under the fep through

405
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
active inference

406
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
we argue that the structural

407
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
representationalist interpretation of

408
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
generative and recognition models

409
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,959
does not do justice to the role that

410
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,560
these constructs play in active

411
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
inference under the fep

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,519
we propose an inactive interpretation of

413
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,560
active inference

414
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,040
what might be called an active inference

415
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
in active inference under the fep

416
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
the generative and recognition models

417
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,079
are best cast

418
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
as realizing inference and control the

419
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,759
self-organizing

420
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
belief guided selection of action

421
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
policies and

422
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,120
do not have the properties ascribed by

423
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
structural representationalists

424
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,600
so for this next slide i'll really

425
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
appreciate anyone's um

426
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
perspective or linking it back to things

427
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
they've seen before because i just

428
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
put it up there as a visual and uh just

429
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
a starting place

430
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
on the left side here we have the

431
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,279
bayesian

432
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
structural representationalist

433
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
perspective that we're just trying to

434
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
highlight the

435
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
features that are going to be most

436
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,519
simple to carry forward

437
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,040
and the bayesian structural

438
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
representationalist story is about how

439
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,240
data and another type of data which are

440
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,759
often called hyper parameters

441
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,560
are linked through a recognition model

442
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,199
that

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
takes data like sensory data and

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
recognizes it

445
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
and then going the other direction you

446
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,920
have the hyper parameters

447
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
that are generating sensory data and we

448
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
can also talk about why it's important

449
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
to have this generative step

450
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
and the outcome of this bayesian

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
computationalist scheme

452
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
is that there's a statistical

453
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,199
convergence of a multi-level model

454
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,199
that represents structures of the world

455
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
through something like expectation

456
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
maximization or em models

457
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
and we can contrast that with the

458
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
inactive paradigm

459
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
and the inactive paradigm is about how

460
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
agents and the world are related through

461
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
perception and action

462
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
and the outcome of the inactivist

463
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
perspective is an embodied

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
ecological action sequence really from

465
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,199
an embedded agent

466
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
who is enacting behavior and so this is

467
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,959
always the school of thought where we

468
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,000
see all the ease

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
encultured and embedded in all these

470
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,039
things and

471
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
they're um seemingly at least at the

472
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
first pass

473
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,079
up to two quite different explanatory

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,959
uh outcomes they seem to be talking

475
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,400
about somewhat different

476
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,079
aspects about the world and they

477
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,439
definitely link them through

478
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
different ways so i'm just curious

479
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
maxwell or anyone else like

480
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,280
what led to these two models being the

481
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,000
two

482
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
cities the two densities that were

483
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,160
chosen how does one

484
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
come down to just two why is there not

485
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
one or three cities and then

486
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
how did the bayesian structural

487
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
representationalist and the inactive

488
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
viewpoint

489
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,559
rise up as like the two kind of uh tier

490
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
one theories that we wanted to

491
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
find a synthesis between well so when i

492
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
got into

493
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
this literature um

494
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,640
especially from the the vantage point of

495
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
philosophy

496
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,679
what i noticed was the very very little

497
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
of it was technically rigorous

498
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,520
in the sense that you know a lot of it

499
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,880
was telling uh

500
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
like a story about how you know the

501
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
brain roughly performs bayesian

502
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
inference and then

503
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
uh you know kind of saying well there's

504
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
like a family of different

505
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
theories that do this in various ways

506
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
and grouping the free energy principle

507
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,760
under that i say uh you know uh

508
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,960
there was like a lack of technical rigor

509
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,160
i i want to emphasize that alex's papers

510
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
with jakub are probably the exception to

511
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
that

512
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,280
when i consulted alex's papers

513
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,000
in 2018 i thought well here's you know

514
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
some wonderful work

515
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,840
that is really taking the time to drill

516
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,480
down

517
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
on the formalisms as they're used to

518
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
study the brain

519
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,640
i thought that was great but i've i

520
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
spent a lot of time really drilling into

521
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,039
the

522
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,799
formalism of the free energy principle

523
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,160
per se and one of the things that i was

524
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,679
sort of surprised

525
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
to find out as i was learning the

526
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
formalism was that

527
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,559
although everyone is talking about the

528
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,960
generative model uh there are really two

529
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,080
models at play

530
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
um so those are the generative and the

531
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
recognition models or densities

532
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
equivalently

533
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
um i mean so first of all we say model

534
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
by model we just mean a probability

535
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
density right so

536
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
uh a probability distribution over a

537
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
bunch of

538
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
variables uh that are of interest to us

539
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
um and so yeah the the two models in

540
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,559
question

541
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,720
uh under the free energy principle

542
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
function slightly differently than they

543
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,720
do

544
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
in more traditional brain-based

545
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
uh so to step back a bit in

546
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,200
in machine learning and in statistics

547
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
a recognition model basically tells you

548
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,400
the probability

549
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
of some state given a bunch of other

550
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,840
things it's a

551
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
it's not a joint probability

552
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
distribution

553
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,960
um and it's it's used essentially to

554
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
recognize what's causing your data so

555
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
you're using it basically to

556
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
invert uh your mapping

557
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
i mean uh alex also if i'm saying

558
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
anything uh

559
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,799
inaccurate here just uh please uh jump

560
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,000
in and let me know

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
uh but yeah so there's basically in

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
traditional uh

563
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,720
kind of you know bayesian brain machine

564
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,919
learning architectures

565
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,760
the generative and the recognition

566
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
models are basically just the inverse of

567
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
one another so

568
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
uh the kind of top uh the kind of

569
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,159
bottom-up

570
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,440
pass uh is a recognition

571
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
uh pass it's a recognition model in the

572
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
sense that it's starting from the data

573
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,000
and then kind of passing through uh the

574
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,679
network you're able to infer what

575
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
must have caused your data and uh the

576
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
generative model is the inverse past

577
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
where you're starting from your beliefs

578
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,360
about states

579
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,679
and you can generate fictive data you

580
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,960
know based on

581
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
uh on this model and at least in alex

582
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,919
this paper is the way that

583
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,600
this uh well the this is how it was

584
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,640
described

585
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,600
as applying to uh the free energy

586
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,039
formulation as well

587
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,200
and my point in this paper was that well

588
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
this is a very technically rigorous

589
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
and accurate description of what's going

590
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,720
on in the bayesian brain

591
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
but these constructs have a slightly

592
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,799
different meaning under active inference

593
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,640
uh and to bring it back to i'm almost

594
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
done uh just give me one one more minute

595
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
uh to bring it back to uh these

596
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,600
schemas basically the so the recognition

597
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,799
density

598
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,880
is sort of like your best guess right

599
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
now you can think about it sort of like

600
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
as your posterior and your prior

601
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,520
so your recognition density is a density

602
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
defined over all of your states and your

603
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
parameters

604
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
and it basically tells you what do i

605
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
believe is the most probable value of

606
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
these states and parameters now

607
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
you know given uh my prior beliefs and

608
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,480
my evidence

609
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,600
your generative model to the contrary is

610
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
the point of reference

611
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
uh you know for the generation of free

612
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
energy gradients

613
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
so it's not your posterior it's your

614
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,520
prior it's sort of like it harnesses

615
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,640
all of the priors um especially the

616
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
priors about

617
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,600
your preferred data distributions

618
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
relative to which the free energy and

619
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,280
therefore the dynamics are defined so

620
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,080
you know you write

621
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,799
uh inference and control i think you

622
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,520
discussed

623
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
uh in 6.0 dan yeah the

624
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
so the recognition model is responsible

625
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
for inference and the generative model

626
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
is responsible for control you might say

627
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,120
so i'll stop there cool alex

628
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
keeper and then we'll go to anyone else

629
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
with a raised hand

630
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
yeah thanks so i i stopped myself from

631
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,440
jumping in i mean that was that was a

632
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
good summary um the only thing

633
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
the point at which i wanted to jump in

634
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
was to say well so the recognition model

635
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
isn't uh as con construed in these

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,080
bayesian brain theories is

637
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
an approximate inversion of the

638
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
generative model so my

639
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,840
my um if i have any complaint about this

640
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,360
paper it's that i think that there's a

641
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
a closer sort of conceptual connection

642
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,400
between the

643
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,320
generative and recognition densities

644
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
than then maybe the paper suggests

645
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,520
um and that i don't think you can

646
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
cleanly separate these things so

647
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
uh well anyway i don't want to launch

648
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
into this yet what i wanted to do

649
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
first was just address the the question

650
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,799
was sort of how did these two

651
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,200
visions sort of arise and my sense is

652
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
that what carl fristen did he did

653
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,880
a lot of great stuff but the main thing

654
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
he did that distinguished his approach

655
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
from the existing stuff in machine

656
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,880
learning

657
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
a lot of which was based on free energy

658
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
minimization uh

659
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
which i think he came to around the same

660
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,120
time as people like jeff hinton

661
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
but anyway he you know he added action

662
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
into the picture and he

663
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,039
pointed out that you can act so as to

664
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,880
reduce the surprisal

665
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
or the free energy cosplay or sensory

666
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,360
states uh instead of just revising your

667
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,720
gender degenerative distribution um

668
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,600
anyway so i think i'll hold off on on

669
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,520
arguing for the moment

670
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,279
awesome i i just want to say i agree

671
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,760
with you now uh

672
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
these two things do do not really come

673
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,559
together uh come apart sorry um

674
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,919
i mean it's really just an

675
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,400
implementation of variational inference

676
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
from that point of view and variational

677
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
inference and this is why it's a tale of

678
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
two densities

679
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
is that to do this variational inference

680
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
thing you need both

681
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
you need a kind of point of reference

682
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,760
that's going to give you the free energy

683
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
gradients

684
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
and then you need a sort of what is my

685
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,960
best guess as i am performing gradient

686
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
descent on my free energy

687
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
and yeah like i i don't want i don't

688
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,039
want to say that the two come apart

689
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,120
and indeed i mean i think you know in in

690
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,799
a newer paper that i've written

691
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
on this uh i basically just straight up

692
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
say that you were correct initially

693
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,559
uh it with respect to the recognition

694
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,000
density so the recognition

695
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
density it's fair to say that it's a

696
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,720
representation in the structural

697
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,840
representationalist sense that

698
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
you've been uh articulating in in the

699
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,520
series of really

700
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
awesome papers which you should all read

701
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,840
by the way i think

702
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,080
uh yeah where is the the the the one

703
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,600
point of disagreement that i think we've

704
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
clarified now is the status of these

705
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,960
generative models

706
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,880
and uh yeah yeah i'll stop there too

707
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
nice we'll go to steven and then anyone

708
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,640
else with a raised hand before the

709
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
roadmap

710
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
now one question i've got is in terms of

711
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,799
if

712
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,159
if these um kind of hyper

713
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
parameters that they use in machine

714
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,840
learning are

715
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,880
using a free energy is it that

716
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
they're they're just minimizing the kind

717
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
of energy expenditure

718
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,400
and the entropy internally and

719
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
and they're not using shannon entropy i

720
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,799
they're not looking at

721
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,360
how entropy is inferred or transmitted

722
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
sort of in a second order process from

723
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,360
interacting in the world they're just

724
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
minimizing it within

725
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
the kind of data that's being kind of

726
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,960
accrued

727
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,880
which kind of in some ways seems to

728
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,039
happen easily when you look at like

729
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,240
vision data but may not be so

730
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
easy to pass when you sort of look at

731
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
the whole body

732
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but that that question of entropy is it

733
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
that they use entropy in a different way

734
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,760
and they're not really using

735
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,919
entropy in the kind of um external

736
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,320
entropy of interaction but kind of just

737
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
the entropy

738
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
within the um calculations

739
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
in terms of there are two kinds of

740
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,679
entropy at play

741
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,880
in general right uh so entropy

742
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,039
in the thermodynamic sense is a measure

743
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
of how many macro states are com

744
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,720
compatible with a given

745
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
uh value of a macro state right so i

746
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
don't know your temperature is 36

747
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,919
degrees celsius

748
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,520
how many different macro state

749
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,440
configurations are compatible with that

750
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,799
so that form of entropy is one special

751
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
case of the broader

752
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
kind of entropy which is more or less a

753
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
measure of how flat your probability

754
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,760
distribution is

755
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
uh over your states so if you have a

756
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,840
perfectly flat distribution your entropy

757
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,200
is optimal

758
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
and um so the the entropy that we're

759
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,840
concerned with

760
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,679
is really the second type it's the

761
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
information theoretic entropy

762
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
but uh it's it's transpired over the

763
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
last few years that

764
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,000
uh variational free energy is also a

765
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
thermodynamic free energy you just have

766
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,919
to multiply by boltzmann's constant

767
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,279
so essentially yeah it's always

768
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,840
information theoretic measures but when

769
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
this is realized in actual physical

770
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,720
systems

771
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,039
it is also a thermodynamic uh free

772
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,240
energy but you know

773
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
the variational free energy it sounds

774
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
kind of spooky and esoteric but

775
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,679
it's really simple really is that you

776
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
have a preferred data distribution

777
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
and you have an actual data distribution

778
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
and the free energy is just a way to

779
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
quantify the difference between the two

780
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,880
um yeah awesome we'll go to alex

781
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,799
and then back to stephen

782
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,480
but yeah i was just going to briefly say

783
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
in in the you know the earlier machine

784
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,679
learning literature

785
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
the free energy definitely wasn't

786
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,799
supposed to be anything

787
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,840
thermodynamic or maybe that was

788
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
maybe that was an open possibility but

789
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
it was just a it was just a measure

790
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
as you were saying i think steven

791
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
between two internal

792
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,440
internally determined distributions it

793
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,799
was the top down

794
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,640
generative uh posterior versus the

795
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,159
approximate posterior

796
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,240
and um any connections to thermodynamics

797
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
are really cool but i think that's an

798
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
additional like very substantive um

799
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,200
question slash

800
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,240
thesis stephen and then anyone else who

801
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,880
raises their hand

802
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,440
yeah i think this is this is quite a

803
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,039
useful distinction

804
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,600
because i think that's where a lot of

805
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
the mixing gets

806
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
sort of caught up at the moment because

807
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,960
a lot of stuff has

808
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,279
been referred to in like the last 15

809
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,960
years around bayesian

810
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,480
optimization and bayesian stuff and then

811
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,760
where it's all pretty much as if it's in

812
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
contained in the data in the brain

813
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,440
and then now it's like try

814
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
it's like a reconceptualizing of that so

815
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,279
i think it is a big

816
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,919
big challenge for people to like forget

817
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,960
about what they've learned before

818
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,080
really agreed with that stephen and um

819
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,480
that's really what this conversation and

820
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
synthesis

821
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
is about is about bringing those

822
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,320
qualitative often

823
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,600
insights from inactivism and saying well

824
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,240
wait a minute

825
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
perception isn't simply the reverse of

826
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,919
action you know there's not

827
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,480
photons coming out of your eye so what

828
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
is different between perception and

829
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,640
action

830
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,559
but also recognizing that the world and

831
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,640
the agent have this sort of symmetry

832
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,679
and that they are linked so again anyone

833
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,039
can raise their hand but we're gonna

834
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,240
turn to the roadmap

835
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,720
and ask how the authors set up the

836
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
discussion between the bayesian and the

837
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
inactivist approached

838
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,679
and then ultimately converge towards

839
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,120
somewhat of a synthesis

840
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,720
and on the right side is just the title

841
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
page of the dickens

842
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,919
work tale of two cities so first there's

843
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,720
an introduction

844
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,279
sequence and then they talk about

845
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,880
statistical models as

846
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
representations and specifically they

847
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,240
talk about

848
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,159
generative models and recognition models

849
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,840
in bayesian cognitive science

850
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
as well as generative models as

851
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
structural representations so that's the

852
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,159
bayesian

853
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,000
structural and the representational

854
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
components

855
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,679
then they talk about generative models

856
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,679
and action policies which is sort of

857
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,880
opening the door

858
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,039
to this potential inadequacy of the

859
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,640
purely bayesian approach which is that

860
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,799
it's not action oriented

861
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
in the third section they discuss the

862
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,720
active inference framework

863
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,360
first they start by talking about how

864
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
phenotypes are conceptualized under

865
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
active inference

866
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,960
and about markov blankets and there's a

867
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
figure one which we've seen before and

868
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320
we will see again

869
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,399
about how markov blankets and active

870
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,399
inference are linked

871
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,880
they then discuss surprise entropy and

872
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
variational free energy which are all

873
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,279
terms uh perhaps not surprised but the

874
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,640
other two that we've

875
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
brought up in this discussion and in the

876
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
paper they really go into detail

877
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
a bit more about how these topics are

878
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
linked there's then a discussion about

879
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
how active inference

880
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,240
specifically links the variational free

881
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,279
energy with the inferential models

882
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,760
in section four a tale of two densities

883
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,679
they talk about how the generative model

884
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,840
and the recognition density are to be

885
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,799
conceptualized

886
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,840
under the fep and specifically they talk

887
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,360
about the generative model and the

888
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,559
generative process

889
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,600
in active inference in figure 2 they

890
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
depict a generative model

891
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,240
and represent it as a bayesian network

892
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
in figure 3

893
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
they talk about the same generative

894
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
model in active inference represented as

895
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
a forney factor graph

896
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
and the similarities and differences

897
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
between figure two and three

898
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,960
were probably going to go into next week

899
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
in 6.2

900
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,039
there's then a section on variational

901
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,279
inference and recognition dynamics under

902
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
the fep

903
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,279
in the fifth section they turn to purely

904
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,559
inactive inference

905
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,880
and they say first the claim that the

906
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,840
generative models

907
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,480
are control systems and so this sort of

908
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
borrows

909
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,000
on and builds on the generative model

910
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,360
idea which is a bit of a

911
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
computationalist perspective

912
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,080
as well as this control systems

913
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
perspective which implicitly

914
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
means action orientation because control

915
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,039
of action

916
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
not just control of theoretical

917
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,480
parameters

918
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
they then take the fighting words

919
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,679
section

920
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,440
generative models are not structural

921
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
representations i always like it when we

922
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,240
can

923
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
get down to specific claims and

924
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
negatable state

925
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
statements and uh just really being

926
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
specific because sometimes these

927
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,919
abstractions get pretty far out

928
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
there's then the final figure four which

929
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,679
depicts the action

930
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,080
perception cycle in active inference as

931
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
a generative modal

932
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,240
and a process and last they conclude

933
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
with some remarks

934
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,679
and the remarks also conclude with

935
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
towards multidisciplinary research

936
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
heuristics for cognitive science

937
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,760
and i know we have a lot of awesome

938
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,440
cognitive scientists and other

939
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
perspectives in this room and so

940
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,679
this is sort of our springboard where we

941
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,840
can take the ideas that we're talking

942
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,880
about here

943
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,200
and ask well how does this impact how

944
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
we're going to do the cognitive science

945
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
research what kind of explanations what

946
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
kind of predictions

947
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,120
what kind of experiments are we going to

948
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,080
do differently

949
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,519
how will our research paradigm be

950
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
different if we take

951
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,919
this approach that is synthesizing the

952
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,080
inactive and the bayesian approach

953
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,440
so especially cognitive scientists um

954
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,039
would be awesome to hear any thoughts

955
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
and while people are sort of collecting

956
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,480
their thoughts about

957
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
anything on the roadmap or prior in the

958
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,519
uh last 20 minutes here we'll have good

959
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
time to go through the figures and ask

960
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
about how they relate

961
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
to this big topic how are the two cities

962
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,440
linked

963
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
what is the highway that connects the

964
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,039
two cities or what is the

965
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,279
broader collaborative network that links

966
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,320
these two

967
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,639
any thoughts here on the roadmap

968
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,119
you you definitely laid out the

969
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,440
reasoning in the paper very well so

970
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,918
thank you good and uh these papers are

971
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
uh straightforward to layout because

972
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,119
they really

973
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,399
of almost a uh additive

974
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,960
way of laying out the topics first you

975
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
lay out the strongest version

976
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
of the other approach and actually it's

977
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,679
the

978
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,839
professionality and the clarity and not

979
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,599
misrepresenting another viewpoint just

980
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,119
to throw it under the bus or

981
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
to make a straw man argument it's it's

982
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,839
laying out the strongest form

983
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,239
of the um prior literature is what

984
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,440
allows us to build

985
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
another level of strength on top of the

986
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
literature rather than just cutting out

987
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
the pillars from underneath us so i

988
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
always well and i have to say you know

989
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
we started off with this

990
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,520
a much stronger position than we ended

991
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,240
up with

992
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,760
and it's it's by engaging seriously

993
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,640
with the arguments that alex and jacob

994
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
had uh prepared

995
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,920
uh you know with a few other people

996
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,000
paolo godzillski and so on

997
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
had been uh arguing for this kind of

998
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,040
stuff but

999
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,480
i mean thank you for saying that about

1000
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
the professionalism i really think that

1001
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,839
there is something to

1002
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,839
that argument and the whole point is to

1003
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
keep the baby you know

1004
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,599
uh with while getting rid of the

1005
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,720
bathwater

1006
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,599
uh and you know the baby is this sort of

1007
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,720
idea that there is

1008
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,480
something like uh representations of the

1009
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
external world that you know carry

1010
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,040
semantic content and so on like

1011
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,240
uh it's just that it's not the

1012
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,560
generative models uh it's it's the

1013
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,240
recognition densities that's

1014
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,760
that was sort of the tweak that we

1015
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,320
wanted to bring to the table but

1016
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,400
cool alex and then anyone else who

1017
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,560
raises their hands

1018
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,160
yeah so um yeah like like maxwell says

1019
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,720
we've

1020
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,079
had a lot of interesting questions about

1021
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,320
this um i guess the point

1022
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
the point on which i remain not

1023
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
convinced yet is that i think i still

1024
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,560
think of the generative model

1025
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,520
even in the fep as a representation so

1026
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
we can we can maybe talk about that

1027
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,400
um i think to me what this brings to the

1028
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,040
table and

1029
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,800
this is like transformed how i see this

1030
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,359
stuff is the importance of understanding

1031
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,760
the generative model as a control system

1032
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,160
um i just think you can do that in a way

1033
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,800
that

1034
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,079
also grants that it's a structural

1035
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
representation and that's what i've been

1036
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,359
that's still the framework in which i

1037
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,079
work um so i think

1038
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,839
there's another question raised here

1039
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,520
about whether the generative model is

1040
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,200
sort of encoded

1041
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,160
and um i do understand where where the

1042
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,119
authors are coming from

1043
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,160
um on that question and i think it's not

1044
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
so straightforward at

1045
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
in the fep as it would be in some

1046
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
earlier models like the helmholtz

1047
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,920
machine

1048
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,079
um so i don't know i'm curious to see if

1049
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,760
maxwell and i still disagree i have the

1050
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,720
sense that

1051
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
i maybe still want to call the

1052
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,160
generative model a representation

1053
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
um more than maxwell does but we can get

1054
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,359
to that can i

1055
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,079
ask um alex and again anyone can raise

1056
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,520
their hand and have a thought here too

1057
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,000
is

1058
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
what is the advantage of wanting

1059
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
something to be a representation or

1060
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
what is the alternative to something

1061
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,079
being structural right

1062
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,839
so i mean so i don't think in those

1063
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,599
terms in terms of the advantage of it i

1064
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,000
just think

1065
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,079
is it a representation or not i think it

1066
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,119
is based on what i

1067
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
our representation is and how this thing

1068
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
functions in this model so

1069
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,240
i know oftentimes people talk about like

1070
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,839
what's the explanatory value of

1071
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,040
talking in terms of representations um

1072
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,920
but i mean to answer more directly um

1073
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,400
what's

1074
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,839
so what's the alternative to it being

1075
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,800
structural that's another good question

1076
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
um in my view this structural

1077
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
representationalist paradigm really

1078
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,839
isn't anything new it's kind of just

1079
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,640
like

1080
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
the core notion of representation that's

1081
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,560
been at work in serious cognitive

1082
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,160
science since like turing

1083
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,720
so like if you go back to um you know

1084
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,680
papers uh

1085
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,119
like um there's a paper from 1980

1086
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,400
by uh alan newell on um

1087
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
sort of uh foundations of cognitive

1088
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
science and and

1089
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,839
he described how um what makes a

1090
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,400
particular symbolic um physical symbol

1091
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,680
system

1092
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,960
um able to uh

1093
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,480
get what gives it its universal

1094
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,079
universal computational capacity

1095
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,599
is its capacity to simulate other

1096
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,520
systems so i really think this notion of

1097
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,480
simulation is at the heart of

1098
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,079
what representation is supposed to be in

1099
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,240
cognitive science and that that

1100
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,359
that really just is structural

1101
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,359
representation and if you go back last i

1102
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,320
won't go on forever

1103
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,520
if you go to um cummins's early work on

1104
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,240
on structural representationalism um the

1105
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,520
s representation

1106
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,400
can also be read as simulation um so

1107
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,599
it's not that i think that you

1108
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,359
need to call it a gen uh degenerative

1109
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,960
model a structural representation i just

1110
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,079
think once you understand how it

1111
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,040
functions

1112
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,200
um i would say even under the fep that's

1113
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,720
like what it is

1114
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,839
but there's still a question about how

1115
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,520
it's encoded or whether it's encoded i

1116
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
think that's a separate question

1117
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
awesome thanks for that response we'll

1118
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
go to lee and then anyone else that can

1119
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,720
raise their hand

1120
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,400
okay so um so excuse me i was just

1121
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,520
trying to make sure that um

1122
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,599
i i was understanding terms in the same

1123
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,280
way that they were being used but

1124
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
alex you just talked about the uh the

1125
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,200
notion of representation of

1126
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
simulation and um

1127
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,160
you know one of the ways i've kind of

1128
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
arrived at active inferences is via the

1129
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,880
work of

1130
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,119
barcelona and perceptual symbol theory

1131
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,400
and simulation

1132
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,800
does that is is that overlapping with

1133
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,079
what you're meaning by simulation or

1134
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,480
does it have a different

1135
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
um meaning if you're familiar with this

1136
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,520
work at all

1137
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,680
probably i'm not i'm not as familiar

1138
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
with that work um

1139
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,000
as with um the the newer paper that i

1140
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,480
just

1141
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,119
that i mentioned i am and it is just a

1142
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:45,839
yeah

1143
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
great idea no just kidding i want to

1144
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,599
read it um

1145
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,880
okay i'll accept that i'll i'll take my

1146
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,880
word for it yeah i mean essentially uh

1147
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,040
especially these deep generative models

1148
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
or they allow you to

1149
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,000
entertain um well i mean

1150
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,040
the there's a sense in which the like

1151
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,560
the bar salute

1152
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,920
you know idea of metaphor is just what

1153
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,720
the generative models do uh you know if

1154
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,560
we're talking about a kind of

1155
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
loose associative structure that

1156
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,839
redeploys

1157
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,119
inferences about one domain in another

1158
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,280
i mean uh this is the kind of thing that

1159
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
you would expect a generative model

1160
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
would be able to do

1161
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
uh so these things are definitely i

1162
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,560
think strongly aligned

1163
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,359
uh in effect uh i mean didn't steven

1164
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,720
suggest something similar

1165
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,480
i think uh like the yeah metaphors are

1166
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,319
generative models in a strong sense cool

1167
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,200
notion will go to alex kiefer and then

1168
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,359
anyone else

1169
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,599
yeah so um that's interesting i don't

1170
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,359
know what to say about metaphors

1171
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,720
but um i i think the way i see

1172
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,599
the way i see this now is that um i

1173
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,880
don't think what maxwell at all are

1174
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,079
saying is at all

1175
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,400
of course um maybe not of course i don't

1176
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,680
think it's at all wrong but i just think

1177
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,000
that

1178
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,839
our the sort of the structural

1179
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,960
representationalist reading

1180
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,319
my view is that it doesn't quite say

1181
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,319
enough but not that not that it's wrong

1182
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,000
in any particular respect as applied to

1183
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,880
the fep

1184
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
like so so after further conversations

1185
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
with maxwell and also with um

1186
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,319
with michael and the other authors on

1187
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,680
this um

1188
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
it seems to me that you still have

1189
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,040
there's still a need for a

1190
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,440
sort of neuronally realized generative

1191
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,319
model

1192
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,520
uh in addition to considering the entire

1193
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,000
phenotype

1194
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
to be a generative model so if you have

1195
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,079
a fancy organism that can do

1196
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,480
you know deep temporal kind of modeling

1197
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,400
and plan for the future and things like

1198
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,520
that

1199
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,560
i think there's still a need for

1200
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,839
something that looks like a structural

1201
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,560
um in the brain that that is the

1202
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,000
generative model can be construed that

1203
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,800
way

1204
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,280
as well as there's this sort of larger

1205
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,359
more encompassing system and maybe this

1206
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,960
could be some somewhat hashed out

1207
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,040
appealing to the multi-level

1208
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,160
active infant stuff um but last piece of

1209
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,560
this um

1210
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,440
in discussions with with um michael

1211
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
kirkoff i hope i'm saying his name

1212
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,520
correctly

1213
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,119
we've never said it out loud to each

1214
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,040
other um

1215
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
it it seems as though he at least he is

1216
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,040
thinking of top-down

1217
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,280
sort of propagation of signals as a form

1218
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,160
of action

1219
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,280
so the stuff that we were saying about

1220
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,599
um

1221
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,359
top-down generative models might just be

1222
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,760
sort of a special case of

1223
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,400
the sort of action that this paper is

1224
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,839
talking about

1225
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,119
ooh before we go to stephen and then lee

1226
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,119
it really reminds me about alejandra's

1227
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,119
point one or two weeks ago about

1228
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,400
what are the similarities and the

1229
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
differences between the systems that

1230
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,800
can at least appear to do these deep

1231
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,599
simulations

1232
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,760
the counterfactuals like the brain

1233
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,720
versus a

1234
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,680
embodied phenotype the cell perimeter is

1235
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
not simulating other cell perimeters

1236
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
that's a little bit different than the

1237
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,280
way that the brain might be able to do

1238
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,760
something

1239
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,119
strategic so um we'll go to stephen

1240
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,720
and then anyone else can raise their

1241
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,760
hand

1242
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,079
[Music]

1243
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,880
yeah one one thing i always look at when

1244
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,000
you think of rep

1245
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,839
we talk about representation also in

1246
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,520
performance um

1247
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,560
it's to think of like re-presentation

1248
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,160
like is there another presentation

1249
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,800
in the brain which often people start

1250
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,560
thinking as a projection and then you

1251
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
start getting into this

1252
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
very visually dominated view of what

1253
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
our knowing is you know so whereas it's

1254
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,400
a bit different to reenacting or

1255
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
reimagining

1256
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,200
so like if i was to re-imagine as an

1257
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
engineer

1258
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,640
um a model and then i manipulate it

1259
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,839
in my brain well am i manipulating in my

1260
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,079
brain or have i reimagined it

1261
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,200
in my peri-personal space and am i now

1262
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
manipulating it

1263
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,240
actively in my peri-personal space

1264
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,920
and that is what i'm actually

1265
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,520
thinking of as a representation but it's

1266
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,040
not actually my brain at all

1267
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,119
it's just a re-enactment in space

1268
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,280
for me to then start to work with or if

1269
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,880
i do it on paper

1270
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,000
i think the mechanism for that is this

1271
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
is not quite clear but this sort of

1272
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
opens up that question

1273
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
cool lee uh

1274
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,040
stephen i think i understand what you're

1275
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,480
talking about but i

1276
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,280
are you just kind of um mixing up the

1277
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,800
phenomenological

1278
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,640
with the underlying ontological

1279
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,400
level so if you have a representation in

1280
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
the brain and you simulate it that it

1281
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,440
that it manifests in experiential space

1282
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,880
or perceptual space is that what you

1283
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,319
mean

1284
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,200
well to to manifest it in the uh

1285
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,640
phenomenological space

1286
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,839
is to enact is what i'm saying so

1287
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,000
it's not like it's in the brain then i

1288
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,760
project it into space

1289
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,359
it's like it's not in the brain it might

1290
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,040
be encoded

1291
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,119
like place cells grid cells all of that

1292
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,880
stuff with all the other

1293
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
stuff but it might be encoded in a way

1294
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
that can re-enact

1295
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,280
it but once it's re-enacted so with the

1296
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,000
work with

1297
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,720
clean language and micro phenomenology

1298
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
looks at like re

1299
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,319
embodying concepts in

1300
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,040
space around them so my kind of feeling

1301
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
is that a metaphor

1302
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,000
is kind of like our reading

1303
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,040
on our kind of affect

1304
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,839
and our kind of thinking our beliefs

1305
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,200
recreated in a kind of a physicalized

1306
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,680
way

1307
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,800
you know so we actually do like we

1308
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,680
i feel like i'm stuck behind the wall

1309
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
like i start you can actually ask people

1310
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,560
well where's the wall

1311
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,680
and they will they'll know where the

1312
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
wall is and what's it like to be stuck

1313
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,160
and where so suddenly actually find that

1314
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,440
they've actually got

1315
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,760
like a model but they never had that

1316
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,920
model before they kind of created it so

1317
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,560
the question

1318
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,079
becomes is it a reenactment a

1319
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,960
reimaginization

1320
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,800
and how much of that was already i

1321
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,240
suppose is the question was that already

1322
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,359
sitting in the brain

1323
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,640
ready to go or did it only come about

1324
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,079
through the act of reimagining cool

1325
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,359
um in our last 10 minutes it would be

1326
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,440
awesome to hear from anyone who hasn't

1327
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,160
spoken as well as just to flip through

1328
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,319
the figures so that we can see where

1329
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,280
we're going to be

1330
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
headed to do some technical unpacking

1331
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,480
especially

1332
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,440
next week so anyone can feel free to

1333
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,200
raise their hand if they have a related

1334
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
or unrelated point but in these last

1335
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
few minutes let's just try to look at

1336
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
the figures and hear some

1337
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
closing thoughts so in figure 1 we have

1338
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,319
the markov blanket and active inference

1339
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,640
and we've returned to this figure many

1340
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,720
times it's used across papers and it's

1341
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,200
really

1342
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,280
nice to see it again and again because

1343
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,200
the context is always different

1344
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,839
and the part that i underlined in red

1345
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,720
was um

1346
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,200
in graph theoretic terms the markov

1347
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,079
blanket per se

1348
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,760
is defined as the set of nodes that

1349
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
isolates internal nodes from the

1350
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
influence of external ones and in in

1351
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,160
this capacity it's really good that we

1352
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,200
had the discussion

1353
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,359
about integrating internalism and

1354
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,480
externalism

1355
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,200
because those are also sort of like two

1356
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,880
ideas that have this tension between

1357
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,680
them

1358
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
and the beyond internalism and

1359
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,720
externalism paper

1360
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,280
was about building on top of those about

1361
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,040
taking the strengths of those two

1362
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,119
ideas and then asking how they're

1363
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,119
integrated under act imp

1364
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,200
and today what we're doing and in this

1365
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,720
paper is about

1366
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,200
taking interpretations of internalism

1367
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,160
and externalism

1368
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,760
specifically this bayesian more

1369
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,359
computational perspective

1370
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,520
and this inactive embodied perspective

1371
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,400
and building on

1372
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,680
those strengths so it almost reads like

1373
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,640
a recipe

1374
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,800
for how active inference can be used for

1375
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,520
synthesis which is by identifying

1376
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,160
areas of tension in the literature or

1377
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,240
previously unrecognized harmonies

1378
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
between different ideas and then just

1379
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,760
asking how we can build strength on

1380
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,480
strength

1381
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,960
rather than attack strength to weakness

1382
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,839
or just

1383
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,119
um you know contrast weaknesses and i'm

1384
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,559
just going to continue just to

1385
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,720
show the other figures but i'll pause

1386
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,119
anytime someone raises their hand

1387
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,559
on figure 2 oh alejandra go ahead

1388
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,720
uh actually yeah and that figure um

1389
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,079
i can take again uh the question

1390
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,200
uh you mentioned um

1391
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,520
i'm still confused in terms of these

1392
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,920
generative models and their recognition

1393
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,040
density

1394
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,960
um in which temporal and and

1395
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,079
spatial scale um

1396
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,280
of course in each individual

1397
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,880
cell of the brain this this process

1398
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,160
is occurring and then in

1399
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,960
i don't know in a layer of the cortex

1400
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,319
and then in

1401
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,839
the the hierarchy

1402
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
of of the cortical layers

1403
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,559
and then in the whole brain and then

1404
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,760
blah blah blah but um so

1405
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,440
um belief updating is happening in

1406
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,240
each cell um

1407
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,800
i don't know if um

1408
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,079
if i'm i'm i'm getting to to

1409
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,599
to to the to the point but um

1410
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,640
the cells have to maintain actually this

1411
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,520
blanket

1412
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,720
contains also some beliefs that never

1413
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,480
can change right um

1414
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,040
so in order to to continue being

1415
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
the cell it is um

1416
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,440
um so um i don't know uh

1417
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,280
this this process of of the densities

1418
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,720
is is occurring

1419
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,800
in i don't know how many scales and

1420
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,520
yeah that's all of that i mean uh we'll

1421
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
we'll end up

1422
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,559
hopefully discussing this next week if

1423
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,559
it's if it's unclear i mean i have to

1424
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:16,960
say

1425
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,319
i don't think the figures are super

1426
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,400
useful in this paper uh they're mostly

1427
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,520
there to illustrate

1428
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,800
a few things what's really important is

1429
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,599
the equations um so i mean

1430
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,880
for next week dan i'll show you which

1431
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,720
ones in particular so that we can put

1432
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,440
them up

1433
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,400
uh yeah so uh alejandro what you were

1434
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,760
saying is exactly right

1435
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,440
all of these things are performing a

1436
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,599
belief updating and when we talk about

1437
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,079
behavior or dynamics or whatever

1438
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,640
it is all belief updating and belief

1439
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,240
updating just means changing the

1440
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
physical value of the recognition

1441
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,280
density at a moment

1442
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,880
so basically in this paper like the big

1443
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
kind of conceptual contribution that i

1444
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,920
tried to make to this

1445
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,319
literature is to say well uh with active

1446
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,319
inference we can rethink what we mean by

1447
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,640
embodiment and enactment

1448
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,200
so embodiment means encoding a

1449
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
recognition density

1450
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,040
uh so your physical body is a guess

1451
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,880
about the it's a posterior probability

1452
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,480
uh that you're you're constantly

1453
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,640
updating through this process of belief

1454
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,200
updating

1455
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,640
aka dynamics aka adaptive behavior like

1456
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,839
you've got this you we literally embody

1457
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,119
this this density uh the physical states

1458
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,240
of our body

1459
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,880
encode the parameters of probability

1460
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,839
densities

1461
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,839
this is like the this is the idea um

1462
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,000
and then basically the the generative

1463
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,160
model is just the point of reference for

1464
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,599
the dynamics that exists

1465
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,599
in the dynamics the way i like to think

1466
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,040
about it is sort of like dominoes

1467
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,160
falling over

1468
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,400
where the recognition density is the

1469
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,440
dominoes

1470
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,520
right each of these dominoes is like a

1471
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
posterior estimate

1472
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,680
you know and they kind of accumulate but

1473
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,800
the wave

1474
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,040
is the generative model you see like the

1475
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,319
domino wave

1476
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,520
itself that that the generative model

1477
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,640
exists in the same sense as uh

1478
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,280
the wave kind of you know making all the

1479
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,559
the dominoes fall

1480
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,880
and the recognition model exists in the

1481
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,000
sense of the the

1482
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,599
physical dominoes that are kind of

1483
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,800
encoding the the process as it kind of

1484
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,440
flows over uh but this will be i think

1485
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,040
hopefully clearer next week

1486
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,359
mathematically it's it's actually pretty

1487
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,440
simple it's that the generative model is

1488
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,000
the joint

1489
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,680
probability density over all of your

1490
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,359
variables

1491
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,599
and this this density doesn't exist in

1492
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,480
the brain

1493
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,599
it's not anywhere uh what exists is the

1494
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,240
the factorization of this density so you

1495
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,440
know

1496
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,960
you always see this in all these active

1497
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,800
inference papers it's like p

1498
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,079
of all of your variables so the data mu

1499
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,400
and all the parameters etc equals and

1500
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,359
then this long

1501
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,240
factorized which is basically uh it's a

1502
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,599
product of

1503
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,880
likelihoods and priors so this product

1504
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,680
of likelihood

1505
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,760
and priors is the recognition density

1506
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
that's constantly updated

1507
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,440
right and that's what exists in the

1508
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,760
brain

1509
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
but joint density only exists as a

1510
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,400
function of the dynamics it's like

1511
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,680
all of these part partial uh like

1512
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,319
carving

1513
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,920
ups of this density right this

1514
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,319
factorization they all move together and

1515
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,119
in their dynamics together they realize

1516
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,920
