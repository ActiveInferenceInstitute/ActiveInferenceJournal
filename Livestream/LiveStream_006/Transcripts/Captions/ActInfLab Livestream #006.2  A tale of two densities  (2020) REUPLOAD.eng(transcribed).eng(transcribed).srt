today just as a quick point of news our

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
friend and colleague jared tumul has

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
released a very

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
interesting blog post called spinning up

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
in active inference and the free energy

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,360
principle

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,400
a syllabus for the curious and it is

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
a great place for beginners as well as

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
for those who want to go deeper into one

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,759
of the

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,159
various domains that are touched upon by

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,759
active inference and the free energy

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
principle

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
so today in active stream 6.2

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
we are going to have a warm-up we're

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
going to have take two

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
on our intros as i kick out this other

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
alex

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,439
we are going to then come to a

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
discussion of the paper

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
last time in 6.1 we talked a lot about

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
the goal of the paper

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
and we went through the roadmap and the

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
abstract in quite a lot of detail

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
this time we're going to be highlighting

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
some excellent follow-up comments from

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
our participants

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280
we're going to be talking about pattern

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
versus structure metaphors

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,159
and more and then we'll go through the

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,200
figures

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
and make sure to talk about some of the

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
similarities and the differences

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,280
between bayesian networks and forney

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
factor graphs

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
great on to the intros and check-ins

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
so for this section please just

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,520
introduce yourself

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
and your location say hello provide a

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,560

i'm philosophy of cognitive fossil

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,239
cognitive science student and i'm

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,280
interested

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
in lifeline continuity and trying to

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,920
find a satisfactory definition

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
of what it is to be a living system and

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
i will pass

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
defending structural representationalism

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
about generative models today i don't

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
know

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
inference and i'll pass it

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:42,000
to i guess ale you haven't spoken yet

125

be alive and

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,880
maybe going further what is cognition

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
and perception so yeah

right now i'm also interested in

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
how active infrareds can help us learn

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,960
about the brain

156
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,319
and music cognition um as well as how we

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,120
can learn about

158
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
how humans coordinate in music or other

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
sort of group interactions

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
and i will pass it to the other alex

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
possible ways of integration

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
active inference with system engineering

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
and system

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600

funny technical glitches i'm also

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,280
recording this locally so

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
worst case we'll just be able to have

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
this uploaded let's get on to

176
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
the warm-up questions so for the warm-up

177
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,720
questions just

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
anyone who wants to speak would be

179
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
awesome to hear from you

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
just to sort of get started what is

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
something that you've been

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
working on or learning about recently

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
whether it's directly linked or just

184
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,360
something that

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
influences your mind state coming into

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
today's discussion

187
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,479
and you can popcorn in and also i'll be

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,080
watching the stack if people

189
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
raise their hand

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,599
i'll start while people are raising

191
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
their hand we

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
just had complexity weekend this past

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,479
weekend which was a really

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,280
exciting and interesting time about 100

195
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,759
people

196
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,880
from 37 countries and forming cool teams

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,360
on

198
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
different topics really learned a lot

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
mel

200
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
hello yep that worked great beautiful

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
um yeah so recently so i've been i've

202
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
been sort of puzzling

203
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,599
for a couple years now god it's been

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,800
that one um

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
over how to conceptualize on the free

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
energy principle

207
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
um and so that's pulled me into

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
work in philosophy of science on models

209
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
and modeling

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
so so all different kinds of ways of

211
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
conceiving of

212
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
formal models and what they do and then

213
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,039
kind of parallels in uh in

214
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
biology in behavioral ecology

215
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
and ethology and evolutionary biology

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,180
with with models that sort of

217
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,309
[Music]

218
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
having some sort of empirical concept

219
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,360
cool anyone else want to share something

220
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
they're working on

221
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
or i can also just raise the second

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
warm-up question

223
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
just in case people want to answer that

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
one which is what is something that

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
you'd like to have resolved by the end

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
of today's discussion

227
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
whether it's a thought about the paper

228
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
specifically or

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
something general um sure

230
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
fellow gitzer i'm not sure that is

231
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,040
shannon go ahead

232
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
hey um i wonder

233
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
whether the uh like structural

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,160
representation

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
that we might be defending later today

236
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,399
um whether that structure could just be

237
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
a set of attractor

238
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,480
dynamics like is that enough to be a

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
structure

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,040
um so i think

241
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
alex might be raising his hand to have

242
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
something to say

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
yep alex oh yeah i mean i was gonna

244
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,320
speak anyway

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
i mean i would say yes to that question

246
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
probably

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
um it's not just my opinion but um i was

248
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
going to answer

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
both questions i guess so um apart from

250
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
trying to figure out the free energy

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,880
principles still

252
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
uh lots of conversations with people

253
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
i've been trying to um

254
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
i've been working up to trying to

255
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
implement a variational autoencoder to

256
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
figure out how that actually works

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
so um been doing a lot of sort of more

258
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
technical work um something i'd like to

259
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
have resolved is just

260
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,040
to figure out exactly where um

261
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
in activism or the version of an

262
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
activism that's defended in this paper

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
is inconsistent with representationalism

264
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
if it is

265
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,200
um so like it's i don't need there to be

266
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
residual disagreement but i just want to

267
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
figure it out

268
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,880
ooh sounds good any last thoughts on

269
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
these warm-ups before we

270
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
jump into it we have a lot of very

271
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,320
interesting slides kate go for it

272
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,839
yeah i guess the biggest thing that i

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,600
want to resolve by the end of the

274
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
session is i'm still not

275
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,560
really clear on the status of the

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
generative model because at some points

277
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,079
it sounds as if

278
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
that's something that's almost causal

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
that it's controlling the animals

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
behavior or

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
the organism or the system's behavior

282
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
and at other points it's

283
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,600
a model it sounds more like it's a model

284
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
that we use to describe the systems

285
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,959
dynamics rather than

286
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
something that is including beliefs or

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,240
being causal and that's something i'm

288
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,519
still not entirely clear on

289
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,360
so i think that's a big thing i won't

290
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
resolve

291
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
cool all really interesting topics

292
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
thanks for sharing and we're gonna

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,399
jump into it because a lot of these are

294
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
on the slides ahead

295
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,079
so the paper that we're gonna be coming

296
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,800
back to today is a tale of two densities

297
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
active inference is an active inference

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,920
by ramstead kirchoff and fristen

299
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
and just to rehearse the goal of this

300
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
paper they aimed to clarify

301
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
how best to interpret some of the

302
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
central constructs that underwrite the

303
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
free energy principle

304
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
and its corollary active inference in

305
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
theoretical neuroscience and biology

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
namely the role that the generative

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
models and the recognition densities

308
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,120
play in this theory

309
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
aiming to unify life and mind and so

310
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,519
last week we talked about what these two

311
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,720
densities are

312
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
and we talked about the tail that

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
integrates the densities

314
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
we also walk through the road map how

315
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,560
they build from a to z

316
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
by talking about statistical models and

317
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
representations

318
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
introducing active inference and then

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
combining that with

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
an active inference in this sort of

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
inactivism 2.0

322
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
framework before building towards

323
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,880
multi-disciplinary research heuristics

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
for cognitive science

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
so that was last week let's get into the

326
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
new and exciting parts

327
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
so this was one of the feedback comments

328
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,959
from a participant

329
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
last week and what they wrote was a key

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
learning goal for me in building my

331
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,519
understanding of active inference is to

332
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
develop intuitive examples for the

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
critical concepts that can act as the

334
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
basis for abstraction later on

335
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
it seems to me like there is probably

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
something like a logical sequence in

337
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
which this should be done but i don't

338
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
necessarily always know

339
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
which concepts and ideas from active

340
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
inference to prioritize

341
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
as an example coming from a cognitive

342
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
linguistics background i tend to think

343
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
of beliefs as either causal reasoning

344
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
or the underlying sensory motor

345
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
simulations that connect to linguistic

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
concepts i've been trying to find new

347
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
intuitive examples that can help me to

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
understand beliefs as probability

349
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
distributions as clearly this is the key

350
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
for making progress in understanding

351
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
active inference

352
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
so my question for all of you is what is

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,320
a system

354
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,120
or a metaphor that helps you understand

355
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
active inference and why

356
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
and while people are raising their hand

357
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
on the bottom we have just a few of the

358
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
systems that we've been discussing

359
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
over the last weeks we have a brain the

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
technical and the artistic parts of the

361
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
brain we have

362
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
insect colonies we have dance and

363
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,079
embodiment and movement

364
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,600
and then on the right i guess it

365
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
reflects something like the economy or

366
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
changes in dynamical systems but what is

367
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,839
a system

368
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
that helps you understand through

369
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,360
specifics

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:48,639
something about active inference

371
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,920
any thoughts on this

372
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
i mean i hate to be that guy but like i

373
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,160
started

374
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,519
understanding active inference when i

375
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
went into the math

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
uh like it's it's a formal theory and i

377
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
i think we can actually be misled by

378
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
uh metaphor uh

379
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,440
yeah uh some of my some of my

380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
reservations about the philosophical

381
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,720
work that's been done on active

382
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
inference is that

383
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
it it operates on the basis of you know

384
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
uh kind of unformal

385
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
intuitive conceptual understandings

386
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
rather than trying to

387
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,959
see what the math that says so i hate to

388
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,160
be that guy though

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
no that's perfect we'll go to alex

390
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
bjotkin and then to

391
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
kate go ahead alex

392
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,199
yeah for me most important changed

393
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,600
my views was taking seriously

394
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
approach from like for process

395
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,190
and understanding

396
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,839
[Music]

397
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
concepts about states and steady states

398
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,839
of possible processes and the later on

399
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
all this concept with a markov blanket

400
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,880
as a border

401
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
and underlying structure like

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
generative models in links with

403
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,120
cybernetics it's bringing me

404
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
some kind of top-level picture and now

405
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
i'm trying to

406
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
focus on different parts to have more

407
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,759
detailed understanding

408
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
cool kate and then mel

409
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
yeah i was also going to say cybernetics

410
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
i think i only really started to

411
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,560
understand what was going on once i

412
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
started seeing the links with like ashby

413
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,959
and account of survival as stability

414
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
um that was when things started to make

415
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,079
sense for me um

416
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,199
and there's also just like a nice

417
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
metaphor i quite liked and i think it's

418
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,240
really

419
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
it's a paper by ellie rudenberg i think

420
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,399
with the union kingston

421
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
rightfeld with the crooked scientist

422
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
metaphor the way the scientist is trying

423
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
to

424
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,720
obtain the result that it's looking for

425
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
so it has to have some sort of

426
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
latch on the world in order to bring

427
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,079
about that result but it's still trying

428
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,040
to obtain

429
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
the result that it wants in the first

430
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,800
place rather than passively

431
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
find out what will happen i thought it

432
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
was quite a nice metaphor

433
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
so do you think they are helpful cool

434
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
mel

435
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
so i remember i'm i'm remembering um

436
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,759
my first sort of aha moment with the fpp

437
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,720
and active entrance

438
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,079
um i was i was explaining this stuff

439
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,040
to my friend who works on on similar

440
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
things but in a very different framework

441
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
um in the mit media lab and we had like

442
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,759
papers

443
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
strewn everywhere and scribbling all of

444
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,880
them and

445
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,199
my realization in explaining this

446
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
framework to him was that

447
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,680
um that there is

448
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
fundamentally at the at the lowest level

449
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,959
at the

450
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,560
at the level of the simplest sort of

451
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
systems or at their

452
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,839
kind of lowest scale right um

453
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,199
no difference between belief

454
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,559
updating and action so

455
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,199
a a change in the system is a change in

456
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
the system

457
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,559
right and that is both

458
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,480
a belief update and an action right

459
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
um and once you build in

460
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,119
further levels of of hierarchical

461
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,160
organization and complexity you get this

462
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
strong differentiation between them but

463
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
at the lowest level of this the same

464
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,000
thing

465
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
[Music]

466
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
cool and kate did you know that's a

467
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
probability

468
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,840
okay had you raised your hand there and

469
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,559
also i'm just

470
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,160
going to yeah alex kiefer go ahead

471
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
oh um yeah i mean i was gonna

472
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
that's i like that point that at least

473
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,039
at the lowest level we'll leave updating

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,720
an action or kind of

475
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,039
same thing i guess um that's one reason

476
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,720
that's one reason that i'm skeptical

477
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
that we need to explicitly i think

478
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,679
implicitly

479
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,520
more traditional bayesian brain stories

480
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
kind of

481
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
are built on that claim as well but um i

482
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
was going to say what got me into what

483
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
got me into active inference also

484
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
sort of a technical point was just that

485
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
you really can't you can't optimize the

486
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
thing you can't minimize surprisal

487
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,600
just by ingesting adjusting and

488
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
at least not okay the surprise depends

489
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,559
in part on the sensory observations

490
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
right so you can't minimize that

491
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
just by changing your generative model

492
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
um you have to

493
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
change the observations so that's that's

494
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
the technical thing that got me into it

495
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,039
um cool and yeah

496
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,280
thanks everyone for being flexible and

497
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
fun on the tech maxwell i really

498
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
agree that the metaphor as always with

499
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
metaphors it's a question about

500
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
compression of semantics and meaning and

501
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
at the end of the day we're talking

502
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,120
about something specific

503
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
and so we can think about different

504
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
systems that help us understand

505
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
how active inference is deployed in the

506
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
real world but often metaphors will take

507
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,600
off

508
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
take us off the mark uh because it

509
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
removes us from the real

510
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,000
underlying details so let's return and

511
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,679
the details are really where the devil's

512
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,320
at

513
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,520
uh in this case uh i think

514
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
but yep i i agree we're hopefully in the

515
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
end with the figures we're gonna be able

516
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
to look at those details really

517
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
specifically and i think that the way

518
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
that figure two three and four

519
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
lead into each other helped me

520
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
understand a lot about the system

521
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
so just to take another look at these

522
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,720
two

523
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,799
cities the two cities that are being

524
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
linked the densities

525
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
on the left we have the bayesian

526
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
structural representationalist

527
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
and alex freely added any details here

528
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
but bayesian models move between the

529
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
data parameters the observations and

530
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
hyper parameters or higher order

531
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
parameters and

532
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
from the data to the hyper parameters we

533
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
call it a recognition

534
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,200
model and to go from hyper parameters to

535
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
a set of data or observations that is a

536
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,960
generative model

537
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
and the outcome is a statistical

538
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,200
convergence of a multi-level model that

539
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
represents structures of the world

540
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
for example through an expectation

541
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,120
maximization scheme

542
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,080
we can contrast this with the inactivist

543
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
school of thought

544
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,159
which has linked rather than data and

545
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,960
hyper data

546
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
but rather has focused on the world and

547
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
agents and how they're linked through

548
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
perception and action

549
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,760
so a lot more adjacencies to areas like

550
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
niche construction

551
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
and ecological psychology and we

552
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
remember hearing from maxwell last week

553
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,919
about how it was the desire to

554
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,760
mathematically rigorize

555
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,559
some of the inactivism that led him to

556
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
the bayesian approach

557
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
and let's now think about how these two

558
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
densities are linked with a little bit

559
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,440
more feedback from one of our

560
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,320
participants they wrote the domino

561
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
metaphor finally makes sense

562
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
the physical dominoes are the physical

563
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,919
state of the system

564
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
corresponding to the recognition model

565
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,919
and the falling of the dominoes

566
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,000
is like the process or the dynamics of

567
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
the system reflecting the generative

568
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
model so here we've kind of combined

569
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,440
these two

570
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
different ways of thinking and we're

571
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,799
looking at the relationship

572
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,960
of the world and the agent or the system

573
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
and the system surroundings

574
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
and directly went ahead and combined

575
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,440
perception with the recognition model

576
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,000
and action with the generative model and

577
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,159
then also just to combine that with what

578
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,600
kate was just talking about with

579
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
cybernetics

580
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,679
this is a quote from the paper that says

581
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,200
on this view active inference can be

582
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
read as a new take on the good regulator

583
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
theorem proposed by content and rosh

584
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
ashby in 1970.

585
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,559
active inference tells us about the

586
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,480
relation between a control system

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
the generative model with priors over

588
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,760
action policies

589
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,600
and a system being controlled the

590
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,679
organism and its adaptive behavior

591
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,159
the actual actions undertaken in and

592
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
part of the world

593
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
so what what exactly does this clarify

594
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,760
about active inference

595
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,880
or what do people think about this

596
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,919
metaphor um or at least way to think

597
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,200
about how

598
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
if not necessarily a metaphor how would

599
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
we apply active inference to this

600
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
system what are we getting at here with

601
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,640
these similarities and differences

602
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
between the two

603
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
models

604
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,120
sure mel well so the good regulator

605
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,159
theorem the idea

606
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
is that um any good

607
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
control structure for some larger system

608
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,280
has to be a model of that system it has

609
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,799
to contain

610
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,799
in it all of the the key variables

611
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
for that system and basically what this

612
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,799
says to me about

613
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
active inference is that um in order for

614
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,320
a system in an environment

615
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,600
to be able to adequately react

616
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
to whatever kinds of perturbations are

617
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
happening in the environment

618
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,440
it has to contain all of the key

619
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
existence i call them existential

620
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,039
variables

621
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,039
the the variables in the environment

622
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
that would lead to the system

623
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
continuing to exist or not continuing to

624
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
place

625
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,039
cool and so how exactly i'm just curious

626
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,840
um does the system come to embody all

627
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
the key variables of the outside world

628
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,640
like don't the models of the organism

629
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,240
reflect a simplified

630
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,799
version of the outside world otherwise

631
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,840
there kind of is a

632
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
abortion story about the map that

633
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
represents the territory exactly so how

634
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
does a good regulator arise in the

635
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
context of an environment like that

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
um shannon and then maxwell

637
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
well i don't think the key is to be an

638
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,640
exact

639
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
like imitative model of the world or an

640
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
exact map even of the world

641
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,039
but just a model that is good enough to

642
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,000
enable you to

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
act and adjust in the world

644
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
cool maxwell and then mel

645
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,400
yeah i mean so formally speaking there's

646
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,279
a difference between

647
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,840
external states and hidden states um

648
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
and i mean when everything is going well

649
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
uh the external states that are modeled

650
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
by the system coincide with

651
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
the hidden states that are actually out

652
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,559
there

653
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,679
um and this is more of this it's not

654
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,320
i'm not i'm not sure if it's guaranteed

655
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,200
but

656
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,840
it it is strongly implied by the fact

657
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,279
that we're minimizing

658
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,880
uh variational free energy uh

659
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
that you know if if we're if we're not

660
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,559
generating a lot of

661
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,679
free energy then uh the external beliefs

662
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,240
that we have

663
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,559
about the environment tend to reflect uh

664
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,840
you know the causal structure of that

665
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
environment

666
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,679
but i mean manuel baltierri and chris

667
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
buckley have done some interesting work

668
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,720
showing that actually

669
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,799
the there isn't a necessary kind of

670
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,840
entailment relation

671
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
um you can have uh

672
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,000
you can have the the system can be

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
acting

674
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,000
that don't actually exist and i mean

675
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
this makes sense also

676
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
just evolutionarily uh perceptual

677
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
systems don't track truth they enable

678
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,360
adaptive

679
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,320
uh behavioral loops so if you're a prey

680
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
item like a bunny

681
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,919
it's adaptive to generate a lot of false

682
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,039
positives

683
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,240
uh compared to you know allowing for

684
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,720
false negatives and in terms of like

685
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,919
predator detection

686
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,159
it's it's more advantageous to you know

687
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,039
make a few

688
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,200
less costly mistakes than make a big one

689
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
so um

690
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
i mean yellow brinenberg and eric rivel

691
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
make make that point in the uh paper

692
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
that kate was

693
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,600
mentioning just earlier but uh yeah the

694
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
it doesn't actually have to hook up to

695
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,039
anything

696
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
in the real world though usually it will

697
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
end up doing so

698
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
cool mel and sasha

699
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,360
yeah so the the key term in what i've

700
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,000
said is

701
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,279
is key actually um so the key variables

702
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
right that's that's just what keeps the

703
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:08,960
system alive

704
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
can imagine that we first get a system

705
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
on the scene

706
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,760
that needs just basically one

707
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,880
parameter in its environment to be

708
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,960
correct in order to continue to exist as

709
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
a system

710
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
and then we build up from there to

711
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,840
systems that are progressively

712
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
more and more complex and need

713
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
progressively more and more

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
complex sort of environmental scenarios

715
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,279
to survive and then they themselves in

716
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,799
order to survive in those

717
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
more complex regimes need to build in

718
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,559
complexity

719
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,200
right in in terms of their their the

720
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,760
models

721
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
of the world that they enact right and i

722
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,799
think that says something

723
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,840
interesting about um how we

724
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,640
conceptualize uh

725
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
cognition and the onset of cognitive

726
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,080
complexity

727
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
um as sort of um and this is

728
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
peter garcia smith's line on the subject

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,480
is

730
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,840
is it's a response to a complexifying

731
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,600
environmental circumstance

732
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,120
right cool sasha then alex keefer

733
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
um yeah uh one key phrase that really

734
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,520
helped me

735
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
better understand um active inference

736
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
um is uh good enough and

737
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,600
that's what really um kind of put it all

738
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,399
together that

739
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,640
um while we're going about and reducing

740
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
uncertainty

741
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,000
about our system it just has to be good

742
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
enough to make the next

743
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,080
action or in the evolutionary sense to

744
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,960
survive

745
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,159
and that metaphor has really helped me

746
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,600
uh go through all this um all these high

747
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,559
level concepts

748
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,120
so thank you for mentioning that alex

749
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,679
kieffer

750
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,799
then alex fiatkin thanks um

751
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,799
yeah i just wanted to just note that

752
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
there's there's you don't need

753
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,760
to contrast accuracy or you know

754
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,200
answerable to the truth-ness with um

755
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
enabling adaptive behavior uh as as like

756
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,559
a dichotomy

757
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,760
um i'm not sure if that's what was

758
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
intended or not but this one reason i've

759
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
had trouble getting into

760
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,080
understanding the uh sort of

761
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,480
anti-representationalist

762
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
viewpoint is that um you know structural

763
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
similarity is a matter of degree

764
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
accuracy is a matter of degree in this

765
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
sense so um

766
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
i mean yes your hidden state

767
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
representation doesn't have to map

768
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,559
completely

769
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,159
accurately onto reality doesn't have to

770
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,000
capture every detail but if it doesn't

771
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,279
do that to any degree

772
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
um you're screwed so you know um maybe

773
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:34,960
we need

774
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,240
systematically um sort of simpler or

775
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
biased representations in order to do

776
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
the job but i think there's still a

777
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,480
implied relationship to the truth

778
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,640
there cool alex

779
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,399
yeah thanks uh i want to change

780
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,760
the system's level of consideration of

781
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
possible application of active inference

782
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,039
and for me interesting

783
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,200
on a personal level in terms of

784
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
day phenomenology and especially

785
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
professional and or a working day

786
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,760
phenomenology

787
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,880
how it works what is a generative model

788
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
and like an example

789
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,240
and what i won't discuss if i get it

790
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,120
correctly or

791
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,600
how it's good possible develop to think

792
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,279
about it

793
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
but if for example some doctor

794
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
he know different disciplines

795
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,000
and with different ontologies

796
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,279
and when he met a patient he

797
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,320
started his actions by his generative

798
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,080
model which activates with

799
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,120
recognition models to serve

800
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,399
as a doctor depends on exact situation

801
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
and exact case

802
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,080
and if it's so from for example from

803
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,880
another

804
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,159
level from team level if person

805
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,799
uh behave professionally in some

806
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,679
discipline

807
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,200
it became like a

808
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
perception model for a generative model

809
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
of the team

810
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,520
and what does it mean in terms of

811
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
learning and education of team members

812
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,799
because

813
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,919
if we can how

814
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,720
some in some way to link recognition

815
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,480
models with ontologies

816
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,919
and starting to work with it more again

817
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
cybernetically it's possible could be

818
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,360
very interesting

819
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,480
at least for me cool agreed the the

820
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
ontologies that how we think about the

821
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
world

822
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,480
definitely influences our perception

823
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
and sasha do you have something else

824
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,000
otherwise okay shannon go ahead

825
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
um i was just going back to alex

826
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
keefer's point that

827
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,440
your model like there has to be some

828
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,039
truth relationship with the world and if

829
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,320
we're going

830
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
to the dominoes and the process needs to

831
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
be that the fall to make some cool

832
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,279
pattern

833
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,000
if there's an interruption like so now

834
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,360
this domino can't reach

835
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,159
the next domino like that's akin to a

836
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,440
disruption and

837
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,480
how truthy the model is of the world

838
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,960
and it disrupts the action that you're

839
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
able to take or it disrupts the

840
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,559
um you die instead of being able to

841
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,200
survive

842
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,519
because your model isn't accurate at

843
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
that stage for the processes

844
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,760
to continue happening to do the next

845
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
action or to

846
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,480
survive cool cool discussion

847
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,080
on this domino system let's talk about

848
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
counter factuals and also return to some

849
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
of the great questions alejandra raised

850
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
in previous

851
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,640
weeks this is from another participant's

852
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,159
feedback they wrote

853
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,080
what i'd like to clarify if possible is

854
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,840
the following am i right in

855
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
understanding the generative model as a

856
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
control system that is dynamically

857
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,559
instantiated between

858
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,320
an organism and an affordance in the

859
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,880
context and the recognition density as a

860
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,679
relation

861
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,279
between the sensory inputs and the

862
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
possibilities for action policies

863
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
encoded in the organism

864
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
if so how does this work when action is

865
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,240
instantiated by counterfactual

866
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
forms of cognition or simulation i.e

867
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,640
those that do not rely on affordances in

868
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,720
the current external context

869
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
and so on the bottom right there's a a

870
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,159
younger person

871
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,000
looking into the mirror or maybe vice

872
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
versa and seeing an older

873
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
person and this is reflecting how not

874
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,159
only is there a deep temporal aspect

875
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,720
to our action in the current moment

876
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
meaning that there's often affordances

877
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
that aren't available to us at the

878
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,799
second that we're

879
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,039
actually making the decision but also

880
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,200
that we think about future possible

881
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,799
affordances that don't exist

882
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,399
based upon the sensory data that we're

883
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
getting or do they

884
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
and then on the right side i have a few

885
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,399
bacteria because this is like an example

886
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,919
of a system that we might not think of

887
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,000
as having a simulation or

888
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,679
counterfactual based mechanism of action

889
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
often bacterial behavior can be

890
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
summarized quite concisely by just the

891
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,240
short term

892
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,000
gradients that it's ascending or

893
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,880
descending so for anyone to

894
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,279
raise their hand and chime in how how do

895
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,279
counterfactuals play into this

896
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,080
and how do we make sense of affordances

897
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
that aren't in a current ecosystem

898
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,840
but are still important for behavior

899
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
maxwell

900
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,640
well i just want to comment on the first

901
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
part of that question

902
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,120
um so i mean i think it's a bit simpler

903
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,600
than that

904
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,279
in terms of the relationship between the

905
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,279
recognition and the generative

906
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,399
models or densities um so your

907
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,559
recognition model is just your post

908
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
your posterior the all of your

909
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,399
posteriors basically all of the

910
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,799
all of your posterior estimates over

911
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,840
states

912
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,519
and precisions it's like my best guess

913
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,919
as to you know what the value of all

914
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
these states are

915
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,120
um and i mean

916
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,080
you can think of that as uh the system's

917
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,720
current

918
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,159
physical state so under under the active

919
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,520
inference um

920
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
formalism the current physical state

921
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,079
of the organism encodes uh

922
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,399
basically the the specific parameters

923
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,839
of these uh beliefs over external states

924
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,320
the

925
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,560
the actual physical states of the system

926
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,399
encode these parameters which

927
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,918
so yeah you embody a best guess

928
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,960
the the generative model is the point of

929
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,599
reference for the free energy gradients

930
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,239
so you can think of one as like you know

931
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,280
uh

932
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
the inference model and the other is the

933
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,560
control

934
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,040
model in the sense that the inference

935
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,079
model or the recognition

936
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
density is sort of like my best guess

937
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,480
right now and the generative model

938
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
is is essentially you know a model of

939
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,079
what my phenotypic

940
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,280
preferences are and uh it's the tandem

941
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
between the two that kind of gets you

942
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
behavior

943
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,880
as in um the generative model provides

944
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,839
the point

945
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,880
uh the point of reference uh for the

946
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,560
definition of the variational free

947
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
energy gradients i.e

948
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,119
how close am i um to

949
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,320
my you know desired sensory distribution

950
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,920
and the recognition model tells you

951
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,160
where you are effectively

952
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
so it's like where where i am where i

953
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,160
want to be and the free energy is sort

954
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,440
of the difference between the two

955
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,839
effectively

956
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,560
um so i mean the first part of that

957
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
question yes you're right in

958
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,920
understanding the generative model as a

959
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,359
control system

960
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,640
um the recognition density is just the

961
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,480
best guess it's the posterior

962
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
uh so i mean it yes it is harnessing

963
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
these relations that are being described

964
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,920
here

965
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,839
uh but that's precisely because it's a

966
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,440
posterior estimate

967
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
of uh you know states and precisions and

968
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
all that

969
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,640
cool and one more thought on that is

970
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,119
for an agent who knows about for example

971
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
how hammers and nails are related

972
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,599
through their internal models they might

973
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,359
look at hammers and nails and pieces of

974
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:07,920
wood

975
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,839
and think you know later on i could

976
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,960
build a house with this

977
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,520
and so it's actually a future affordance

978
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
but it's based upon sensory input at the

979
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,720
current moment

980
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,760
um cool i'm gonna just

981
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
move on to the next slide and just a

982
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,160
short little quote by

983
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,320
buckminster fuller because sometimes i

984
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,280
just have to

985
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,160
he wrote rope may not be much like water

986
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,560
but

987
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,720
not is like the wave and this is from

988
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
the synergetics framework

989
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,640
and it's getting at this notion that

990
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
there's a difference between structural

991
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,040
integrity

992
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
which is like the rope and the water

993
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
which are quite different they're both

994
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,760
static and stable

995
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,640
to pattern integrity and knots and waves

996
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,440
can travel

997
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
through a medium and so by virtue of

998
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,720
traveling through medium

999
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,119
kind of like that domino wave there's

1000
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,000
something similar

1001
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
about these traveling waves that goes

1002
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,040
beyond the mere structural integrity of

1003
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,079
their media and so i just a thought

1004
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,520
question for later is really

1005
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,359
is active inference a structural

1006
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
integrity or a pattern integrity

1007
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
i would say that it's a pattern

1008
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
integrity and just bringing up this

1009
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
notion that many far from equilibrium

1010
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,040
systems

1011
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
though their mechanisms are extremely

1012
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
different for example the bacteria

1013
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,800
and the person there's going to be

1014
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,720
similarities because of the way that

1015
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
they're needing to persist

1016
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,280
from a cybernetic perspective enough

1017
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,920
there

1018
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
let's get to that question about

1019
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,560
structural aspects of attractors

1020
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,760
so here a participant provided feedback

1021
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,560
and wrote

1022
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
why can't the recognition and generative

1023
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,240
models be considered as structural

1024
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,920
representations so they're coming from a

1025
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
structural representationalist

1026
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,400
perspective

1027
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
they wrote in which case the dynamics of

1028
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,320
the structure are taken into account as

1029
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,839
part of the representation

1030
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,359
even if we're appealing to dynamical

1031
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,359
systems the states of any particular

1032
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,480
dynamical system

1033
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
over time make up the structural

1034
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
representation

1035
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,839
take the lorenz attractor the lorenz

1036
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,599
attractor has a specific approximate

1037
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,680
structure around two attractor states

1038
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
but the states and the trajectory of any

1039
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,960
point are sensitive to initial

1040
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,000
conditions

1041
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,400
so any two initial points will lead to

1042
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
different precise physical states and

1043
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,040
dynamics

1044
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,800
but will still travel through a very

1045
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
similar trajectory which hovers around

1046
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
these attractor basins

1047
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,920
the states and the dynamics of a set of

1048
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,119
points over time

1049
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,720
can be taken as a whole and be

1050
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
identified as embodying structural

1051
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
representations of the lorenz system

1052
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,839
so this is something from the realm of

1053
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,480
chaos

1054
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
and complexity theory and the lorenz

1055
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
attractor is an attractor

1056
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that describes a simplified system of

1057
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
equations describing the flow of fluid

1058
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
and it's a fluid of uniform depth and

1059
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,480
there are also parameters for the

1060
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,079
imposed temperature difference

1061
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,400
the gravity parameters the buoyancy the

1062
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,240
thermal diffusivity and the kinematic

1063
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
viscosity

1064
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,560
and the simple physical analogy here is

1065
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
like heating up a pot of water there's

1066
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,839
heat coming from the bottom

1067
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,839
and there's cooling coming from the top

1068
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,520
and there's this churning happening and

1069
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,359
it goes around these two different

1070
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,960
attractor states

1071
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,000
so in this case maybe alex

1072
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
uh or anyone else who raises their hand

1073
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,839
what is structure

1074
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,839
and what is representation and if we

1075
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,839
agree on what this system is then what

1076
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,079
is this representation debate that's

1077
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,480
happening

1078
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,680
mel

1079
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,359
mel unmuted mel

1080
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,240
or maxwell go ahead all right okay let's

1081
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,480
go to alex

1082
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
yeah mel if you want to speak english

1083
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,240
it's raised then we'll go to alex keefe

1084
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,118
and they'll raise their hand

1085
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
okay well i was gonna say hey let me

1086
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
talk um i don't have much to say about

1087
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
the lorenz attractor um it looks like

1088
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
a i mean what's i'm not sure what's

1089
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
supposed to be represented in this case

1090
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,480
like it i have an intuition in the case

1091
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
of dealing with like

1092
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,000
a biological system because you know

1093
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,480
we're

1094
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,839
intuitively representing some kind of

1095
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,680
environment i'm just not sure

1096
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,319
i'm not sure how to begin with this

1097
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,920
example

1098
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,599
um right we've got the state space

1099
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,680
and this nice graphical representation

1100
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,440
of the states of this of the state space

1101
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,119
but

1102
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,640
unless we interpret this entire system

1103
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,000
as representing something i don't know

1104
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
what to say about

1105
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,160
its sort of content

1106
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,279
okay cool mel

1107
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,359
i don't know what a recommendation

1108
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,800
is and so i

1109
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,839
for that reason i guess i think that the

1110
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720
question of

1111
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,720
what a representation is and

1112
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,480
what in the world is a representation is

1113
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,680
is maybe too ambitious only because i

1114
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,720
haven't solved it

1115
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,680
um but there's a related question that's

1116
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,119
less ambitious which is

1117
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,520
what is the difference between a

1118
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,480
biological

1119
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,160
function and a representation

1120
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,920
um and that i think is more manageable

1121
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,720
in some respects

1122
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,640
in phil bio mind cogsi

1123
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
we um speak of the disjunction problem

1124
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
so we speak of and i know maxwell like

1125
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,920
hates this framing and thinks it's

1126
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,359
updated and we don't need it anymore

1127
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,280
the idea is that in order for

1128
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,359
representation to be a representation it

1129
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,920
needs to have the capacity to represent

1130
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
and we have a similar idea in biological

1131
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
function which is

1132
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,200
that in order for a function to be a

1133
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,119
function it needs to have

1134
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,160
the capacity to malfunction right so you

1135
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,920
need malfunction dab function you need

1136
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,160
misrepresentation that representation

1137
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,319
um but how do we differentiate

1138
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,480
a function from representation

1139
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,680
good question maxwell then alex

1140
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,280
cool um well so regarding the question

1141
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,200
what is the representation

1142
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,319
we targeted a very specific account of

1143
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,839
representation

1144
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,319
i mean in the philosophy of cognitive

1145
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,480
science a representation is basically an

1146
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,359
internal thing within an organism that

1147
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,160
stands for

1148
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,079
some feature of the environment or the

1149
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,440
organism's own body

1150
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,599
in a way that the organism can leverage

1151
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,560
to you know do something interesting

1152
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,720
we focus more specifically on the claim

1153
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,079
that

1154
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,040
generative models are structural

1155
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,520
representations

1156
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,560
so uh i mean this has

1157
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,119
been an account that's been uh you know

1158
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,040
opium o'brien first worked on this in

1159
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,560
the mid 2000s

1160
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,280
uh and then gladsyevsky and milkowski in

1161
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
the context of predictive coding

1162
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,800
and then alex kieffer and jakob howie

1163
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
uh you know built on that i think in a

1164
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,280
very interesting way

1165
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
and you know from that point of view

1166
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,240
structural representation

1167
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,319
is an internal structure that's internal

1168
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,920
to an organism that gets its

1169
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
representational content

1170
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,160
uh because it stands in a relation of

1171
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,400
structural similarity to some target

1172
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,040
domain

1173
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
in the sense that uh second order

1174
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
structural features of that

1175
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
target domain like the statistical

1176
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,920
properties of

1177
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,480
the domain are recapitulated or like

1178
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
mirrored in

1179
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,560
uh the the actual properties of the the

1180
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,079
representations themselves

1181
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,160
that's the first uh there's a structural

1182
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,760
similarity first property

1183
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,400
second property it's not just that these

1184
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,960
uh

1185
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
structures are in the organism they have

1186
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,440
to be exploitable in some sense

1187
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,760
so the organism needs to be able to use

1188
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,640
uh the

1189
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,839
content uh encoded in uh

1190
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,319
the representation to guide intelligent

1191
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,720
adaptive behavior

1192
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,960
um and then there are these two other uh

1193
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,560
points that i think are pretty minor it

1194
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,319
has to be detachable

1195
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,680
meaning that the system can use it

1196
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,599
offline uh

1197
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,760
like as in uh you know not not like

1198
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,520
actually engaging with the environment

1199
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
and it has to be able to

1200
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,079
afford representational error detection

1201
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
uh in a matter similar to maps

1202
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,599
um so those are the main features of

1203
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,440
structural representations according to

1204
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,880
the

1205
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,720
the philosophical account on offer and

1206
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,240
uh in this paper we propose that

1207
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,599
generative models are not structural

1208
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,079
representations

1209
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,160
uh precisely because they don't really

1210
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,440
need these

1211
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
the these properties don't seem to be

1212
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
true of

1213
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,280
uh the generative models um

1214
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
i mean yeah it i i think alex and i are

1215
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,560
gonna

1216
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
still disagree about this even after

1217
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
talking about it for like dozens of

1218
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
hours at this point but

1219
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,440
um yeah uh the main

1220
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,480
the main reason why uh in this paper we

1221
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,680
argue that they're not

1222
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,200
is that the generative model isn't

1223
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,359
encoded in anything

1224
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,000
uh and this is like one of the main

1225
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,520
differences between more traditional

1226
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,400
bayesian

1227
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,800
brain architectures and active inference

1228
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,440
as dan was pointing out really early on

1229
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
uh in traditional architectures well the

1230
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,200
recognition and generative

1231
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,520
models are just inverse the ones of the

1232
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,359
others the the recognition model is a

1233
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,440
mapping from the data to states

1234
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,720
and uh the generative uh model is a

1235
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,800
mapping from states to data

1236
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,280
so it's really just the same kind of set

1237
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,880
of connections and everything but it's

1238
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,480
just like which direction are you

1239
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,359
considering it

1240
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,560
like from the top down flow or

1241
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,520
from the from the uh the top down floor

1242
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,599
the bottom up flow of information

1243
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,280
um in the active inference scheme

1244
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
it doesn't work like that uh the

1245
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,880
generative model is nowhere

1246
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,119
in the dynamics sorry is nowhere in the

1247
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,720
physical organism

1248
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,760
it's only in the dynamics so uh it's

1249
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
very much like these dominoes falling

1250
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:06,800
over

1251
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,960
uh the wave of falling dominoes

1252
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,240
isn't present in any of the kind of

1253
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,920
single dominoes falling over uh the wave

1254
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,560
is

1255
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,200
is is part of the dynamic you know

1256
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,800
phenomenon

1257
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,280
uh and it's it's the same with the the

1258
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,640
variational free energy and the

1259
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
generative model the

1260
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,760
generative model just is not there any

1261
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,400
at any

1262
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,880
at any time slice uh it only exists

1263
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,599
in so far as we consider a lapse of time

1264
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,599
as the point of reference for the

1265
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,480
free energy gradients um so from that

1266
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,200
point of view it can't possibly be

1267
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,960
a structural representation because it's

1268
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,400
not encoded by

1269
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
anything cool well that's that's the

1270
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,000
point a lot there

1271
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,280
let's go to alejandra melvin

1272
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,560
okay we'll go to alex alejandra

1273
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
i figured i figured you'd have something

1274
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,160
there yeah well

1275
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,000
i mean that was a really a nice

1276
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
explanation of what structural

1277
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,680
representationalism is so uh

1278
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,680
i don't have much to argue about there

1279
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,040
um

1280
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,720
and in general i don't i don't want to

1281
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
argue more than is necessary

1282
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,839
you know that about me but um i think um

1283
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,359
the reason i want to insist on some of

1284
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,359
this stuff is just to for my own basic

1285
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,880
sanity to just feel like i have an

1286
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,559
understanding of what's going on with

1287
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,839
this stuff right

1288
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,440
um so the reasons despite i understand

1289
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,359
i think i understand exactly why from an

1290
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,520
active inference perspective

1291
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,000
um you wouldn't want to say that the

1292
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,599
generative model is a

1293
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,920
is encoded let me just say at first i

1294
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,359
think

1295
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,720
the question of whether or how it's

1296
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,640
encoded is maybe a slightly distinct

1297
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,520
question from whether it's a

1298
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
representation and the reason i think

1299
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
that it has to be a representation

1300
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,119
well there are many reasons here one

1301
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,599
argument the recognition model is an

1302
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,200
approximation to the generative model

1303
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,599
right

1304
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,119
and so that's one example of like a

1305
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,599
rational or probabilistic relationship

1306
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,119
between these models and i don't think

1307
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:03,520
that

1308
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,040
that makes any sense if the generative

1309
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,520
model is not a representation also

1310
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,640
um so that's how that works on directive

1311
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,440
inference

1312
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
i i agree that in in a more traditional

1313
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,359
bayesian brain sense the recognition

1314
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,720
model is trying to

1315
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,680
approximate uh the generative model i

1316
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,000
mean that's

1317
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,880
that's essentially how it's working um

1318
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,400
it's an approximate posterior

1319
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,200
approximation yeah

1320
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
it's an approximate posterior but it

1321
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,559
isn't approximating

1322
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,480
the generative model well it's

1323
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,079
approximating the posterior under the

1324
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,520
genitive model right

1325
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,200
so so right and both

1326
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,640
both the generative and the recognition

1327
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
models are concerned their

1328
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,319
distributions in part over uh

1329
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,480
i have to be careful here not the actual

1330
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,000
external states necessarily

1331
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,480
but over hidden hidden states i don't

1332
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,119
know

1333
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,800
how on earth you get those into the

1334
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,319
picture if it's not a representation

1335
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,760
that you're talking about because the

1336
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,839
states are environmental states they're

1337
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,880
not necess

1338
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,640
right we have to be as you point out in

1339
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,920
the paper we have to be careful to

1340
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,200
distinguish the generative model from

1341
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,800
the generative process

1342
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,480
we can't just identify what actually

1343
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,200
happens with the generative model

1344
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,920
we i think we need to have this is one

1345
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,040
of the fundamental questions that i

1346
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,760
think an activism often is faced with is

1347
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,680
how do we deal with yeah i mean mel

1348
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
brought up misrepresentation

1349
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,839
um so the fact that the fact the point

1350
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,400
is

1351
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,160
the the way that you see the world the

1352
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,079
organism or creature system sees the

1353
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,079
world is not necessarily the way it is

1354
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,760
but we still have that distribution over

1355
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,680
external states as

1356
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,599
essentially part of the generative model

1357
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,960
let me just say one more thing here

1358
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,440
about

1359
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,920
encoding so the reason i think if you

1360
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,240
look under the hood a little bit so

1361
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,160
the generative model in under active

1362
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
inference as i understand it

1363
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,680
can roughly be identified with the

1364
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,520
non-equilibrium steady state density

1365
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,559
right something like that um

1366
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,040
so i i mean i would just say right the

1367
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,319
dynamics

1368
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,920
the dynamics sort of instantiate the

1369
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,440
generative model i think that's a really

1370
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,920
cool point and i actually think that

1371
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,280
structural representationalists didn't

1372
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,880
do quite enough to

1373
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,400
emphasize the fact that the generative

1374
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,880
model is used as a control system

1375
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,720
but i think if you look under the hood

1376
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,000
there will be some features of the

1377
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,599
system like stable

1378
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,839
structural features in virtue of which

1379
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,960
it has that nest density

1380
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,359
so in fact you will find some stable

1381
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,400
thing that you could think of as

1382
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,920
encoding

1383
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,640
the generative model maybe at least

1384
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,040
that's

1385
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,000
why i still have you know i'm still

1386
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,520
attached to my views on this

1387
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,160
cool let's do alejandra and then mel

1388
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,160
yeah um i think i i um

1389
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,599
i agree with alex or where are

1390
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,800
i'm kind of confused how

1391
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,040
the generative model can be conceived um

1392
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,400
just like this an active process

1393
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,440
um really i was like

1394
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,640
reading the paper all over again and

1395
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,640
um i actually don't get it um for me it

1396
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,760
was

1397
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,200
um the recognition density is the

1398
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,040
inversion of the generative model

1399
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,880
so uh if it is not encoded

1400
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,240
like anywhere it's i

1401
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,680
i feel kind of uh lost there

1402
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,760
um for me yeah these top-down

1403
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,880
connections

1404
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,599
this is the generative model talking

1405
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,359
about the brain specifically

1406
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,040
and the recognition density is

1407
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,200
related with this button up connection

1408
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,720
so you can recognize

1409
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,480
um your best guess right so

1410
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,480
if it is not encoded um

1411
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,040
what can be said about these top-down

1412
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,400
connections

1413
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,800
um i don't know

1414
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,119
maybe i can jump in here and just

1415
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,680
provide some points of clarification

1416
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,920
sure about the generation wall if that's

1417
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,640
okay yep um

1418
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
okay so uh is screen sharing activated

1419
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,520
um you could share your screen

1420
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,760
if you yeah you probably should be able

1421
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,839
to

1422
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,920
okay let me try this

1423
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,200
okay so this is from a paper called uh

1424
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,839
the graphical brain

1425
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,200
and this is what the generative models

1426
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,359
look like all right can everyone see my

1427
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:33,839
screen

1428
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,280
yep also we're going to be returning

1429
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,079
look at this in the center

1430
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
yeah so the generative model is defined

1431
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,160
as a joint probability density over all

1432
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,920
of the variables of interest in the

1433
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,559
system

1434
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,599
right so uh in this case uh the

1435
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,200
variables of interest are the states

1436
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,079
that we're trying to

1437
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,440
infer which are here s the policies that

1438
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,960
i'm trying to pursue

1439
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,000
which is here pi and the data that i'm

1440
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,680
observing at any given time

1441
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,440
step uh which is here denoted o um

1442
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,400
just so everyone uh is clear time flows

1443
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,319
from left to right so this is the first

1444
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,160
state this is the second state this is

1445
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,440
the third state

1446
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,960
and essentially the model you only have

1447
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,640
access to this data point these are

1448
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
counter factual data points

1449
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,640
uh and the whole thing is updated

1450
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,000
basically at every time

1451
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,119
step um and so look it the the

1452
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,800
generative model itself like i said is

1453
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,040
just a joint probability density

1454
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,960
it's like the probability of all these

1455
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,480
variables connected with

1456
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,599
ands effectively and when we say that

1457
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,280
the generative model is not

1458
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,680
present in the system i mean that this

1459
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,640
density here

1460
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
this joint probability density is never

1461
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,960
encoded anywhere in the system

1462
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,160
uh because the generative model itself

1463
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,359
is factorized so

1464
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,440
basically you you take this joint

1465
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,839
probability density and then using some

1466
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,960
uh you know bayes rule and and other uh

1467
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,680
you know

1468
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,839
chain rule etc uh manipulations

1469
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,880
you can write this joint density as

1470
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,160
the product of a bunch of uh likelihoods

1471
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,599
and priors

1472
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,559
and it's these likelihoods and priors

1473
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,119
that

1474
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,720
are uh updated constantly as part of the

1475
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,520
recognition

1476
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,440
density so this this prior

1477
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,079
uh you know about your your data given

1478
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,920
your states and this other prior about

1479
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,680
your states given the next date and the

1480
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,040
policy and all this

1481
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,400
these are updated uh dynamically

1482
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,760
and their current value uh like all of

1483
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,720
them together

1484
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,520
can collectively comprise the generative

1485
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,480
model

1486
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,400
uh yeah that's right sorry the

1487
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,599
recognition model

1488
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,720
the uh generative model is how these

1489
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,640
quantities are all connected the ones to

1490
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,319
the others so like if you want to think

1491
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,000
about it heuristically

1492
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,040
uh you know this uh all of these

1493
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,440
specific parameters like the s the pi

1494
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,079
the o

1495
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,880
all that like there all of those values

1496
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,520
together

1497
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,040
as they're being updated uh comprise the

1498
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,920
recognition

1499
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,440
uh density and the generative density or

1500
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,200
the generative model is really just

1501
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,240
these relations between uh

1502
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,799
the different quantities as they change

1503
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:23,359
so

1504
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,040
it's it's literally that the um

1505
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,240
the inference process

1506
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,599
itself is what holds all these

1507
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,799
quantities together

1508
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,400
and the generative model is just a

1509
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,920
description of how those

1510
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,440
quantities flow together uh

1511
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,160
yeah and so again it's like the domino's

1512
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,280
uh falling over

1513
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,000
thing uh you know the the the wave of

1514
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,480
dominoes only exists in that motion

1515
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,280
and and similarly the generative model

1516
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,480
only exists

1517
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,040
in that kind of coordinated inference or

1518
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,520
update

1519
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,760
dynamics of the quantities that are part

1520
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,880
of the recognition

1521
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,160
density um yeah

1522
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,119
and the reason it's called the

1523
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,720
generative model at all is just because

1524
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,440
it's borrowed

1525
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,200
it's a terminology borrowed from machine

1526
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,480
learning uh

1527
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,599
in machine learning the the joint

1528
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,359
probability density over all of your

1529
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,200
variables is known as a generative model

1530
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,640
so it's it's called that way

1531
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,200
just because that's the that's the

1532
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,000
technical

1533
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,240
term uh it's it's also called that way

1534
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,680
because if you're starting from a joint

1535
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,440
density over all of your variables you

1536
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,280
can actually generate

1537
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,760
fictive data that you would expect under

1538
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,200
this configuration

1539
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,400
um of different uh parameters

1540
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,720
oh thanks for that clarification maxwell

1541
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,160
will have those middles

1542
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,319
we'll have mel and then we'll carry on

1543
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
with that all sounds pretty good to me

1544
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,200
go for it mel

1545
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,200
i think kate and mill have yeah yeah

1546
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,119
okay kate and then mel oh i just wanted

1547
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,960
to um

1548
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,799
follow up to what maxell was saying

1549
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,200
about structural representation

1550
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,480
can you hear me yep go for it

1551
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,359
can people hear me yes yes yes we can

1552
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,160
hear it beautiful

1553
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,000
awesome yeah just to follow up to what

1554
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,359
maxwell was saying about

1555
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:17,839
um structural representations uh

1556
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,799
the the sort of detachability of the

1557
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,160
representation right that's

1558
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
that's what should get us the

1559
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,480
distinction between

1560
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,440
a biological function and at least a

1561
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,240
structural representation right because

1562
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,680
my feet and legs and

1563
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,440
knees are a representation of

1564
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,040
ground in some very minimal sense in the

1565
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,480
same way that

1566
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,520
fish fins are representations of

1567
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,880
of fish sins and and bird wings or

1568
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,960
representations of fluid dynamics right

1569
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,319
um but this isn't

1570
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,720
detachable from immediate environmental

1571
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,640
circumstance for offline use

1572
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,880
right um so that's what should get us

1573
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,799
the difference between uh

1574
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,119
function representation but i'm i'm

1575
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,000
curious to

1576
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,040
see what role that plays in

1577
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,720
in the ftp in active interest um if any

1578
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,040
do we want to do we want to is there is

1579
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,559
there merit and retaining a distinction

1580
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,200
between

1581
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,440
function eruption patients under under

1582
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,960
active infants in the sap or are they

1583
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,520
just

1584
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,880
sort of continuous with one another nice

1585
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
very good question kate did you have

1586
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,520
something there

1587
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
okay okay i'm gonna just continue with

1588
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,119
the slides because i'm not sure if i

1589
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,400
think kate's up next

1590
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,000
yeah oh sorry i wasn't first just wanted

1591
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
to apply um i think i'm still

1592
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,880
with the in the case of the the paper

1593
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,319
was really useful for me in like

1594
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,200
helping me understand what the

1595
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,599
generation model was in the fep almost

1596
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,160
all the way

1597
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,760
like when it's described as like a

1598
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,040
statistical description of the

1599
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,160
generative process the way you've

1600
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,880
explained it

1601
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,079
all of that makes sense to me um

1602
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,200
but then there's also parts in the paper

1603
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,000
where it says

1604
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,680
where you think it's like the generative

1605
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,119
model sort of

1606
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,280
um is what the organism expects and it

1607
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,799
guides what the organism does

1608
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,400
which makes it sound like the generative

1609
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,319
model is playing this kind of

1610
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,799
causal role not just for the generative

1611
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,160
model itself

1612
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,319
um and i find that kind of confusing if

1613
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,760
the given the generative model isn't

1614
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,599
something encoded by the organism

1615
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,960
um or by the system um

1616
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,440
that i'm still i get the idea of it as a

1617
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,720
statistical description of

1618
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,400
the dynamics that sounds right

1619
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,319
i just don't understand how in that how

1620
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,680
if that's all it is that it's something

1621
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,040
the organism uses it seems like it's

1622
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,480
something we use to describe the

1623
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,680
organism

1624
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,359
rather than something organism itself is

1625
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,520
in any way using um

1626
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,079
that's a good point i i've proposed in a

1627
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,119
recent paper

1628
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,240
uh that came out in entropy not too long

1629
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,119
ago that

1630
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,640
uh both are correct so the you basically

1631
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,040
the the correct way to interpret the fep

1632
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,760
is as

1633
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,920
instrumentalism next nested within

1634
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,440
instrumentalism

1635
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,520
meaning that we can have a model

1636
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,559
theoretic

1637
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,799
uh philosophy of science reading of the

1638
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,839
fep

1639
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,760
and you know for that matter any other

1640
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,960
theory of cognition

1641
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,440
as this is a model that we as scientists

1642
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,359
are using to explain

1643
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,279
the behavior of organisms

1644
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,799
what i've been trying to argue is that

1645
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,200
the fep itself at the theory level

1646
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,839
is also saying the organism is

1647
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:30,720
exploiting

1648
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,640
the statistical structure of its body

1649
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,359
and movement aka the generative model

1650
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,640
to guide adaptive behavior so the model

1651
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,680
really is these harnessed

1652
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,920
relations between the variables that

1653
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,720
have to

1654
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,240
obtain for survival to persist

1655
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,200
uh and you know so it's it's sort of

1656
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,040
this idea that once the system kind of

1657
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,200
gets moving then there's kind of a

1658
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,400
an inertial dynamic thing

1659
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
kind of keeping it moving so like you

1660
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,599
know my

1661
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,680
core body temperature is 36 and a half

1662
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,640
degrees

1663
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,359
and the fact that it is keeps a bunch of

1664
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,119
other processes in play

1665
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,000
that in turn keep me preserving my

1666
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,040
temperature

1667
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,440
uh you know by initiating adaptive

1668
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,040
behavior like putting on a parko and it

1669
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,760
gets cold and so on

1670
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,119
so uh yeah i mean both

1671
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,359
both kinds of generative models are used

1672
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,280
separately in dynamical causal

1673
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,160
modeling uh of the kind that the fristen

1674
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:30,640
group

1675
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,520
used to model the spread of covid we're

1676
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,880
not assuming

1677
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,559
that the process that we're modeling is

1678
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,960
itself an active inference agent

1679
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,400
um and it so you can do that

1680
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,319
but you can also make the additional

1681
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,520
assumption that it is

1682
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,359
and then you're in the game of active

1683
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,920
inference proper

1684
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,480
cool thanks max i'll go ahead kate

1685
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,960
can i come back to that go ahead go

1686
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,240
ahead yes absolutely

1687
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,480
i i the thing the kind of worry i get

1688
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,640
there then it sort of seems

1689
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,000
like you're losing the distinction

1690
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,359
between the vehicle of the model and the

1691
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,839
target of the model such that

1692
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,440
i worry it sounds a bit like just saying

1693
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,119
everything is a model of itself

1694
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,280
essentially um i mean effectively that

1695
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,760
is what we're saying

1696
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,440
and that's where it gets a little hazy

1697
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,200
for me like you know that's probably the

1698
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
point of disagreement between alex and i

1699
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
also i want to say the generative model

1700
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
just is the organism

1701
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,400
in the sense that like this this

1702
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,599
specific you know statistical structure

1703
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,760
that harnesses all of these different

1704
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
you know existential variables as

1705
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,400
mel was saying like this really just is

1706
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,839
the organism

1707
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,680
like this kind of statistical structure

1708
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,880
that keeps kind of

1709
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,319
reiterating itself and coming

1710
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,720
into existence that just is the organism

1711
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,920
and that's one of the reasons

1712
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,680
why i don't want to say that this model

1713
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,079
is a representation of anything

1714
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,480
you could just call it you know the

1715
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,359
phenotype

1716
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,079
we call it a generative model because

1717
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,359
formally speaking

1718
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,440
the same construct is borrowed from a

1719
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,119
field where in which it's called a

1720
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,480
generative model but

1721
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,079
you can think of it as the organism's

1722
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,720
phenotype and precisely because it's a

1723
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,119
bit weird to think of

1724
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,280
the model as modeling itself i kind of

1725
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,359
resist that interpretation

1726
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,039
and say well you know if anything is a

1727
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,720
model really in the more traditional

1728
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,480
sense it's this recognition density

1729
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,000
that's performing posterior state

1730
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,880
inference

1731
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,520
and i'm sure that alex will tell me why

1732
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,480
i'm wrong

1733
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,680
in a second it's it's a great

1734
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,920
response let's just move on through a

1735
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,520
few more of the slides because there's a

1736
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:39,920
lot

1737
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,640
in the figures that i think gets at this

1738
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,240
um but mel has their hand though

1739
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,520
sorry go ahead mel

1740
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,280
oh i just want to i just wanted to

1741
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,359
introduce it i think i think

1742
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,760
maxwell is possibly mismodeling himself

1743
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,559
i think he's

1744
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,640
i think he's actually a tad bit more

1745
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,760
realist

1746
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,880
than he's letting on oh maxwell

1747
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,000
a realist at heart on my bad days

1748
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,240
exactly if you can't if you can't uh

1749
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,400
take care of me at my most real

1750
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,799
so in this next slide one of the

1751
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,039
feedback just from a participant just to

1752
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:13,520
give a

1753
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,319
example and we won't spend too much time

1754
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:16,720
here

1755
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,680
but i like this idea that the beliefs

1756
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,680
don't have to be verbal

1757
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,720
uh that the physical therapy context

1758
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,880
shows us how the range of movements that

1759
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,839
the body does not

1760
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,000
want to go to for example due to a

1761
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
traumatic experience or injury

1762
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,079
embodies a belief that doesn't involve

1763
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,319
language and this was a paper with

1764
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:39,520
uh limanowski and fristen from 2020

1765
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,440
where a person's hand was opening and

1766
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,720
closing and then they were getting a vr

1767
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,960
visual that was delayed or was

1768
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,920
inaccurate

1769
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,079
and so there's so much here about how

1770
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,400
our sensory feedback are proprioceptive

1771
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,000
as well as our visual feedback

1772
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,680
multimodal systems

1773
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,039
are being used and that's the mess that

1774
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,880
would take us you know so many hours

1775
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
and more to clarify this is what the

1776
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
representation questions are about

1777
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,480
so it's like the person what is the

1778
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,000
representation of the current state

1779
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,559
of their hand being closed at that just

1780
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:11,039
pure

1781
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,119
phenotype level maybe somebody with a

1782
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,720
ruler says well it's whether the hand is

1783
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,680
closed or not

1784
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,839
but it's not just that because if you're

1785
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,599
getting visual input that's messing with

1786
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,160
you

1787
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,000
it changes your behavior so there's

1788
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,680
something else happening and that's

1789
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,079
really

1790
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,119
a lot of what we're talking about um

1791
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,839
i think going through the figures two

1792
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:30,960
three four

1793
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,880
are going to be really helpful before we

1794
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,240
have closing

1795
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,319
thoughts and thanks everyone for bearing

1796
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:37,599
with this was sort of a

1797
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,559
weirdly technically altered stream

1798
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:41,440
briefly

1799
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,480
the bayesian networks so bayesian

1800
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,599
networks are

1801
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,720
from bayesian statistical sciences

1802
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,760
and in these diagrams the nodes are

1803
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,680
variables they're like random variables

1804
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,839
stochastic variables or parameters

1805
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,640
the edges are statistical relationships

1806
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,319
they're probabilistic relationships and

1807
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,680
they can be undirected

1808
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,160
or directed these models are quite

1809
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,680
common in statistics

1810
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,920
and also there's some really nice

1811
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,960
aspects about them

1812
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
in that you can bring prior knowledge to

1813
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,720
the table with your priors and you can

1814
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,559
also estimate it directly from the data

1815
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,039
with a parametric empirical base

1816
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,720
and to give an example about what this

1817
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,559
looks like here on the top right

1818
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,319
we can see how like an accident

1819
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:23,520
increases the likelihood that you'll

1820
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,559
hear sirens

1821
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,079
an accident also increases the

1822
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,640
likelihood of having a traffic jam

1823
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,839
bad weather it can increase the

1824
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,240
likelihood of accidents or traffic jams

1825
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,160
so these bayesian networks are pretty

1826
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,079
commonly used in a lot of statistical

1827
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:36,960
areas

1828
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,799
and we can contrast that with what are

1829
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,799
called forney factor graphs

1830
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,640
and working through this devries and

1831
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,480
first and paper was definitely

1832
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
quite an experience this is a complex

1833
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,160
paper and there's a lot in it

1834
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,280
but in a forney factor graph as they

1835
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,359
write in the paper it's a type of

1836
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,200
graphical model that shares qualities

1837
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
with bayesian networks and markov random

1838
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:57,920
fields

1839
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,160
forney factor graphs afford a visually

1840
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
insightful representation of generative

1841
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,720
models

1842
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,799
especially beneficial for complex models

1843
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,599
underlying hierarchical active inference

1844
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,240
in a forney factor graph each factor is

1845
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,920
represented by a node

1846
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,000
and each variable by an edge so it's

1847
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,839
like a flip of the bayesian

1848
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,000
an edge attaches to a node if the edge

1849
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,480
variable is an argument of the node

1850
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,039
and so here on the right is a table from

1851
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,359
the paper of devry's and fristen

1852
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,039
and it shows how we can think about

1853
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,559
these functions like addition

1854
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,119
subtraction multiplication as having

1855
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,319
variables coming in

1856
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,720
and out and just to really quickly

1857
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,000
summarize the similarities and

1858
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,640
differences

1859
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,480
in the bayesian networks the nodes are

1860
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,559
variables whereas in the forney graph

1861
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,000
the nodes are the factors or the

1862
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,280
functions

1863
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,880
in the bayesian networks the edges are

1864
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,720
the probabilistic relationships amongst

1865
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,520
variables

1866
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,599
whereas in the forney factor graphs the

1867
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,160
edges are the variables themself

1868
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,160
a cool trick about bayesian networks is

1869
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,599
this model inversion

1870
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,480
which is that the model can be gleaned

1871
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,280
from the data

1872
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,359
and also the data can be generated from

1873
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,119
a model another cool trick of

1874
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,359
fornigraphs is that they specify

1875
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,839
a specific order for factorizable

1876
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:08,960
computation

1877
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,039
making extremely massive models

1878
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,520
tractable and then a last cool fact

1879
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,200
about a bayesian network is that's where

1880
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,839
the markov blanket formalism comes from

1881
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,279
which is it's the set of nodes that

1882
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,040
insulates one part of the network from

1883
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,839
each other

1884
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,000
from a probabilistic perspective though

1885
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,520
there's a there's a lot of nuance in how

1886
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,359
it's used in the free energy principle

1887
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,359
framework and the cool fact about the

1888
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,880
forney graphs is that it's

1889
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,960
linked to information theory and message

1890
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,839
passing computation and other math

1891
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:39,198
so in figure two we um see

1892
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,520
this generative model in active

1893
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,880
inference and this is actually the model

1894
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,759
that maxwell had on his screen earlier

1895
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,040
and i annotated all the pieces so just

1896
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,120
as maxwell was saying time flows from

1897
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,960
the left to the right

1898
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,439
and in this is a again a bayesian

1899
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,279
network representation

1900
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,238
so the the boxes or the circles and

1901
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,520
there's different types of them which

1902
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,040
are described in the caption

1903
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,880
the boxes and the circles are like

1904
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,719
variables so the initial state is a

1905
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:07,359
vector

1906
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,960
the hidden states are variables the

1907
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,479
state transition matrix is

1908
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,319
how the hidden states map to each other

1909
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,520
that's b

1910
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,679
a is the map between the states and the

1911
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,198
observations

1912
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,359
and then figure three is the same thing

1913
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,319
as a forney factor graph and so this is

1914
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,560
showing that there's this equivalence

1915
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,000
with representing something as a

1916
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
bayesian net

1917
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,640
and a forney factor graph and the forney

1918
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,520
factor graph

1919
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,238
allows for these extremely large scale

1920
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,759
hierarchical models

1921
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,319
to get factorized and then computed in a

1922
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,198
tractable

1923
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:43,839
way and so i should say like the

1924
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,920
advantage of using a forney style factor

1925
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,759
graph is that the message passing

1926
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,600
is just you can just read it directly

1927
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,158
off the forney style factor graph

1928
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,679
and there's an algorithmic way of moving

1929
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,080
from a bayes net to a forney style

1930
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,960
factor graph

1931
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,920
so typically intuitively the bayes net

1932
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,280
is easier to write

1933
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,760
uh because you can you know you can just

1934
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,199
literally write down

1935
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,520
the dependencies between all of your

1936
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,800
factors

1937
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,199
like this uh so you know like i don't

1938
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,440
this state depends on this other state

1939
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,040
and you know there are these transitions

1940
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,640
and etc blah blah

1941
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,800
and so you know from this you can move

1942
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,320
to the forney style factor graph and

1943
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,280
that tells you

1944
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,960
just directly how that will be

1945
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,480
implemented in uh

1946
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,239
active inference i should say that the

1947
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,880
reason why i we discussed these

1948
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,920
at all is really just uh to show in the

1949
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,440
next figure how the

1950
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,440
in figure four how the generative model

1951
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
and the generative process kind of link

1952
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,560
up uh i mean to me this is where the

1953
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,600
the interesting stuff happens where like

1954
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,320
literally the the generative process and

1955
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,000
this is a model of the generative

1956
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,600
process right like how we think

1957
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,920
it's structured it's in this little box

1958
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,040
here um

1959
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,120
and then the 40 style factor graph

1960
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,400
represents the message

1961
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,760
passing that is ongoing yeah outside the

1962
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,719
box

1963
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:06,159
uh to keep all the the quantities within

1964
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,440
you know phenotypic bounds

1965
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,480
thanks maxwell and yeah i know that was

1966
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,320
a little bit of a rapid sprint through

1967
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,679
these figures

1968
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,239
but it's so cool that there's a formal

1969
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:18,719
way

1970
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,280
to relate the bayesian and the factor

1971
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:21,920
graph

1972
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,800
models and just as you specified it's

1973
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,560
easy to specify sometimes the

1974
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
bayesian network just like oh well the

1975
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,239
traffic jam depends on the weather and

1976
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:31,520
the weather depends on this other

1977
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,320
feature

1978
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,040
and then the factor graph allows us to

1979
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,600
have an

1980
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,480
order of computation and a really uh

1981
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,080
implementable way to compute it

1982
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,000
and also it has some similarities with

1983
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
message passing for example in neural

1984
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,480
network

1985
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,520
systems so it's it's an interesting

1986
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,040
question that i've been having is

1987
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,120
okay we talk about this is as a bayesian

1988
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,000
theory but if it can also be represented

1989
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,239
in another way is it is it really a

1990
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,640
uniquely bayesian theory or what do we

1991
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,880
gain by saying that it's a bayesian

1992
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,280
theory it's uh within the domain of

1993
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,120
bayesian inter-transformability uh or

1994
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,600
interoperability

1995
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,159
but that doesn't uniquely uh

1996
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,360
disambiguate it

1997
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,560
and that's why i think some of these

1998
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,000
philosophical questions that we're

1999
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,360
talking about here like about

2000
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,400
representation

2001
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,000
and about cause are so open because

2002
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,600
uh it's it's not uniquely specified by

2003
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,120
the free energy principle or by active

2004
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,960
inference like how exactly we should

2005
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,679
answer these

2006
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,520
philosophical questions because in the

2007
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,880
end as maxwell said

2008
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,640
it's the technical details this is what

2009
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,000
we're talking about

2010
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,600
when we're talking about the the free

2011
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,440
energy minimization and how that bears

2012
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,199
upon the policy selection

2013
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,880
this is what's happening and also one

2014
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,480
more point before if anyone

2015
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,040
raises their hand to provide a comment

2016
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:45,920
is um

2017
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,640
notice that the free energy is linking

2018
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,159
to the policy selection

2019
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,520
pi p for policy and that means that

2020
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,320
the organism isn't just minimizing the

2021
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,480
free energy of the observations given

2022
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,880
a sort of neutral representation

2023
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,440
actually the policy representation

2024
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,840
specifically how it bears upon how

2025
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,400
states transition into each other

2026
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,520
that's what the actual computation is

2027
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,080
being done

2028
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,679
upon so the observations are being used

2029
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:16,480
to run then

2030
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,600
upstream through the hidden states

2031
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,560
and their transitions into the policy

2032
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,400
that ultimately dictates what's going to

2033
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,120
be done

2034
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,120
by being selected by the organism or the

2035
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,480
system as the most

2036
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,040
likely so this is really how deeply

2037
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,280
action is embedded in these models

2038
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,800
it's not that there's a latent

2039
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,360
representation of the external states

2040
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,040
and then you're doing a best guess on

2041
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,880
what you should do it's actually

2042
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,280
like action is at the top here the

2043
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,719
policy is at the top

2044
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,239
and so i think that's really a nice

2045
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,400
feature of these models and it becomes

2046
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,600
graphically clear

2047
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,800
and then if somebody wants to have

2048
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,400
philosophical framework a or

2049
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,840
philosophical framework be

2050
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,560
on top of this structure or if they want

2051
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,239
to propose a different structure

2052
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,239
for how observations and policies are

2053
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,440
linked that's

2054
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,960
something great it's something tractable

2055
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,640
that we can talk about but

2056
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,159
this also returns to the metaphor

2057
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,760
discussion this is the real

2058
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,960
thing as it is um cool i know we had to

2059
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
sprint through there but it's just um

2060
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,520
coming near the end of our time so any

2061
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,600
thoughts on these images

2062
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,239
or are people ready to sort of go to our

2063
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:20,880
closing

2064
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,440
thoughts i was just saying the equations

2065
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,719
are more interesting but

2066
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,239
you have to say the equations are

2067
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:29,760
interesting and and

2068
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,880
the 2017 to verizon fristen and this

2069
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,080
model it just reminds uh me that if we

2070
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,600
can write down that bayesian

2071
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,040
relationship the probabilistic

2072
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,880
relationship between variables

2073
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,120
then there's going to be a process model

2074
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,280
that is going to be how we can link it

2075
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,480
and these captions are very informative

2076
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,920
and there's really a lot to

2077
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,280
say here but enough for today

2078
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,159
let's close it out um we can hear any

2079
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,280
last thoughts but

2080
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,880
while people are preparing their last

2081
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,480
thoughts and raising their hand if

2082
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,400
they'd like i would just like to

2083
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,120
thank everyone for participating we're

2084
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,760
learning

2085
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,159
and developing each time figuring out

2086
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,320
the tech each time we

2087
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,159
provide follow-up forms to the live

2088
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,159
participants so just check the calendar

2089
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,199
invitation

2090
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,120
and it would be really helpful to have

2091
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,239
feedback

2092
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,880
we also request feedback suggestions and

2093
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,520
questions

2094
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,840
from the participants live in the

2095
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,880
comments

2096
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,920
or otherwise and uh just stay in

2097
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,719
communication

2098
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,320
we really appreciate everyone's

2099
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,000
engagement here and it's been

2100
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,640
such a great learning experience so if

2101
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,920
anyone wants to raise their hand

2102
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,840
alejandra first and then followed up by

2103
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,280
anyone else who wants to

2104
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,040
let's just have some closing thoughts

2105
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:48,159
[Music]

2106
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,719
well i was wondering if

2107
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,000
if it's possible to like model updating

2108
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,040
if

2109
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,320
when you are doing offline cognition

2110
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,000
um we like without like an explicit

2111
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,239
policy you are not doing something

2112
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,440
online

2113
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,080
when this interaction bodily interaction

2114
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,840
you are thinking about something and

2115
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,440
then you have like this

2116
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,640
uh like you know said like this eureka

2117
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,520
feeling so this this is kind of a model

2118
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,640
updating

2119
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,920
um without action

2120
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,800
um i don't know the short answer is yes

2121
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,760
i just linked the paper to it we uh

2122
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,880
we've created a ruminating agent

2123
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,679
um so basically this agent combines the

2124
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,480
affective

2125
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,679
inference uh scheme that we

2126
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,679
uh have developed over the last two

2127
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,440
years where you're effectively

2128
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,719
inducing a new hierarchical layer of

2129
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,640
state inference based on state and

2130
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,679
precision

2131
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,840
estimates at the lower level and these

2132
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,679
are affective states that then

2133
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,400
guide lower level precision estimation

2134
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,920
so we combine that

2135
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,760
with what's called sophisticated

2136
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,560
inference which is the new generation of

2137
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,239
active inference agents

2138
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,440
um you know vanilla

2139
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,520
formulation current vanilla um

2140
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,880
you could see that in the generative

2141
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,560
models that we just showed

2142
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,840
they include uh beliefs about

2143
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,760
counterfactual observations that we

2144
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,159
would make as we propagate states into

2145
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,120
the future

2146
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,520
sophisticated inference is about

2147
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,199
propagating your beliefs

2148
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,360
about the observations that you would

2149
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,280
make in counterfactual futures

2150
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,440
and so by combining these two things we

2151
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,600
have an agent that isn't acting

2152
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,120
uh but that ends up ruminating um

2153
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,239
and catastrophizing about

2154
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:50,719
uh its own cognition um so i just linked

2155
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,840
the paper in the chat um

2156
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,480
we we submitted it to the uh the

2157
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,000
international workshop on active

2158
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,800
inference uh so the it's a little poster

2159
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,440
now but we're

2160
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,600
we're slowly expanding that into a full

2161
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,840
manuscript but the the kind of summary

2162
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,960
six pager

2163
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,719
uh that just does what you were

2164
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,080
suggesting ale

2165
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,320
is uh this is it yeah

2166
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,159
thank you maxwell um but this is kind of

2167
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,000
confusing with the an active uh

2168
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,600
view of cognition well this is why we're

2169
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,560
not we're not like

2170
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,840
uh classical and activists so yeah we

2171
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,159
reject the equal partners principle

2172
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,600
it's just not the case that uh the body

2173
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,679
uh the brain and the cultural

2174
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,239
like mealier are going to be involved in

2175
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,199
the same way

2176
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,239
for every task so like for rumination

2177
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:49,120
you know you could you could i guess you

2178
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,000
know appeal to a history of interaction

2179
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,480
which is you know the reason why agents

2180
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,000
are able to entertain beliefs about

2181
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,199
other agents at all

2182
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,920
and so on and so forth but yeah you're

2183
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,040
right there isn't much

2184
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,360
in action here and that's fine i think

2185
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,440
uh

2186
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,440
alex kiefer and then anyone else who

2187
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,760
wants to raise their hand

2188
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,400
uh yeah so i guess in lieu of a proper

2189
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:16,880
closing

2190
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,239
statement i just wanted to point out

2191
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,000
that maxwell has some really cool new

2192
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,320
work

2193
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,679
on how the neuronal populations sort of

2194
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,280
can be seen as an acting

2195
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,360
uh inference on their own level and that

2196
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,960
this is one way you could see

2197
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,719
uh structural representations being sort

2198
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,080
of realized so

2199
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,440
like that one thing we didn't have time

2200
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,600
to get into um but i just wanted to say

2201
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,080
in general

2202
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,280
like i think um yeah there is

2203
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,120
i think regardless of the precise

2204
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,719
philosophical take that you have on all

2205
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:43,840
this stuff like

2206
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,360
it's cool to disagree on that level but

2207
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,040
this is this literature has produced

2208
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,480
some really amazing

2209
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,400
work and i think it's it's pushing

2210
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,000
forward in a really interesting way and

2211
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,920
um

2212
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,920
one one advantage of active difference

2213
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,600
certainly is that you can actually write

2214
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,040
down the generative model and

2215
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,880
and sort of transparently see how it

2216
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,360
works and you don't get that out of just

2217
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,320
unsupervised learning

2218
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,760
who any other thoughts

2219
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,800
awesome well thanks so much for the

2220
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,480
discussion we're gonna

2221
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,440
um re-watch understand technologically

2222
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,080
what did

2223
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,719
didn't work and for next week provide

2224
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:23,440
all of you

2225
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,960
plus anyone else who wants to

2226
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,280
participate with more of a specific spec

2227
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,159
sheet for how

2228
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,600
you can prepare and make sure that it

2229
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
will be a really like seamless

2230
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,400
experience

2231
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,040
and as far as the timing goes as well

2232
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,639
next week we will move on to

2233
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,600
active seven which is going to be about

2234
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,280
variational ecology

2235
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,520
which is a really awesome paper close to

2236
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,320
my heart as a biologist as well and we

2237
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,000
would really appreciate anyone who wants

2238
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,960
to participate

2239
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,320
in these conversations next tuesday at 7

2240
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
a.m pacific or the following

2241
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,400
tuesday both of these discussions will

2242
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,800
be really great and it's quite a complex

2243
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
paper so i'm sure we'll have a lot to go

2244
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,000
into again so once again

2245
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,920
thanks so much everyone for your

2246
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,199
participation

2247
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,679
really brought up some awesome ideas and

2248
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,520
i hope we conveyed to those within

2249
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,600
and without of the field that there's a

2250
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,719
lot of discussion

2251
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,040
ongoing by no means are these questions

2252
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,639
resolved and it's an opportunity for

2253
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,000
people to bring their unique

2254
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,280
perspectives to the table

2255
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,520
so thank you all again for your

2256
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,800
participation

2257
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,840
really appreciated and we'll see you

2258
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,840
later
