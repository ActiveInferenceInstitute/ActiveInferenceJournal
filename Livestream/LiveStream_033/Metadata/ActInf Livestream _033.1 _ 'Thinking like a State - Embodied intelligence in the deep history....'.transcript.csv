"Speaker 1","00;00;31;05","00;01;03;16","All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Active Lab. Livestream number 33.1. It's November 23rd 2021 welcome to the Active Lab, a first time participants and returning participants and listeners. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;04;12","00;01;31;06","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following good video etiquette for live streams. We are in the final two weeks of November. 21 discussing thinking like a state paper of choice and we have some tentative paper selections for number 34 and likely will take a break and start with 35 in the beginning of January 22."
"Speaker 1","00;01;31;25","00;01;57;16","But we're really looking forward to an exciting 2022 so if you have any ideas for people to invite for other streams or if you yourself would like to join then just let us know today. Inactive stream number 33.1 we're going to be learning and discussing this very cool paper thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds by a case survey."
"Speaker 1","00;01;57;16","00;02;33;11","I'll go ahead and call it and it's just a discussion video, even though we have the author on the stream, which is awesome, we're pretty much in the dark one going to go over anything that we want to. We can return to some keywords and bigger questions that we raised in the zero. We can add notes for next steps for questions to think about over the coming week to touch on again in the to or possible ways somebody could continue this avenue of research and we will be discussing this paper in next week, 33.2."
"Speaker 1","00;02;35;01","00;03;00;03","OK, we'll go around and introduce our panel today. Everyone can give just a short check in. They can say hello and something that they remembered from the paper or something that they were excited about to discuss and then pass it to someone who hasn't spoken. And then we'll conclude with the author. So I'll start. I'm Daniel I'm in California."
"Speaker 1","00;03;00;09","00;03;13;20","And just as we were discussing right before we started, I want to explore this aspect of states as anticipate Tory cognizance, not just reactive cognizance. And I'll pass it to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;03;15;23","00;03;39;22","I am Dean in British Columbia and ensconced in a cedar box today, but in my cabin and I like the paper because I want to see whether or not there are parallels between what happens on an individual level, what happens on more organized levels of individuals. And I'll pass it over to Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;03;43;06","00;04;15;26","Good morning or good whatever time of day it is in your world. Everyone, I'm Blue Knight. I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico. And I like this paper for many reasons. But my favorite reason is the scale three aspect of self-assembly. So it's self-assembly at a much larger scale than I'm used to. I normally study cells and sub cellular organizations, so I like how active inference unites the things that I like to study with state hood and larger scale organizations."
"Speaker 3","00;04;16;09","00;04;19;10","And I will pass it over to first time participant and."
"Speaker 4","00;04;21;08","00;04;49;08","Hello, everybody. My name is Andy. I'm in Richmond, Virginia. I'm very good at the mechanics of how intelligence works through a collective, but are there universal things that we can do? We can apply broadly to the movement of information through relatively closed systems and and how to modify that, the cognition that goes along with it. And I will pass it along to Stephen."
"Speaker 5","00;04;52;01","00;05;45;29","Hello and good morning, Stephen, here in Toronto. Yeah, I'm interested in this paper in terms of the scale of the social impacts of of looking at states and how active inference scales up and also maybe a little bit provocation in terms of like how much are we looking at the, the dynamic states of organisms or macro organisms and how much we looking at the state of the dead set of artifacts that helps us work with our niche and the scale of working with macro artifacts in the niche, as much as macro cognitive agents so I'll be interested about that and I'll pass it, I believe, to Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;05;47;12","00;06;01;21","Thank you, Stephen. I think we've all we nine authors have gone so survival would be awesome. Just to kind of recap, hello and what brought you to writing this paper as we kick off the discussion."
"Speaker 4","00;06;04;25","00;06;27;24","So hello my name is and also Vola. I'm trained in physics epistemology where things and what interested for this paper is to show that we you accept a materialist and a thing of recognition which is a saying that is based on natural systems, actual dynamics. Then we can't resist the conclusion that social systems are organized in a way that is cognitive."
"Speaker 4","00;06;28;18","00;07;01;24","And I found this as a conservation is important because there there are no limits like systems with our cognitive work in the way they are structured to work. And we can, we can change a thing and we can understand how change will affect how the thing behave, which is but to your genes because I think it's pretty likely that the natural state systems, that system in today's Western states capitalism system is dying and is basically bringing us with it."
"Speaker 4","00;07;02;07","00;07;16;29","So we have to explore the state of alternatives pretty quickly and efficiently. And this is reflected in the studying on what the Subspaces are great."
"Speaker 1","00;07;17;00","00;07;48;03","And I think it's, it's a pun or homonym that will return many times. What are the states because we talk about partitioning of states a lot in active inference, internal blanket, external nested systems and now we're talking about the nation states of how are social systems cognitive. We use that state based partitioning to talk about other cognitive systems, ones that are designed or evolved."
"Speaker 1","00;07;48;19","00;08;05;26","And so we're applying active inference to study the cognitive properties of states Stephen and then anyone else. And I'll just keep on adding notes or questions and people can look at it or suggest things in life. Yeah, go ahead, Stephen. Thank you."
"Speaker 5","00;08;06;29","00;08;41;02","Yeah. I think it's also cool with active inference is that kind of ontological challenge whereby we're dealing with non equilibrium dynamic states in a nonlinear system which gives rise to pull back attractors which have this non equilibrium steady state quality, where however often states are or say we think in quantum theory or something you know, they're like it goes from this particular state to that particular state."
"Speaker 5","00;08;41;02","00;08;57;09","Right? So there's, there's also that interpretation of what can be done with states when you start to have nonlinear dynamics at play thanks."
"Speaker 3","00;08;57;10","00;09;27;23","Blue So something that I mentioned in the zero video that I'm interested in maybe exploring a little bit deeper is like what do states aggregate into so what is like the grander scale? We're all just self-assembling into something and, and the quantity of states that are produced. I can't remember who said it. Maybe it was though that states like arise as a result of war and faction and division."
"Speaker 3","00;09;27;23","00;09;55;15","And so as we are progressing forward in time, there's an increased amount of faction and division and like it doesn't matter how homogenous a population is, they will find something to divide about. And so like this creates more city states within city states, within certain states. So is there some kind of equilibrium like attractor space for like the optimal number of states or is it all going to be like unified or is it all going to be dissolved at some point?"
"Speaker 1","00;09;58;15","00;09;59;06","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 5","00;10;01;00","00;10;31;08","That's a good point. There is also something interesting about democracy. They say that for democracy to work it almost has to be a split of around 45 to 50 between different opinions parties. Otherwise, like if basically one party's supported by 65 70% of the people generally speaking, it doesn't work very well because then there's no, there's no dynamic as opposed to move backwards and forwards."
"Speaker 5","00;10;32;16","00;10;34;24","So I think that's quite interesting."
"Speaker 3","00;10;36;22","00;11;04;12","But so when we talk about the minimum number of like states or entities to exist for democracy to function opinions it's interesting, you know in the system that Mike Levin works with back from our July livestream, The Computational Boundary of a Self, he works in plenary, which I read generating organisms but you have to have a minimum number of cells and particularly like a minimum number of stem cells."
"Speaker 3","00;11;04;18","00;11;31;05","So I think it's like a thousand cells at base and it's like 120 plenary in stem cells or you don't get regeneration. And so like what kind of dynamic is required or how many people? And even for like you talk about hunter gatherer organizations like 50 to 500 people they think made like an optimal hunter gatherer colony, like less than 50 and you're going to be eaten by coyotes or whatever so where is that optimal number in state?"
"Speaker 3","00;11;31;11","00;11;32;17","What does that look like?"
"Speaker 1","00;11;33;08","00;12;08;27","Yeah. What aspects of the system are necessary, sufficient are incompatible at odds with certain kinds of regimes of state. And it is really funny how we talk about policy selection policy sounds like it'd be more from international policy than it would be from reaching for your cup of water. And then we talk about regimes of attention. Usually people hear regime, they're thinking some historical regime of a state, whereas regime of attention doesn't necessarily carry that connotation."
"Speaker 1","00;12;09;17","00;12;32;20","So linguistically there's a lot of contact points, and that's why I think it was an awesome contribution by civil was to just draw those out, ground it in the physics of critical systems and of cognitive systems. And that's what is contributing to hopefully some of the ways we'll explore it's going to be used going forward. So Dean and then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;12;35;20","00;13;11;04","Yeah, this this might sound like pushback or challenge or whatever, but it's just I have a personal issue with the entire idea of scale free like that. There's some sort of invariance across scales. And I, I think that like when we see, for example, a lowercase a morph into an uppercase A, even though they are of the same categorical type and fit in the same place in the alphabet, there is a, there is a change that goes on."
"Speaker 2","00;13;11;04","00;13;46;18","And so there is a scale variance aspect to this that I think. So again, this is my, my sense of it as opposed to sort of the agreed sense that there's a scale free process in play. The other thing I would I would wonder a little bit about is when we take a constructivist view, a city as built I'm not sure what happens to the by directionality that act of inference affords."
"Speaker 2","00;13;47;21","00;14;09;12","So again, I am not saying that we can't find qualities in both, but I'm not sure that a city as a reflection of something constructivists is necessarily how living things reflect and predict. But again, I'm open to having my mind changed."
"Speaker 1","00;14;10;24","00;14;14;13","Thanks, Dean. Stephen. And then I'll have a comment on the Constructivism."
"Speaker 5","00;14;16;18","00;14;55;14","Now, I was just also I think it's a good point we blew about the Mike Levin's work and the the question of how things are scaling up and of course, the big thing that Mike Levin did mention that, you know, they they've got these quite a lot of ideas around how things grow, multiply and relate, but no idea how they stop and that's kind of also interesting in terms of, you know, when we think about scale is like has the organism reached its point because the top scale, the maximum scale has kind of been reached or is there some sort of is it there's it's the dynamics amidst mid-scale, which is like an action scale."
"Speaker 5","00;14;56;00","00;15;20;16","So it's not it's not that these have ever arrived at this thing. It's just arrived at this MIT me. So actually policy landscape, which is available and you know, is that availability then understood from what's inside or is it something that's checked is something external in the environment so that that I think is an interesting question thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;15;21;24","00;15;49;09","Capitalizations. Yeah you have to the state capital capital punishment. There's so many other funny word place but to the constructivist comment so one sort of simple constructivism would be like, I mean, there weren't bricks there and now there are. So the city was constructed and now it's the scaffold for us to interact in. So you asked Dean, where's that by directionality."
"Speaker 1","00;15;49;26","00;16;15;22","So I think there's a few ways to talk about the by directionality. So first is each construction can be a symmetric relationship. We talk about the agents modifying the niche and the niche is modifying the agent and so it's like you have the blanket as the interface. And then there are action and inference on both sides of the blanket being used as a as an interface."
"Speaker 1","00;16;16;03","00;17;04;02","And so it's more like a code constructionism. But if, you know, Lego set A is building B while B is building A that starts looking more like interaction ism because it's not just instructions. Put the brick here, it's a specification of a protocol and an interface for interaction. And that's what opens the door to Improvization and to other kinds of dynamics that aren't just simply like assembly of the 3D printer and then the other point and then Dean is it reminds me of Dennis 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea where he talks about basically two ways that you can talk about the appearance of design in natural systems which are cranes and skyhooks and so if"
"Speaker 1","00;17;04;02","00;17;24;04","you look at a skyscraper you think, how could that have appeared? One approach is they built a crane to put that last top piece on and if that crane was too big to construct then a smaller crane built that crane. So you can have a cranes all the way down like small things were built and scaffolds were in place that were removed later to result in this skyscraper."
"Speaker 1","00;17;24;21","00;17;49;09","Or you can just cut the knot and just say, well, maybe there was a skyhook and they just latched it to the sky and then built it down so that's like top down. Constructivism appeals to skyhook technology, whereas bottom up emergent process based co constructivism is more of a crane based approach. So I think that's a very good point."
"Speaker 1","00;17;49;09","00;18;05;19","How even with Constructivism, we can still retain a lot of the important aspects of constructivism like physical construction. But we don't need to fall into a uni directional or a top down trap. So Dean, what do you think about that? And then Steven or anyone else."
"Speaker 2","00;18;10;16","00;18;35;19","I think I think the important point, Daniel, is what you just mentioned, which is the trap of premature alley collapsing to the top down privilege. For example, if you go to if you go to it just outside of Denver, you end up in a place called Red Rocks. And then the question becomes did did did somebody enact Red Rocks?"
"Speaker 2","00;18;35;19","00;18;58;13","Because they put a stage at the base of an amphitheater or did Red Rocks enact everybody who was attracted to that place? And so all I'm basically suggesting is, is is when we look at how things are constructed, we don't want to lose sight of the fact that sometimes things construct us as well. Sort of the skyhooks aspect of it."
"Speaker 1","00;19;00;26","00;19;01;14","Thank you, Dean."
"Speaker 5","00;19;01;17","00;19;29;03","Stephen Yeah. And also, I mean, cranes and Skyhooks, it gives that idea of how it links in. They're also dead items, right? So they're both tools. So they're both objects. So and we can we can bring in Skyhooks, which might be information, instructions or cranes, which are, you know, places to carry the bricks that are going to build things."
"Speaker 5","00;19;29;17","00;20;12;11","But I think that when we talk about that mark of blanket and what goes both ways is, yes, I think when we did in particular, we did things like bricks in that we construct an environment that's a bit more complicated when we impact the environment, there also grows and changes and is alive. However, when something comes back the other way from the environment is it constructs in us or is it scarring us or is it giving us lots of little punches in the gut in which we heal So I'm wondering whether the other direction it can't construct us, but what don't kill us makes us stronger type of thing."
"Speaker 1","00;20;14;16","00;20;17;04","Thanks, Stephen. Andy, please."
"Speaker 4","00;20;17;20","00;20;41;22","And then I think in the context of cognition and the state, the specific the element that's missing, right. Is what's the relationship between the nation and the state, right? So the nation would be the bottom up information of the bottom up cognition. And the state could be theorized now is the top down. And then, broadly speaking, right, the nation creates the state."
"Speaker 4","00;20;42;10","00;21;04;14","The state, the existence of the state changes the circumstance. The changes in circumstance forces the nation, the nation, the people to rethink how they're operating in the world around them because their circumstances have been modified. And now you have this constant bi directional relationship between bottom up and top down in the context of state versus nation and modifying circumstance over time."
"Speaker 1","00;21;06;16","00;21;07;25","Thank you, Luke."
"Speaker 3","00;21;08;19","00;21;08;26","Dean."
"Speaker 1","00;21;09;22","00;21;09;29","Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;21;10;28","00;21;37;00","Yeah. And I like what you're saying, except which already collapsed to an aid B relationship. And I think what active inference allows for is to keep things up on a on a generalized, abstracted level. It doesn't have to be here's the nation A and here's the people B, That's the difference essentially is if you want it to be an A and B, thing, go ahead."
"Speaker 2","00;21;37;00","00;21;59;00","That's that's good for argument's sake. But in fact, what active inference does is it keeps one side of this open and not necessarily specific. It keeps it in order to be predictable, it asks the counterfactual, what if as opposed to having that pre presented as the relationship."
"Speaker 1","00;22;01;20","00;22;27;20","And it's new. It's a new type of relationship that's arising. And I think that's right explored in the paper in the deep history section. There's really the specifics, there's the particulars of the specific states that we have and typified by Westphalia and a bunch of other historical events that the specifics matter. We're in a complex system. The trajectory really does matter."
"Speaker 3","00;22;28;08","00;22;52;24","Blue so I totally forgot what I was going to say, but I would like to maybe challenge Andy, like what is the difference between the nation and the state? Is the nation like the people that make up the state and then the state is like the collective of the people. Like is it like a part whole concept or are they two separate, larger entities?"
"Speaker 3","00;22;52;24","00;22;57;08","And people make up both groups um."
"Speaker 4","00;22;57;27","00;23;31;20","So the words, depending on which definitions you go with, right? It gets a little bit squishy in the context that I use them state is a construct, the political organization of a people. It's is downstream of the shared identity of the people, of a people. So the nation would be broadly the largest sense of shared self distributed among relatively close system in this regard and the state being the construct by which these people organize their affairs inside of their nation."
"Speaker 4","00;23;32;20","00;23;56;06","That's a relatively new idea the idea of a nation and the nation state is relatively new as far as like an overt construction beforehand. And in the age of absolute monarchy, there was no separation between the state and the people. It was all the body then the person of the sovereign. So a different, different historical context different periods of time, different cultural context."
"Speaker 4","00;23;56;06","00;24;15;14","Now you might get different definitions, but in the the way in which I was using it, the state would be a policy requirement of the culture in which it was born. Right. It's why American democracy functioned significantly better than South Sudanese democracy, even though they have literally the exact same institutions."
"Speaker 3","00;24;18;01","00;24;45;04","So then maybe you want to flip to slide 33. I think like where we like kind of show in the paper all of the things that go into the production of a state. And so I was like, I'm curious as to like where nation fits into this. Is it like the in the collective identity or is it like a relationship between like nation and collective identity or just what your thoughts are on that."
"Speaker 4","00;24;47;03","00;25;08;10","Yeah, absolutely. Collective identity to me would be the definition of a nation, shared sense of self. Everything else are things that you may or may not need a state to accomplish. That may or may not be more officially conducted in the auspices of a state. Right. Control the monetary flow. You probably need something as sophisticated as a state, but to transfer resources back and forth don't."
"Speaker 4","00;25;08;28","00;25;14;09","But you can you can grow grain and you can you can trade it for for me. Go ahead."
"Speaker 1","00;25;15;04","00;25;58;00","Well, it's just the collective identity of just thinking about an organism and the liver and, you know, the bones. So it's like collective identity doesn't mean identical phenotype. And so makes me think of a cultural memory where each person maybe there's a few touchstones that 80% of people know about or increasingly, though, there's less and less shared information amidst the informational changes that are happening so what does that mean when everyone's only going to have a little partial facet of the collective memory on board, but maybe they can enact broader processes that are truly collective."
"Speaker 1","00;25;58;11","00;26;11;07","So how do we respect differences and shared aspects across multiple levels? So Blue and Dean and then survival. I want to hear what you're thinking about this."
"Speaker 3","00;26;12;28","00;26;37;24","So just like Daniel how you were talking about like the bone and the liver, so like making up an organism, you know, I think that that speaks here to what's the specialized roles and like the density of settlements enables that like functional specialization and like you can have a blacksmith and a shoemaker and a farmer and everybody takes on their own little role and then goods can be redistributed."
"Speaker 3","00;26;37;24","00;26;43;14","So it just like reminded me of that and like that functional specialization and the importance of it."
"Speaker 1","00;26;44;21","00;26;48;16","Thank you, Blue Dean. And then survival or perhaps."
"Speaker 2","00;26;50;26","00;27;22;23","Yeah, when I was watching the 33 zero and I saw this slide, thank you for asking for it to be brought brought back again here. This is again a specific to a specific because it's historical and it's reflective and the fact that we can look at things and say, this is what happened, we can look back on them, I'm not sure we want to necessarily conflate that with act of inference, which is about the recursion so this is what happened."
"Speaker 2","00;27;23;06","00;28;01;21","We can see how things moved to across a timeline from point A to point B city state evolved. But is that recursion, which is what active interest is about, which is variation upon variation? I'm not again, I ask is that I know how we can I know how we can diagram it and represent it. But is that representative of what actually occurs in recursion when certain thresholds appear and then just as quickly disappear interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;28;01;21","00;28;06;08","So serval if you'd like to add anything and then Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;28;07;28","00;28;12;10","So there are a lot of threads of corruptions. What are you asking about?"
"Speaker 1","00;28;14;06","00;28;30;20","I think part would be just on nation and state similarities, differences, what is and what is and then more on this sort of integration slide where does active inference come into this tying of the not."
"Speaker 4","00;28;33;10","00;29;02;29","How does that influence about creation? I don't think it does. Nation is simply collective identity. That is insight into a political entity. It's a community of ears that happen to have some states power over the behavior of institution but your states and the fact is that nation are not universal evaporative states that are not nation states that are not city to individuals."
"Speaker 4","00;29;03;01","00;29;45;05","For example, the Roman Empire, it was empire, which means that you have people who get the power that form against a group that's easy river and you have all the rest of the people that exist in there that are ruled by the by the empire that is dominated by the Romans. So you do not have a community of interests that incited to a states you are not in group that dominates other ethnic groups through a state nation, are not they are not in various aspects of what the state is."
"Speaker 4","00;29;45;28","00;30;45;03","However, they are in collective identity or at least ways to build boundaries between them. We'll go up and admit there seem to be an invariant of efficient human collective action, according to us from principles so there may be more tenancy to relations with nation states when you have more important between groups election. And it is said that I don't know of any group that works at its best you said that's modern Europe is pretty extreme in terms of of between group conflicts of four because the German government is that the geography basically enables trade are good scandals but prevents the constitution of an empire in Europe."
"Speaker 4","00;30;45;27","00;31;23;02","And so historically there were a lot of states in Europe as compared say in China where you have a big state that is, I don't know in terms of suffixes maybe two or three times like Western Europe is and more integrated than when you can have in South America because of the things so you have a potato regime against a lot of intergroup conflicts and to get sanction regime, that's for those nations, organizations that somehow collide with states and that's what's happened to been settled."
"Speaker 4","00;31;23;02","00;32;07;13","So I don't know Westphalia approach abolition. I don't know the story of that. There are a lot of pathways in Europe pushing states, but in Europe you got nation states represented. You've got pretty aggressive kinds of representative societies and both can be traced, I think, to an intense regime of between groups of action and of war. And Europe results that tend to say that war explains in that sense predicts more political complexity, which is a debatable construct that basically maps the scale of integration of a sighted stone."
"Speaker 4","00;32;09;00","00;32;32;12","The history of Europe of modern Europe, specifically a majority of post the Roman Empire would have selected for both nations and aggressive kinds of imperialism. And this is the kind of feminization that we get to live in thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;32;32;27","00;33;02;17","Survival, just like the ecological regularities through evolutionary time scaffold the evolution of an organism's cognition. This is a transposition of that argument to the bio, geographical and contextual and ecological factors. That give rise to and scaffold the development of states as things as cognitive entities. There are some parallels there, so it's an awesome point. Thank you, blue. And then Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;33;04;05","00;33;04;11","Smith."
"Speaker 1","00;33;04;13","00;33;04;26","Yes, yes."
"Speaker 4","00;33;05;19","00;33;36;20","There is pretty important things you said that states does not happen to a nation, maybe states of all nations. Maybe they are isolated nations. No bunch of states I mean, not entirely a nation of states, of specialists, of population, of states. Well, that's kind of the usual deal actually. So, you know, a nation is a collective identity of being a community."
"Speaker 4","00;33;36;20","00;33;53;25","Our interests state is control systems build from any social and can be and often is captured by the elites, but is technically social like socially and in terms of control, those puts distinct from the people that controls."
"Speaker 1","00;33;55;18","00;34;08;28","Chicken in the egg. Egg as the secreted state chicken as the life form. But then there's a co-evolution. So that paradox stands there to blue Steven and Andy."
"Speaker 3","00;34;09;28","00;34;12;18","I'm going to defer and come back around to my yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;34;12;27","00;34;14;14","So Steven and then Andy."
"Speaker 5","00;34;16;20","00;34;43;10","Yeah I think the the whole scale questions very interesting here and where we sort of so often I mean in the European Union you've got the European Union is kind of we're a union of pluralistic partners is the idea. And you've got this tension where one side is basically saying no you're not us state. We want to be a nation, an independent nation, as is tension right now."
"Speaker 5","00;34;43;10","00;35;07;05","We're a union. We're a union of and when actions are work that works the union right. And so I think that there's a scale where people try and work and and the rate at which people work at what's the dynamics of people in the same way that when you have politics seems to have a very slow trajectory. You know, things shift."
"Speaker 5","00;35;07;05","00;35;28;26","You have the state, you have the identity of your party. However near in an election a week, this phrase is a week is a long time in politics and it is near an election. The dynamics start to become much faster. Things can change much quicker. So this scale question again comes in is what is what is a unit of identity?"
"Speaker 5","00;35;29;05","00;35;59;08","How does it manifest at different rates? And just one other thing in terms of identities in participatory community based action research. OK, they talk about communities, actually a unit of identity. It's almost like there's so many different types of fluidity at the community level and overlaps between communities that it becomes a unit of identity to actually work with in measuring stuff."
"Speaker 5","00;35;59;29","00;36;18;27","We tend not to do that at the higher level of the nation. It's just the flag is a unit of identity. It's a very which hasn't maybe changed in a hundred years. So is an interesting as well is that, you know what? How much can things change and how much of the ability things to change caught up in the artifacts that embody them."
"Speaker 1","00;36;21;27","00;36;31;20","The artifacts that constitute them in some case. So Andy any comments or to blue yes."
"Speaker 4","00;36;31;20","00;37;04;01","Thank you. So I was going to just go through with what you just said. Right smallest action element of action in this context. Identity is the smallest element of action. However, it is guided or bounded right by its ability to affect change. So if you if you deeply identify with one other person in this world, the two of you are the small that you have, you identity becomes basically shorthand for interest."
"Speaker 4","00;37;04;04","00;37;34;15","We two people, by calling ourselves a group, have a certain worldview and a certain desire to see our interests achieved. We have the capacity of two people to accomplish that. So what is our ability to affect change at that scale? Relatively small. What you're talking about anything larger than interpersonal relationships, right? But it doesn't change the fact that your identity is shorthand for your interests and that we all at whatever level or scale we're operating at are pursuing our interests to the best of our ability bounded by relative power."
"Speaker 4","00;37;35;00","00;38;08;16","Right. But this idea of nation versus statehood survival, you're absolutely right. The state is a thing independent of a nation. Sometimes they correspond and typically we see that that is that that's a good fit because otherwise it's an empire, right? Otherwise it is somebody else's ideas of what constitutes right and wrong in terms of projected values or institutionalized values that are now imposed on you because the state is not representative of your cultural worldview or your shared identity."
"Speaker 4","00;38;08;22","00;38;29;09","It is something provided to you by somebody else's in the form of empire. But the question that I had going through the slides there was this idea that the state as a top down hierarchical control system, what is then nation or what is that identity? How does that function in the sharing of information and cognition? Relative to the state."
"Speaker 1","00;38;32;01","00;38;47;24","Thanks for the tax driven question. It was a core argument of the article, just to quote, that states can be and should be understood as hierarchical control systems. So I felt if you want to give a direct response, otherwise, Dean Blue."
"Speaker 4","00;38;50;07","00;39;14;26","There is a direct response, which is that talk of a vehicle control system as opposed to going to talk of the Bill of control. This is, I think, I reframe the same point, the same thing in terms of both words. And of course, there is no cognitive system response he speaks of them that are they do not work live in labs and they are not useful."
"Speaker 4","00;39;16;05","00;40;13;20","So basically the organic organization of whoever happens to have a say in what the status is, is the artist. They are sending in the collective bargaining with affect in basin terms, what the change, the priorities and the policies starts, etc. So in the case where you have defined mission defined entity, what happens in the states, which I'd say is exceptional from what I read, you can't say that there is a meaningful nation state since the nation, specifically the brain and body of the state, the sense that well, the ascending that I mean that reference what the control systems does in most cases we are all right, so proceed much stronger decoupling because basically only elites"
"Speaker 4","00;40;13;20","00;40;48;15","would get a say in to say those insights were you must say it is the elite is not a defining ethnic group in that case you will not have a clear faith between a nation and states although of course the guarantee of power that defined a state each conceived of nation will defines what the states are. Well, perspective define because of course that on the top the to."
"Speaker 1","00;40;49;29","00;40;54;14","Thank you so awesome lot of hands so Dean then blue Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;40;57;01","00;41;27;07","So I want to just circle back to what Andy just said Andy when you if if you go and look at this live stream 3 hours from now even when you see a perfect reflection will assume that this YouTube video comes out exactly as as it intended I think what you just said proves that we're not talking about scale free talking about scale friendly because what you will see is not what you just did."
"Speaker 2","00;41;28;09","00;41;56;06","And so I think that that has a huge bearing on this idea of what we're talking about here. We can shapeshift into what Steven Celente has pointed out here is that that fact that we can fill between these two levels of scale doesn't mean that it's it's one size fits all. It quite literally means is that we can fill we can change, we can modify."
"Speaker 2","00;41;56;25","00;42;14;00","And I think that's recursion in its essence, as opposed to taking a reflection and knowing that the next time we look at that, it's going to be different because there's some elapsed time between the moment we reset it and then the moment we heard ourselves say it."
"Speaker 1","00;42;15;17","00;42;38;01","Dean, I think that's an awesome point. With scale free and scale friendly, scale free people usually mean to say that the mathematics or the formalism doesn't have an a priori system of interest or scale like this is a centimeter theory or this is a kilometer theory. So it's scale free because it doesn't have that a priori reference scale, but then scale friendly."
"Speaker 1","00;42;38;12","00;43;03;15","It's almost like, how about you tell me what scales you've identified and let's make them friends through interaction and iterated modeling. And so we're friendly to scale and scaling, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's free. Although from the other side, it's also fair to say that it's a scale free framework in the way that a Bayesian computational framework or even a linear model is scale free."
"Speaker 1","00;43;03;19","00;43;10;15","It doesn't Apriori say that KILOMETER is the default unit for linear regression, either blue and then steep."
"Speaker 3","00;43;13;15","00;43;43;24","So I think what I'm going to say is going to touch on the comments that were made by both Andy and Savile. First of all, in terms of this relationship up like the mutual interest being the fundamental unit of identity and collective identity, this really goes back to expansion of your cognitive boundary beyond yourself. And like when we were talking about the computational boundary of self, again, I'm going to always refer to that livestream, but there's an informational sharing when there's an identity sharing."
"Speaker 3","00;43;44;00","00;44;00;12","So when you expand your cognitive boundary to include more than just yourself, like if you have like a really deep connection, a really deep relationship with one person, you have like a great degree of mutual information between you and that one person. And then so say you have like a family unit or like a network of close friends."
"Speaker 3","00;44;00;17","00;44;44;28","There is a lot a large degree of informational sharing. And so in this sense of building a nation like the fundamental unit of identity that maybe is is actually informational. So it goes back to like Bayesian principles where there's this informational sharing that that then allows you to update your generative model. So just to kind of speak to that and then also maybe to just like maybe help Andy make the link between downward causation imposed by like a government or like a hierarchical control institution and like the emergence that happens, like when people come together and share information in a collective."
"Speaker 3","00;44;45;05","00;45;07;00","There's a super cool paper by David Krakauer called The Information Theory of Individuality and it talks about like in order to become an individual and there are many different kinds of individuals, but in order to become an individual, there has to be like a bi directional information flow that's both emergent, starting with like the fundamental units, like the people sharing information, there's an emergent and then a top down."
"Speaker 3","00;45;07;00","00;45;19;21","So bottom up and top down. And like when you have this bi directional information flow, that's like what allows you to form a boundary, I guess around your collective, something like that."
"Speaker 1","00;45;20;27","00;45;24;21","Thank you, Blue Stephen. And then anyone else."
"Speaker 5","00;45;27;12","00;45;58;12","Yeah, I so picking up on what Dean said that and so yeah, there's an actually blue and everyone else's, the formalism is scaled free at the free energy principle and then you get into Applied Act. So then you get into active inference which has a sort of a scale free quality. And then you get into adaptive active inference and then you get into, you know, in action of adaptive active inference."
"Speaker 5","00;45;58;12","00;46;18;07","And then you get organisms like us that want to apply active inference. And I think that I think it does like really start to go scale friendly once you start to go up. And one thing that I find interesting I've been this actually is nice to ties into this infusion space work that I do. But I look at the face and the body."
"Speaker 5","00;46;18;07","00;46;45;26","So at there's a particular scale at which my mind is embodied and you can see it. And the bit that you see is the bit that we show on this screen. You're not looking at my foot or my shoulder or my hands. You're looking at the face. The face is the embodiment of my mind as an identity, OK?"
"Speaker 5","00;46;45;26","00;47;09;26","This is my projective identity and it becomes very useful. So it's scale friendly at that scale. But you know, until the other scales of my body on my liver, it doesn't do a great job of my identity. OK, and then we go, OK, what scale do I have to get to? I'm talking about if I'm just talking one on one, I don't sit here waving a Canadian flag or whatever right now."
"Speaker 5","00;47;09;26","00;47;31;08","If I'm a crowd of a thousands now, maybe we need to have a big flag on a stick. Right? And that becomes my face. Right? That becomes my projection. But that's a scale friendly because now I've again, it's kind of gone in and recapitulated in the environment. So that's kind of interesting. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;47;31;26","00;47;32;23","Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;47;33;11","00;48;13;10","All I hopefully gets for debates about skills based kind of trying new thing because what a skill story is is a series of this principle of analysis understand principle. It's got a different scale. So for example, in opposition to the weak and strong forces that only have a measurable effect at very small special scales, gravitation and electromagnetism that can influence things but that are pretty much a a lot of as many some because you have the more containing of plus and minus charges."
"Speaker 4","00;48;13;10","00;48;41;06","But in principle, it could affect things at a distance because of the error square and see what's going and the fact that you have a theory that is culprit those notes and time that every system that where you expose the theory is calculus. For example, you have the repetition theory versus go free. But if you study the solar system as it a scale which is about a distance from the sun."
"Speaker 4","00;48;41;07","00;49;07;28","And the first thing about this, you study electromagnetic motor. It has a scalar which is the size of the matter. And if you study ideological organism, we first get a pre formalism because of scatter, which is what the scale at which the organism happens to exist. So I don't get what the debate is about Dean."
"Speaker 1","00;49;08;19","00;49;10;15","How about you give a thought on that?"
"Speaker 2","00;49;11;18","00;49;31;01","Yeah, I got a thought on that. So I think we can see what a reflection is. We can see what a triangle is, we can see a very small triangle and we can see a very large one. Those are reflections, but that is not recursion. And as soon as you get into variability upon variability, you're going to have to come up with something more than a reflection."
"Speaker 2","00;49;31;23","00;49;49;10","And I think that's why you have to come up with something that more than scale free I mean, we can see scale free and nobody's arguing against that. But what we're I guess what I'm pointing out is that if we limit ourselves to that, we're not going to see the entire picture."
"Speaker 1","00;49;51;27","00;50;21;14","All kind of intermediate. I think it's they're both very valuable views. Scale free is certainly more aligned with the way that people do talk about formal models, whereas scale friendly is a little more of a dean ism, which is always fun. I see skill friendly as emphasizing the active role of the modeler in connecting the levels. So it's not enough to just say like, I have a stretchy ruler that could apply to different scales."
"Speaker 1","00;50;21;14","00;50;55;15","It's not an apriori scaled ruler. And then making it more of this process of approaching the mechanisms and the processes is that are interacting among scales rather than just thinking, Well, we'll put the linear regression on a little thing, we'll put the linear regression on the big thing, and then we'll have a scale free applied theory. This is more like, let's take that system as a Indivisible unit of function and then like interact with it in a little bit more of an active way."
"Speaker 1","00;50;56;15","00;51;06;27","And it can still be scale free for those who like that way of talking about it. But for those who want to get to know it, maybe scale friendly is approachable as well."
"Speaker 5","00;51;07;19","00;51;40;24","Stephen Yeah. I think there's also active inference and adaptive active inference and inactive inference. So I think then made a good point as keeping the active inference flow through and helping that is really useful so that we don't lose the formalism side because that's the danger, right? We but, but there is something for instance, at what point is that to active inference possible?"
"Speaker 5","00;51;41;04","00;52;12;05","Like is that the point when you need to have the brain within a reason or there needs to be there needs to be some generative process that's regulating active inference which then at that different temporal scales now that that raises some other questions about exactly where. But there's the, you know, even the idea of what adaptive active inference and active active inference or adaptive an active potentially is starts to then tie in."
"Speaker 5","00;52;12;05","00;52;28;27","Well, you know, if I can only do some adaptive active inference with the brain, then that's be the scale of an organism that has a brain. And below that scale, it can't. So there's something that becomes transitionary or contextual."
"Speaker 1","00;52;31;05","00;52;35;02","Dean on this point and then to sort of offer a combined response."
"Speaker 2","00;52;36;27","00;53;10;15","Yeah. So again, I think knowing that a triangle is a triangle, regardless of the volume of its footprint is is important. I think when we include updating, when we include time, then we should include scale friendly. So not discounting scale free. But I'm saying that the updating process whether you want to call that adaptation or inaction, the change aspect of it doesn't get resolved simply because a triangle is a triangle."
"Speaker 2","00;53;11;11","00;53;12;07","That makes sense."
"Speaker 1","00;53;14;10","00;53;33;13","Bucky Fuller said Angle is, is metaphysical and general. It doesn't refer to any specific substrate to say that something is a 60 degree angle and frequency is always bound up in space and time and the specifics. So any realized system is going to be both survival."
"Speaker 4","00;53;37;20","00;54;33;16","So Steve, I think talk about selecting friends to action friends is something that I've just shot introducing my 2018. I think something about tries to reproduce adaptive notions of cognition inference. What it says is that you have agency when you have hierarchical aggregation of actual inferences to you have higher level of confronts that relates and one of them affects you inference the question to raise is basically a question that is not solved and I don't even know what site it's in the ontology of science and naturalism, which is throughout different level of existence or do we have only scales and even at this level, when we admit that we have things within things, within things,"
"Speaker 4","00;54;33;16","00;55;01;23","within things, and that's what the world is, it's complicated the thing is, that's true. Circle back to a question that has been raised initially about how much inference relates to are both of those conditional the right use of true tries to formalize and active concepts of commission is entirely wrong because in activists they do not say that organisms are electrically modulated."
"Speaker 4","00;55;02;17","00;55;37;29","Think it to say that the brain is again modulated and they are projecting itself into this. Let me say that's a system that is cognitive must be operationally closed which is it has a set of it has a structure on organization. I don't know which because of their consumption, that's basically reproduce its existence without any clear supports, without falling asleep from its environments."
"Speaker 4","00;55;38;27","00;56;04;25","That's not how this works. Whatever. And you have a specific population that does know it was formulated by people from the center of social sciences. I think the name is, which is concert cluster. So you have constraints that are so processes that shape how fast substances behave and you have a lot of them. And collectively, these lot of constraints shape foster processes."
"Speaker 4","00;56;04;25","00;56;49;13","So maintain themselves. That is concerned cluster and that is what's the latest version of on the adaptive, not agency, but autonomy. Natural is sometimes not called modulation, but most not of processes, but like something else exists but in between scales and the notion of what is the structures to give. This is pretty complicated. I don't know. I know people that think that level is just an epistemic construct that is built by scientists and this is pretty consistent with a graphical approach."
"Speaker 4","00;56;49;27","00;57;41;13","We have most approach this everything becomes ambiguous. The meaning of every single terms become ambiguous. So I have no idea what would be a correct way to refer to this self precise, what it size that is, that's interested in specific scales of behavior. And it also says implicitly, when we are in the context of inference, that's just not interested in a specific level, but applies for ourselves, applies for some, which applies for societies and which in the case of the arts in France also applies for dust workers flows in whatever so I'm not sure I still have."
"Speaker 4","00;57;41;13","00;58;18;09","I was still, I'm sure what the Russians girlfriend is supposed to do and how it relates to the question of whether states are property communities, because we don't need a proper natural progression of scales until the distinction I think distinction between what is recursive and what is only variance. We only need to state what being cognitive is and to check whether states are and of course what this means for the broader epistemic constructs we've built on this thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;58;18;15","00;58;20;06","Survival blue then Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;58;24;10","00;58;53;09","So I have to go back to back to the French livestream number 31. We talked about how to count biological minds and really this raises so when you're talking about the distinction between adaptive active inference and like mere active inference, and then this theory about how to count biological minds is everything that's biological is do all things then have a mind like even down to like the, you know, single celled organisms."
"Speaker 3","00;58;53;09","00;59;13;18","And in this in this paper, like there are a lot of people who have this like mind life continuity hypothesis us and a lot of people really ascribe to that. So in this adaptive active in France versus more active in France, I couldn't find the line. Like I really pressed on Matt Simmons about this and and he responded beautifully."
"Speaker 3","00;59;13;18","00;59;36;20","Like he also couldn't find the line. So at what scale or what level does adaptive active inference translates into more active inference? And what I'm fundamentally getting at is like, OK, so are you doing near active inference? If you're a single cell and you just move forward and back like towards a replacement or an attractor, like is this mere active inference or is this adaptive also?"
"Speaker 3","00;59;36;27","00;59;59;18","And so like adaptation to the knees. But like to me I think that happens at all levels. But there was this distinction made in that paper that like adaptive active inference happens when the collective forms, some like emergent behavior that makes it more fitted to the niche environment. And so like where is the state then a biological mind?"
"Speaker 3","01;00;00;02","01;00;18;15","Does the state make a set of organisms like more fitted to its knees through this like collective adaptive behavior? Or is it maybe maladaptive? Because overall, like as a species, the more divides we have, like the more war we'll have. I don't know."
"Speaker 1","01;00;21;01","01;00;21;27","Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 5","01;00;24;15","01;00;59;07","Yeah. Thanks for this mesh nets idea. I think that's that's definitely true. And this kind of fits in with the kind of meshed architecture. And I wonder if like Blue was mentioned about this different scales of active inference act identity is quite important here. And the nation state is a kind of is maybe identity driven. And I kind of wonder if we scale that down."
"Speaker 5","01;00;59;07","01;01;25;21","I was thinking scale down. I was talking about the face there early. But for instance, the baby in the womb, OK, is the release during childbirth of the hormones which triggers the woman to break her. Water's basically like a broadcast from the identity of the womb that OK body I'm here now. I'm a I'm a child bearing womb."
"Speaker 5","01;01;26;12","01;02;01;02","I'm declaring myself in the same way that maybe the pituitary gland but it does it all the time declares itself that in times to crash out and create insulin. So could we see that then this meshed architecture comes at a scale where it's possible once the, you know, and then it's like and in the same way, then the nation state, maybe as we go up in scale, the expression of signifiers to broadcast out becomes greater and greater, you know, becomes a bigger and bigger part of it."
"Speaker 5","01;02;01;02","01;02;09;08","And maybe that biological processes become less a part of it."
"Speaker 1","01;02;11;22","01;02;31;22","But definitely it's the question of realism and instrumental ism, whether it quote, is a broadcast or whether we'll just choose to model it as so one of those is definitely safe territory, and the other one is a little bit harder to make claims about what the territory is versus the map that we choose to draw around the territory."
"Speaker 1","01;02;33;00","01;02;39;28","But very interesting points then you OK?"
"Speaker 2","01;02;40;00","01;03;08;20","And one, I just want to make sure that our I'll get feedback from people on this. So to me, adaptation OK, adaptation around what is which can be scale free or if we're talking about active inference, do we also include the counterfactual? What if? And I think if we include the what if, then I'm not sure that adaptation looks the same."
"Speaker 2","01;03;09;09","01;03;31;04","It's not reflective. So I'm not pushing back on survival as much as I'm asking, are we are we overfit are we saying that recursion doesn't matter and are we saying that scale friendly doesn't matter because we only want to concentrate on what is That's my question."
"Speaker 1","01;03;31;20","01;04;12;22","Dean. I'll give a thought then Steven, and then anyone else active inference agents that are capable of doing adaptive active inference as a title. So just a recently proposed word as survival brought up their internal generative model includes a model of perception and action as well as of cognition. So that's meta cognition. The what is of metacognition at one level can be a what if, at another level what is is the agent can actually be imagining a counterfactual with respect to perception and action."
"Speaker 1","01;04;13;04","01;04;47;17","So cognition is that friendly scale. It helps us bridge the what if and the what is, because there's all there's so many other angles, one other path to walk through that would be like in a Neil Seth book being you, there's a great discussion about how counterfactuals actually are like the basis of cognition, like how do we know that we're looking at a real mouse like on the computer table versus like a picture of one at the same resolution because actually there is an implicit counterfactual."
"Speaker 1","01;04;47;17","01;05;12;14","I could move at a different angle and see something different, the physical object, but I wouldn't expect the shadows to move on this JPEG. And so actually the difference in our perception between two things that visually can look identical relates to deep situational awareness that actually blur or at least re-imagine the relationship between what is and what if."
"Speaker 1","01;05;13;11","01;05;16;10","Stephen and then Blue Thanks."
"Speaker 5","01;05;16;26","01;05;59;05","Actually, this paper is serving as quite a useful bridging provocation because as you just mentioned, there, Daniel, with OK, so what if a way of what if and counterfactuals. So there's there's the cognition, which is a particular scale of perspective or or even implicit. What if the counterfactual but what if this and that happens in the future? Well, the other question is what happened by becoming and actually if we want to look at scale free, if active inference is based on free energy principles and free energy principle was pretty much the only form of nonlinear dynamical system out there."
"Speaker 5","01;05;59;05","01;06;30;20","But now we've got some of the stochastic is the classic chaos work and also like if you go right back to nonlinear dynamical systems and a lot of discussion around nonlinear dynamical systems, it were talking about thinking about that as a process of becoming so out to gives you a way what dimensionality you can use, what the process of becoming starts to tie into that and cognition as we see it, doesn't it?"
"Speaker 5","01;06;30;25","01;06;53;23","Maybe the process of being is more a process of becoming but the process of what I broadcast using that term very crudely, what I what my identity conveys is a much more steady much more of an artifactual state, if that makes sense, especially if I take a photo of it and put it up on my profile on Facebook."
"Speaker 1","01;06;55;22","01;07;22;05","Thank you. Here's an article on being and becoming and that distinction as well as I'm sure a panoply of German words has been discussed for a long time about the relationship between being and becoming. And just to give one thought before blue, that generative model of the active agents includes what kind of agent am I, what are my expectations, preferences, affordances, et cetera."
"Speaker 1","01;07;22;16","01;07;53;12","So we get in the deep active inference framework built in what if and then what? And then who would I be and how others see me and what would they think if I were to do this and then this were to change? That's all part of the state space of what's possible. These are like the grammar in terms of the very austere outline of perception, cognition, action and external dynamics that allow composition and new design motifs for those kinds of questions to be asked."
"Speaker 3","01;07;53;28","01;08;20;19","Blue So if you wouldn't mind flipping back to the trusty slide, I think it's 33, and when you're thinking about like, are we talking about what is, or are we also including the what ifs in the model, like when we talk about what it's like to build a state. So, so this is like how states have been built before, but, but how can we like take this?"
"Speaker 3","01;08;20;19","01;08;57;13","And like as Daniel was referring to at the beginning of the talk, like how can we take the what has been and incorporate like what if via active inference to predict like how to optimally, optimally form states in the future. So is active inference incorporating the counterfactuals? Are we going into what ifs or like what about what's next like not just what if, but but what's next to predict like the cognition essentially of a state and how it's, it's going to going to think going forward great question."
"Speaker 1","01;08;57;13","01;09;06;24","And what's next? We can have our expectations. We can have our preferences. They can interact in a different way. So Dean then Eddie."
"Speaker 2","01;09;08;26","01;09;36;13","Now Blue I think that ties in with the point too is that we're we tend to do all I would all I would all I would add to what's been said is that if if we're looking at as as is we're looking at this reflection and and can we ask off of that of what are we becoming of becoming which is a function sometimes of scale, many times of variation."
"Speaker 2","01;09;37;00","01;10;07;20","So I know I keep beating this horse because I want to include the variation and the fact that time changes our picture. That's that's all I want included in this. And I don't think that that as is a perfect copy as we update. So I maybe I'm maybe I'm explaining this wrong, but I think as change occurs, that perfect reflection, that perfect copy doesn't move forward."
"Speaker 2","01;10;07;20","01;10;16;25","Without variation concentration. Sometimes sometimes we just toss it out the window and that's the what if."
"Speaker 1","01;10;17;08","01;10;20;16","Sorry. Thank you, Dean. And then I'll give a thought on that as change occurs."
"Speaker 4","01;10;22;12","01;10;50;26","So in my travels, I've run across this idea that somebody tried to quantify functions of a state that are universal. Right? What are the things like how to how do you maintain health care? Not necessarily which way it's better, but distribution of resources, education, health care, things that we associate with the state. Maybe not every one of them, every state exists or every nation exists, or let's stick with state."
"Speaker 4","01;10;51;06","01;11;11;27","Maybe not every state does. Every one of them, certainly not all of them do it to the same degree of competency. And they are all bound within the expectations of the people who comprise that that polity or that that entity. But to get after your question, blue, if we want to get to what if, how is this different, how two states formed differently?"
"Speaker 4","01;11;11;27","01;11;35;13","What is the optimal thing that I think you've got to get down to like a core set of variables for which states are supposed to provide solutions to or address and then from there we can see, well, what if they did it this way? What if a state prioritized this and not that? What if a state prioritized this function over that function?"
"Speaker 4","01;11;35;13","01;11;59;14","And why would they what did they respond to do? I don't think that they're responding to necessarily uniquely physical or material requirements. I think there's some interplay between intellectual or values based requirements as well as material requirements all mixed up in time and space. Given which parts of history would choose to preference in a particular moment."
"Speaker 1","01;12;00;26","01;12;51;20","Thank you. So one note on that as change occurs. So here's a very influential book with a broad follow up lineage on the geometry of biological time by Winfrey. And it brings us back to the discussion of Kairos and how change occurring in Cronos. We become like pro crusties we have to stretch and pull and change the sequence of action to fit onto the scale as defined whereas thinking about the space of action the geometry of biological time is defined more by action like embryo logical events, rather than how many seconds have ticked on some atomic clock in some bunker."
"Speaker 1","01;12;52;04","01;13;15;11","So that as change occurs, can be through time, but it may not be the kind of time that gets ticked out on a clock. And that's just a very different way to talk about actions and inference because it's dynamic, but it's not just like, OK, the clock's running and things are changing, and it's like there's actually a timeliness to action."
"Speaker 1","01;13;15;19","01;13;32;04","And so we're talking about the dynamics of the context and the timeliness and then maybe there's ways to map Cronos and Cross, or maybe one time we play more into one or the other. So Dean and then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;13;32;04","01;13;53;01","Just real quick. Thank you, Andy, because I think what you did is you applied a partition to preferences and priority and you made sure that we didn't say that they were one in the same so in real time, we see we see an evolution throughout the discourse. So I think that's that's a real example of what kind of happens as we update."
"Speaker 1","01;13;55;18","01;14;19;04","So one other random thought just from earlier and then of course, anyone just bring up a thought or anyone in the live chat. So we were talking earlier about like capital withdrawal and capital with a L. OK, so this was pretty interesting. Capital with a L comes from capitalism, the name of the Temple of Jupiter at Rome on the capital in hell."
"Speaker 1","01;14;19;27","01;14;49;15","So dating in English from the 14th century. So that is referring to like this building that's like very much like city on a hill and city on a hill is used as a multi scale allusion to the United States at the very least like Capitol Hill. But of course broader notions of what the state stands for. And then there's capital with Al Capital on the other hand, has a far wider range of meanings."
"Speaker 1","01;14;49;15","01;15;31;07","An application, the word comes from Latin as well, from caput, meaning head and then it has a lot of policy misuses like capital punishment, which we talked of being the seat of government like Sacramento is the capital of California, but then like venture capital capitalization and so that's just interesting. I hope it's not simple wordplay when there's a homonym, but it's very interesting that they both draw back to Rome, which was alluded to earlier when thinking about the seeds of what today's states are on the world stage."
"Speaker 1","01;15;31;21","01;15;36;27","So Andy, then Stephen Yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;15;37;09","01;16;16;05","So what institutions of the state, right? Like Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be considered an example of embodied intelligence in the context of cognition for the state yes. Something that you said earlier is that people proposed collective agency to be based on the capacity of the certain kind of regime of behavior to influence individual fitness. What I would say is that this is wrong to the logical organization."
"Speaker 4","01;16;16;05","01;16;46;16","It is by definition organization, but it is constraints that exist upon the collective behavior of a system. If you look at states, it's still mean, it is sector. It is something that affects how the still being interacts with the world. And this is something that is entirely invisible from the perspective of a single pursuit of a state, which is the natural level, though a scale perspective you can articulate."
"Speaker 4","01;16;47;09","01;17;25;02","So the view that our organization is entitled by things that affect the needs of their constituents is flawed. What we zation is, is constraint. It's a specific scale on specific behavior, on a specific direction and the relation it does with a body. The body which sort of sounds kind of, of cognition is about is the sense of those constraints that collectively enacts behavior that we say is cognitive."
"Speaker 4","01;17;25;21","01;18;13;21","So when mystery or foreign affairs or something is doing a thing, it is embodied in the sense that it participates in a greater network of constraints which collectively victimization, which entails the behavior, the specific, specific decision of the nature of foreign policy. So for example, if there is some kind of collective panic, moral punishments, communism is likely in the absence of any formal statements against communism that decision be tainted by the best against specific people and words and things that happen in Communist."
"Speaker 4","01;18;14;18","01;18;53;11","And this is not entailed by anything at a level at the level of symbolic preparation that could be construed as considering the highest or most recognizable forms of cognition. Yet this participates in a collective behavior that is adapted from the body of a system systematically. The nation states distinction from earlier, the aggregate behavior of specific sets of decision constraints as processes will build the story processes and physical intent and behavior."
"Speaker 4","01;18;53;11","01;19;23;29","And this is not something that needs to be isolated from any higher level. And this yet is cognition. And this graph is a view of cognition as something that follows states as something that is grounded in not the body of any single individual, but in the body of the state as the set of its consistent constraints."
"Speaker 1","01;19;25;18","01;19;55;24","Thanks. Survival. I also put up a quote that people can pause the video and read from the Gulag Archipelago that specifically refers to organizations as organs of the state, which is a little bit of a almost sinister meat grinder way to describe the state, and it refers to this interplay between the awareness and the actions of individuals and the system's outcomes at the state level."
"Speaker 5","01;19;56;10","01;20;24;24","Stephen Yeah, I think as well as this, this is really useful. I think this embodiment and our intuitive ability to embody does then recapitulate the inference process. So as well as these terms, the seeds of government or whatever coming from, say we see it coming from Roman literature, but over time it's been encoded in encoded and maybe abstracted out."
"Speaker 5","01;20;24;24","01;20;49;08","And we use words and sometimes you have to look up the etymology to sort of find out where they came from. But we, we do intuitively see a difference if someone says someone is going to take their seat at the Senate where you get a feel for that, but you don't say they're going to take their seats at the palace, they're going to take there, they're going to they're going to sit in the throne room because the whole point of the palace is that those seats are not everyday seats."
"Speaker 5","01;20;49;08","01;21;10;06","Right. So there's there's a but you get that because of how, you know, space is treated around one of those seats. Like you don't you don't put a lot of the seats around and roll up a lot of thrones. You give space to it. And there's actually a lot of interesting work in physical theater where you literally can work with space to convey how much space you give."
"Speaker 5","01;21;10;06","01;21;13;05","Someone will convey how much power they have."
"Speaker 1","01;21;14;11","01;21;58;11","That reminds me of the term metronome. So that's like when you say there were ten mouths to feed, it's referring to a system by referring to the sub part of the system. So it's kind of like macro topology. It's about the parts and holes and mythology. And so the mechanism is when revealed through our language we say there were two seats on that committee and the fluidity at which that is semantically unpack it shows that there is a relationship, like when you say there was 20 mouths, you think there was 20 people, and that includes a lot of our assumptions you know, ten pairs of hands or, you know, ten hands."
"Speaker 1","01;21;59;02","01;22;12;04","What does that say about our assumptions about, you know, ableism or about what the default is in our way of speaking like that? Stephen than anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;22;13;16","01;22;50;18","And what able is indefinitely comes in and as these sub these codes as people start to look at Ebola's and that's a very good point and also there's that intuitive understanding that, you know this there's the idea that a team generally is really more between five and ten people to optimally be a team and then you get this idea of a group so you have an intuit when you hit 20 you've gone past a small group into a large group and there's a lot of work around large group interventions and getting aspects of the system in the room, which is about when you can no longer look at each person in the eye and hold"
"Speaker 5","01;22;50;18","01;23;16;17","it, which is sort of after 15, 16 people. So again, you hit this to some extent. We don't need to be told that these things evoke the reality for us as this structured organism in space in place. Now it's probably different for a dog on four legs. Maybe they can only sniff around for dogs, right? And that's a big crowd for them."
"Speaker 5","01;23;16;27","01;23;24;26","So, you know. And is that about their mind or is that about the their morphology? Those is definitely an interesting question."
"Speaker 1","01;23;26;22","01;23;29;03","Thank you. Survival and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","01;23;34;05","01;24;01;08","I like the way you talk of the throne as something that was functionally communicated through medically embodied um, it was because the cognitive activity of the state is very constraints that are not human, but those constraints means to somehow affect the behavior of humans because those factors foster the right mix are basically the dynamics of a human individual."
"Speaker 4","01;24;01;23","01;24;36;21","They need ways to constrain it and influence it to exist as constraints and a major way they do so is by building the niche humans living. So building the way humans embody the assumptions relate to each other, to each other, decisions. It starts to develop and to simply build monumental architecture, to convey that specific buildings of specific functions and are very important."
"Speaker 4","01;24;36;26","01;25;04;08","And that you have to understand the and the underlying philosophy to exist as a potential member of society. It's a way to do so. And that's a way which the throne basically effects people to believe in the kind of exceptional qualities of the suffering which are necessary for states that are suffering to exist."
"Speaker 1","01;25;06;20","01;26;03;19","So the throne and the crown are or any other kind of token there. So it's, it's embodied. It refers to a wearable or a bodily position. It refers to, of course, in a cultured and a semiotic context. It's enacted that relates to declarative speech acts. I pronounce you married. The Speech Act is the the action. And so when we're talking about writing and language driven systems, which is a key part of, again, that that deep histories section, declarative speech acts become very important when you're served the subpoena or when something is rule, then the hammer comes down on the table with sort of like the finality of the act, like an ornament appear relative to"
"Speaker 1","01;26;03;19","01;26;40;03","the declaration that was uttered in a certain ritualized context. These are great examples about how we can use like the four E framework. And also it's going to say it's extended because the crown and the throne, they're literally off of the body. And then what's the story that's like the total like, oh, King owned Emperor's New Clothes wear the extended cognitive apparatus that signals the cultural position of the king is revealed to be not what it is."
"Speaker 1","01;26;40;28","01;27;19;22","And so it's like to strip the person of their role. It's just like stripping off their clothes. And these are just all kinds of very accessible phenomena that we can ask, how does this support A for E or an active inference approach? Relative to some other approach like signal processing? Yeah, I'm sure you can make the neural network that recognizes a crown versus other images but that is like a subcomponent of visual perception within this broader picture."
"Speaker 1","01;27;20;09","01;27;40;16","And then also it helps us ask what if and how we could design embodied and cultured, enacted, extended, et cetera, systems that reflect the statistical regularities of who we are now and how we think things are and how we expect and prefer things to change."
"Speaker 5","01;27;48;19","01;28;12;13","So that's good thing. Yeah, I think that's a very good point. And maybe this is where, you know, the survey was talking about constraints there. And also I suppose it comes back to the idea of when to stop and tune. I talked about this a little bit with Dean is yesterday's and when do we know when to stop is one of the big challenges about, you know, ecological contexts."
"Speaker 5","01;28;12;29","01;28;33;00","And I keep thinking so, you know, you have the hammer comes down, you know, if you have a state, you know, the hammer comes down it, you viscerally have an embodied understanding of what's being communicated by that. You know, that comes down. Something's been hammered out. And in the Houses of Parliament in the UK, they have this big mace."
"Speaker 5","01;28;33;00","01;29;00;22","They call it the mace. It's an ornament, a ornamental mace because a mace. Well, I don't know if this is exactly true. I think the mace normally is something you club someone to the head with in a battle. Right? So it's there is maybe that that big stick idea that's been brought in. But why? One thing that really came to mind when I mean this is coming up was what happened during Nazi Germany when the new technology of sound systems came out."
"Speaker 5","01;29;00;22","01;29;21;23","So the big thing that happened was these big rallies that completely overwhelmed people is no one that had just like we didn't have social media before, no one had had an embodied experience to calibrate. And in some ways you maybe never can because it becomes slightly beyond the concepts of embodiment, what it meant to be in this big arena where you had sound coming from everywhere."
"Speaker 5","01;29;22;08","01;29;51;16","And then the idea is that that was part of the reason why it became disruptive. Maybe we weren't able to constrain and it just became over a cancerous almost overwhelm. But there's something about new technologies and the ability to constrain and find a state that is to some extent sustainable and when it becomes out of control. And is there something about the embodiment that Daniel was talking about?"
"Speaker 1","01;29;51;16","01;29;56;27","There thank you, Steven. Survival and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","01;29;59;16","01;30;45;25","So I want to emphasize that I was in their family sometimes to cling on to the notion of constraint is not something until the notion of an introduction of an order or of of a stop on the behavior of constraint is so process that underlies the coordinates of fast process. For example, if we agree on the sound of some word, say lamp, uh, so we have a relatively slow process that sees our couple behavior that will constrain our right to foster processes in the sense that when one of us use the word line the other when it stands, what's it refers to?"
"Speaker 4","01;30;45;25","01;31;27;17","So it will basically an hour of dimensionality of the possible behavior I have because I will only pick behavior that are consistent with the fact that you said I would learn as I understand it, so the way that we culturally build our own issues, it's not something we understand as constraining, it's something we understand as creative, and that it corresponds potentially to the, the concept of constraint as it would be used by a physicist or some biologist, which is the sense I use in that paper."
"Speaker 5","01;31;30;07","01;31;30;21","Thinks."
"Speaker 1","01;31;32;05","01;31;38;01","It reminds me of a paper I could find it with. Like it was like developmental constraints or."
"Speaker 4","01;31;38;01","01;31;38;25","Opportunities."
"Speaker 1","01;31;39;24","01;32;03;27","And it was just saying, you can think about like, OK, I guess there's some morphological creature that just extends in a blob. But any other one that has facilitated, enabled affordances to grow in one direction can be framed as the constraints from the other dimension. And so there are two sides of the coin to talk about what is the constraint that enables."
"Speaker 1","01;32;04;04","01;32;14;29","It's like chess. It's the enabling constraints on chess moves that allow brilliant chess games in a culture to actually arise. So survival of the direct response then, Stephen, a book."
"Speaker 4","01;32;16;10","01;32;43;06","That I think I think blew the other hand first time. Not sure sure that's what I meant to say is that's true of something that exists as a meaningful construct, interesting behavior. You need social directions, for example, you need Pascal of gas to not be in balance. The default assumption for physicists is that nothing everything depends on nothing."
"Speaker 4","01;32;43;16","01;33;26;10","It's evolved in the bank century. So this means that I need basically for men and the variance of their individual territories to to have all of the necessary information in my system. This correspond to like pressure into putting on the trajectories well, this there is no clear up any to whatever. But if I somehow forbid if I somehow build a collection between the behavior of the special codes, then there are new parts about the heads of emerge."
"Speaker 4","01;33;26;20","01;33;56;15","You have new possible elements of this subspace that exist. You are the creation as far as physicists that is concerned with behavior within certain suspects. This is as far as a goodbye phrase, but the physicists question because we are things that we're not part of. The search base he drew at the beginning of the system but become an existence, something that was nothing but now is."
"Speaker 4","01;33;57;21","01;34;26;05","And what's interesting is this process of becoming as I don't know who as we discussed earlier, because you have kinds of symmetries building and symmetry is breaking. That's all constructive. And yet they need to be constrained because if everything just arbitrarily adopts any kind of behavior in the space that is accessible, that is possible in principle, you have just a philanthropy of what knows."
"Speaker 4","01;34;26;15","01;35;00;04","You are literally nothing to you have just press that whether the facts of existence that we have Hanks talk about, it contains the constraining of the possible space to everything is equally likely to. Some of the things are more likely and it contains a meaningful map between the possible states of the macro level at the lowest possible level of the future."
"Speaker 4","01;35;00;11","01;35;13;24","And the states as we are interested in in specific to specific moments. So thank you. Was the writing on the way that constraints are not restrictive of creative?"
"Speaker 1","01;35;15;03","01;35;36;05","Thank you. The absence of restraints, statistically constraints would just refer to, you know, an unconnected Bayesian graph, just independently vibrating variables. And so to have anything that's tracking or anticipating something else we're discussing the imposition of constraints using that term. Steven And then."
"Speaker 5","01;35;39;04","01;36;18;24","You mentioned I and you, you put that enabling systems slash constraint. So I think there is that I totally get and I think it's a very good point about you know, you've got the statistics stochastic chaos and you've got the general dynamical processes and this is going to be somewhat of constrain in that two different levels. There's also then, you know, if we take consciousness as being the brain, the brain stem and not in the frontal cortex, you know, and it's then sending stuff out, you know, I can see that biological dynamic, but you also have this enabling system of process of scale."
"Speaker 5","01;36;19;06","01;36;50;01","I suppose that in a way I was just referring to and these things can start to be like the ball rolling down the hill, so to speak, you know, it starts to accumulate its own because it doesn't need to extract information to make inferences to make things happen. It's just happening through thermodynamics and dynamics. So I wonder how we can think about the challenge of these macro systems."
"Speaker 5","01;36;50;01","01;36;57;18","Then the enabling system overriding the emergent dynamical system."
"Speaker 1","01;36;59;09","01;37;00;23","Thank you, Andy."
"Speaker 4","01;37;05;03","01;37;15;20","Is there a fundamental difference between thinking like a state and thinking like a tribe, or is it just a level of sophistication with what specialties are enabled, what you get a state level?"
"Speaker 1","01;37;17;06","01;37;17;27","Thanks for the question."
"Speaker 4","01;37;17;27","01;37;58;22","Sort of states are state sponsored incentive systems a tribe does not so like view of a lot of ways societies can be organized that are somewhat in a continuum are what I call a state is a specific control system that well is in a participatory state. Either it exists or it does not. And in the case of tribes, I don't think most of what we call tribe of integrated decision system more like a shared ethnic cultural nodes."
"Speaker 4","01;37;59;28","01;38;06;01","And if they are into Western systems, it's certainly nothing like a organization."
"Speaker 1","01;38;07;29","01;38;55;12","It's so fascinating because the tribe can be implicitly existing without a state as sort of all just noted. And it makes me think about web three and dhows, where it's almost like the states are being defined first and the people are rushing in to fill. So instead of the historical emergence of specialization and elaboration and formalization on top of an implicit background of the people and then in a complex interplay as we've been discussing, this is almost like a computational state that people are migrating to with a preset governance system, sometimes one that's incredibly constraining, and people may not even know how constraining until they're there."
"Speaker 1","01;38;55;28","01;39;12;17","So that's an inversion of how we've seen the members of the state and the states evolution engage so the more things change, the more they stay the same. But it's a different river for sure. So Dean Blue, Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;39;14;28","01;39;41;05","I think I found something that I can I can say I can agree with with that survival and and maybe some of the people who really like genetics because I, I think constraint really matters. And I, and I think the idea that ratio is not in, in typical drift through neutral mutations, even though mutations are a ratio of the non mutations."
"Speaker 2","01;39;41;19","01;40;06;05","I also think that ratios and randomness accommodations are not the same thing. So I think constraint allows us to be able to see the difference between those two things. One is when a triangle is a triangle and the other is when a variation plays upon a variation. And I think we can accept both. That's where I think the constraint piece actually helps us pull the two things together."
"Speaker 1","01;40;07;23","01;40;09;25","Thank you, Dean Blue then, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","01;40;11;15","01;40;36;07","So just to kind of go back to what Andy was saying about the difference between a tribe and a state, but also like when do we know when to stop and processes that constrain? And when I think about this like bidirectional information flow, like if the emergent energy is too strong like then it's out of control, right? There's no constraint."
"Speaker 3","01;40;36;18","01;40;53;19","But but like when the constraint is too strong, like I think about like, you know, even in mental action, the idea that like you have your grip is too tight and so like what whatever you're trying to control, like pops out of your grip, right? Like so like you can squeeze a balloon and then boom. And so there has to be like some balance."
"Speaker 3","01;40;53;19","01;41;20;23","And I just wonder if that balance is like quantifiable, like does downward information have to equal upward information flow? Like, is there like a balance between those two things that allows like a self emergent or not as a self-organizing entity to maintain in the state of an attractor because if like the information flow is too much in one way or the other, the balance goes off and it'll steer away from that attractor space."
"Speaker 1","01;41;22;02","01;41;26;21","Stephen And then I'll add a comment on that blue yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;41;26;21","01;41;52;12","I think that there's the ability to constrain is is going to be at different levels in the States. I mean, you've got certain things which are just like constitutional. We here that's in the States there's constitutional rights, right? They're fixed, they can't change. It's been there for 200 years or whatever. And then you've got more negotiation and in the UK you've got the government has to go and talk to the Queen every couple of weeks or every week."
"Speaker 5","01;41;52;20","01;42;19;14","So in theory, the Queen could constrain now again, they don't just have to send a letter, they have to go and meet in person and talk. That's to be so then there's this into subjective dynamical constraint and then of course then for scale and you've got the kind of we can't really do it as organisms. So we put in an electoral system, but the electoral system and the democracy in North America comes a lot from the tribe."
"Speaker 5","01;42;19;15","01;42;40;22","The, the sort of scale tribes of North America as much as it does from France, is quite interesting. And one thing they have in Toronto, we have the treaty of the dishes, one spoon and the treated dish. One spoon is basically they sat around in a circle. They have a spoon, they have a dish with one spoon. And you only take enough for yourself and you leave enough for nature and is passed round."
"Speaker 5","01;42;40;22","01;43;05;26","And that's the treaty of how to look after the Great Lakes and actually it was a lot of that kind of slightly scaled version of tribal work, which then informs and said, OK, Europe killing each other all the time. What about something a little bit more like this? So actually, democracy in the US is partly from the youth, not really tribes anymore, but that kind of scale piece."
"Speaker 5","01;43;06;04","01;43;21;29","So I think there's, there's, there's, there's that need to draw back into something which is more contextual or more dynamic cool as well as the kind of, I don't know, the more kind of law based approach."
"Speaker 1","01;43;23;07","01;43;45;21","Thank you. So people have been mentioning the getting a grip, which was of course from the paper about how states get a grip on their subjects and that was drawn from the work of of yellow and it felt talking about optimal grip and skilled performance and all these other cool and active and ecological psychological ideas we've talked to."
"Speaker 1","01;43;46;01","01;44;23;23","So it's like of all the trajectories that the golf club can take, we're constraining that to some lower dimensional manifold that's getting a grip. And I totally agree. I think a good example of an empirical system and about what kind of reciprocal interactions exist and what attractor states does that beget is the federalist anti-federalist discussion at the end of the 1700s in the United States with people saying if you have the affordance for a standing army at the federal scale, then we'll see this happen at the lower state level."
"Speaker 1","01;44;24;00","01;45;03;16","Or if there's the ability to engage in foreign diplomacy or print debt at the federal level, then we'll see this happen or not at the state level. And so I think that's where we go from sort of the what has been and what is to the future that we don't know about the what if where we are in that scale friendly level where we're talking about designing or modifying or preserving or intervening in those causal threads that do link and co constrain the smaller subunits with the larger processes."
"Speaker 1","01;45;04;03","01;45;45;11","And how do we talk about the space of design there and integrate our preferences and expectations together with just sometimes the dazzling and tragic and complex history of just everything we see on this map so we'll have just a few minutes left. That's from anyone who would like to. But just here, like some last thoughts, what's something cool from today or what's something that you're looking forward to discussing more next week and otherwise?"
"Speaker 1","01;45;45;11","01;45;50;06","It's been an awesome one. So Stephen and then we'll go around to anyone else."
"Speaker 5","01;45;53;11","01;46;29;08","You know, following on what you were saying that Daniel and I'll use this to sum up it slightly opens up a new thing, which maybe we'll get to the next session. But, you know, how do we see what happens with the nature of tech companies and the huge affordances that that puts into our landscape and also the constraints if we take the McLuhan tetrad of how it then changes the way we behave overall, they're introducing rather than a constraint in or a sort of a wise constraining way is putting out there what's out there."
"Speaker 5","01;46;29;08","01;47;03;00","And it's, it's affording huge amounts of new novel interactions, be it Microsoft, be Google will be Facebook and then Vega and hugely how cool just through permeation into society. So you know it's it's interesting is then where this you know I think that may reflect one of the challenges we have at the moment with corporations getting so big and so thank you and this is a very very good talk and lots of things are sparking off it's I appreciate it thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;47;03;00","01;47;34;23","Yeah like nation states used to be like states where the big players in town those big ones and there were smaller ones but that was sort of like the ultimate level of analysis. Web two we saw websites, stock tickers, Apple, Amazon, et cetera, become bigger than many states and intertwined and among them in a way that sometimes is even more advantageous though they don't have citizenships themselves, they have user identifier hours, they have revenue flows, they have governance models."
"Speaker 1","01;47;35;08","01;48;07;28","And then now into Web three, we go and platforms and protocols, maybe even decentralized ways of accumulating governance and economic systems that will also be at least initially larger than smaller nation states and web to tech companies. So there's going to be like legacy like web zero, one, two, three, four, all of these systems are going to be on the same territory, but they're going to have different maps."
"Speaker 1","01;48;07;28","01;48;37;29","So they're going to be coordinating very differently but anyone else like to give a closing thought? I think there's a lot of stuff in the dark, too, that we'll be able to, like jump off into like survival next week. I want to hear about where we go next. Like what are your next personal research goals and what are other opportunities for individuals who want to, like learn more or research or apply in this area or under this framework?"
"Speaker 1","01;48;37;29","01;48;39;24","Blue and then anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;48;41;10","01;48;46;22","So just a final thought I'd like to discuss more or maybe get more into like what is the state anticipating."
