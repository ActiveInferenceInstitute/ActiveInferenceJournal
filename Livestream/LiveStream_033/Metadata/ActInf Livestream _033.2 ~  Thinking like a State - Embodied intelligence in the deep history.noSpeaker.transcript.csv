"Unknown","00;00;35;15","00;01;03;11","Hello and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining. It's November 30th 20, 21 and we're in active live stream number 33.2 on thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds. This is the second discussion we've had on this paper and if you're watching a long live definitely ask us questions because it'll help us have a fun feedback and a discussion."
"Unknown","00;01;05;01","00;01;33;07","Welcome to Active Inference Lab. We are participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams it's a new slide."
"Unknown","00;01;33;17","00;02;04;16","The short link is gone. It's been deprecated thanks to the work of many awesome active lab participants and especially Jessica B, we have moved over our live stream past an upcoming database to a coder site. So you can go to this code site or maybe somebody can post the link. And this is an interactive way for you to look at the date video, the title, the number, the guests that were on the stream, the keywords, all the links."
"Unknown","00;02;05;00","00;02;25;24","This is linked up with our knowledge management as well as our people management CRM as they call it. So this is an awesome tool that we're using with Kota and hopefully it improves the find ability and the index ability so that if you're looking for some keyword, you can find all the live streams where we discuss that keyword."
"Unknown","00;02;25;24","00;02;35;09","Or if you have somebody who you like to listen to, then you can find them in the guests or the participants section and you can hear what they had to say about a certain topic at a certain time."
"Unknown","00;02;37;13","00;03;19;00","Today in Active Stream 33.2, we're going to be having our dot to jump off slash speculate onwards and upwards. Discussion on the paper by Oflc would include thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds. So we'll just have fun. We have some topics from last time that we put on a slide for 33.2 that we can talk a little bit through as always, things come up and it'd be great to have anyone's questions in the live chat, otherwise we're just going to be chilling and talking about this cool paper."
"Unknown","00;03;19;19","00;03;38;02","So we will start with introductions and then just take it from there. I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll save my specific excitements or what I'd like to or remembered about the paper for our kind of intro round and I'll pass to Dean."
"Unknown","00;03;40;03","00;04;13;17","I am Dean, I'm Calgary and I'm kind of interested like that and seeing what happens when like our migration from Google to Coda and we and we pick up and move off of some of these representations or some of these ideas what that looks like. And I'll pass it over to Stephen Hello, I'm Stephen. I'm based in Toronto and yeah, I'm interested about the generative business."
"Unknown","00;04;13;17","00;04;39;15","I think this paper starts to create and I've had some good conversations with Dean actually, and we've been chewing over how much this may be opens new doors maybe is a step too far at this stage and well, other doors we might have the we can step into. So it's I think it's an interesting set of mirrors and the alleyways to go into."
"Unknown","00;04;41;09","00;05;31;09","So I'm curious what those doors are, which ones have ramps, which ones are downhill, which ones are a spiral staircase? Like what places would one go from this paper? And I'm sure we can start even writing on our 33.2 slide, like, what are those doors are they ajar or are they locked so Daniel, one of the things in I don't know if this is sense making or just messing with something, but if a city was made up, oftentimes like what we see in some of the empty ashes work and then there were markup blankets all over the place, what might that look like relative to the sort of the the city that I live in"
"Unknown","00;05;31;09","00;05;51;05","or the city that you live in or the city that Steven lives in? In are there ways that we can either dissimilarities and are there real differences between what that sort of makes your world markup blankets would represent as versus their actual representations of actual cities? That's one of my questions."
"Unknown","00;05;54;14","00;06;28;10","So let me kind of unpack that. You're talking about the M.C. Ascher art with the stairs going in different apparent directions and asking whether those portals would reflect intelligently designed transporters or what does that physical or cyber physical city look like? Yeah. And many of these live streams, you've had one image on the slide that has the ants walking around the I forget what that symbol is."
"Unknown","00;06;28;18","00;06;37;15","Yeah. Mobius strip with an answer. The movie a strip. So that would be an example of a real representation that we could generate. But it's not a city. That's my question."
"Unknown","00;06;40;26","00;06;43;04","OK, Stephen, and welcome, Dave."
"Unknown","00;06;45;28","00;07;11;13","Yeah. Is that as it is? I mean, it also takes me thinking about cyclotrons or just simple transect walks, which is what you can do in a participatory engagement with a town or something where literally you transact, you walk through cross-section of the town that you don't want encounter with the way sort of structuring participation. But it's, it's an interesting question you right?"
"Unknown","00;07;12;06","00;07;30;16","So basically start to move through and we go through a path and start to see what's on that route. And it's the same thing. That's the question that goes back to you as to why the doorways. It's like the difference. So where do I find my doorways and stuff squeezing through the doorway or when do I need to again step back and find the unifying principles?"
"Unknown","00;07;30;26","00;08;09;12","And when do I need to go back to accuracy? Complexity, and when do I go in to try and force through the doorway, you know, and active influence is allow me to step back and hold more rather than try and not worried about fitting through the doorway. However, as we realize we're talking here, like at some point you need to put stuff into the communications encoder and Google Docs, you know, so in some ways you're going to categorize for practical, practical purposes, right?"
"Unknown","00;08;09;12","00;08;50;08","But it's not the same as walking on the Mobius Strip. So there's an interesting challenge as practitioners that we face Hmm. OK, welcome back, Dave. I hope it's working. Just everyone remember to, you know, if you're not talking and turn off all your messaging applications, the idea of the transact, that reminds me a lot of ecology where we know that there's spatial and temporal variation but a common approach is to take a transect like either going up an elevation gradients or going within the same elevation gradient."
"Unknown","00;08;50;08","00;09;27;28","So those are kind of like the two directions that we always talk about going on, the rotational component that climbs straight up the hill to see how elevation changes biodiversity or to go at the same altitude maybe on a north to south to ask how does latitude influence biodiversity at a given elevation that's like that ISO contour. So then the transect is a sampling approach that in the context of a generative model gives us a picture of the map of the territory."
"Unknown","00;09;28;11","00;09;55;24","So yeah. Steven. Yeah, that's good. I think it's probably been ported over when whoever did that is probably more used in participate tree development and community development than participatory theater. And so it's like support development might touch on it, but a lot of times of work doesn't really let up when you go there. They just talk about scenes and situations."
"Unknown","00;09;55;24","00;10;27;17","But I think the transit is a nice way to sort of walk through and get a cross section in that kind of semi scientific way. But I actually then was much more interesting than going for social topography and just allowing people to get the whole landscape out there, which in some ways once we get into the kind of agent based work which I didn't know about that, but you know, then the argument would be, well, the transit is already adding all this complication."
"Unknown","00;10;27;17","00;11;08;16","You've got people walking, taking a cross section of the town as opposed to having something nice and clean. So I didn't some we won't go even further, but you my experiences as well it's OK if you regime if attention is being organized around a certain type of act of inference. Right so yeah you don't be doing if you're deducting because you just get completely swallowed it's swallowed up by it so that that could be interesting so cross over that well it's like one way to take the transect and perhaps a Noel transect would be a quote straight line that would just be unbiased."
"Unknown","00;11;08;16","00;11;34;24","It's a simple choice. And then in a city you might want to take that transect or you might be on rails, so you might be taking the f muni in San Francisco and that's like giving you scenes of city life. And that actually speaks to the difference between Kronos and Kairos. Kronos is like that straight line that just doesn't care whether you're putting the meter stick over the city or the mountain."
"Unknown","00;11;35;06","00;12;08;04","And then Kairos is like that streetcar or the path that's like you're walking along the path, but it might have curves, but that's the path that you're on. So then that's more like Kairos. Then yeah. So I don't know whether the author was intending this, but one of the things that I took away from the paper that I thought was really potentially an amazing insight from the paper was the fact that if you go into a city, you can get a sense of a feeling of the city."
"Unknown","00;12;08;04","00;12;48;05","So there is a collective feel you can I'll take my own personal example. You can go into the city of Barcelona and it isn't just where it is situated on a coast there is that fundamental feeling difference. As somebody who is now within that geographic territory, then the one that you you sense when you're in Madrid or when you're in Lisbon, they each each have a collective feel about them and it isn't just that you want it to be different because the architecture is different or where it's where it's situated on a hill is different."
"Unknown","00;12;48;12","00;13;19;18","There's actual social aspects of that feeling which make themselves present and which you attune to. So I don't I would never argue with the fact that as an example of a collective act of inference that cities couldn't exhibit those those types of of not just behavior but sense of, of who we are and what we are, what we are."
"Unknown","00;13;20;14","00;13;45;12","But I'm not sure like again, I'm not sure if it the scale aspect of this actually works because as I said in my mind, I could do the extra thing all the time. I can twist things and invert things, but it's hard to do that with dead things made of concrete. Not I'm not saying it can't happen, but I don't see examples of that out there when things scale up and out."
"Unknown","00;13;46;23","00;13;47;21","Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;13;50;27","00;14;25;24","Yeah. And so as you walk in, if you say walking down these routes in Barcelona, for instance, is you mentioned that you know, this the route that we pass along and that's kind of what's available. And there's a there's a scale that's friendly to being available. There's a certain size of buildings and certain you know, at the end of the day, if you're walking in or you're going through some ambulatory routes, there's this things available to you there's this, but there's also then what's adjacent to that and what's hidden and what's hidden right next to you."
"Unknown","00;14;25;24","00;14;50;27","Maybe there's a homeless person on the site are they on the same route? Are they seen the same things I'm seeing? Are they seeing the same affordances? Are they seeing what's you know, an often that view is where the vantage point is. So whereas with what's behind that wall on the right, what's hidden from the time that we see these buildings."
"Unknown","00;14;52;01","00;15;32;09","And I think that that is that's an interesting question of, you know, this the system as seen from a perspective and then this what it's really like in many different contexts Thanksgiving dinner yeah. Which which brings me to the rather familiar which to me standing beside it sticks out and up and all over the place and has allusions to termite mounds and, and, and, and like it's one of those attempts, I think to actually mimic the things that we eat here."
"Unknown","00;15;32;09","00;16;04;20","And it certainly is the oil and ramping. I mean, it's there if you want an example of where architecture is actually doing a symbolic how do you do this rather familiar would be a perfect example of that in terms of what in terms of what is active in for some of the some of the shapes we see kicking out from some of the math that's happening in the on the in the statistical mechanics."
"Unknown","00;16;04;20","00;16;33;12","So that's kind of fascinating to you know what you mentioned, OK, a few you know little references since we're in the fun dot to there we go viral. So the Tower of Babel weather or whatever it was, it's often at least classically represented as a spiral ascent. Yeah. So that's very interesting that that's it's not like the Tower of Pisa with just rings."
"Unknown","00;16;33;29","00;17;11;16","That's like ISO contours that are separated from each other. But there's something about the way that it's classically shown that makes it look more like it's a spiral, which is, as we've discussed from a technical perspective, related to the decomposition of that spiral into an uphill irritation or component and then a purely rotational component. Then the other sort of reference was to William Blake's poem London, where he says, I wandered through each charted street near where the chartered Thames does flow and mark in every face I meet marks of weakness, marks of woe."
"Unknown","00;17;12;12","00;17;36;26","So here there's so much about how the streets are chartered, the flow of people, and the river is chartered because it's also part of the niche that's been engineered. And there's also flow. Which brings us back to number 32. That was our big lead in was flow. What is flow and how can different systems have similar mappings of heat flow information?"
"Unknown","00;17;36;28","00;18;13;29","Flow, bulk flow, particle flow, liquid flow. So how does flow matter in a city? The sewage going out and the resources coming in? And then also it's like even niche modification on our countenance. It's marked on the faces that Blake is meeting. Aspects of the city are kind of imprinted on them. And then that speaks to what Dean was saying about how there's like a collective feeling that's partially architectural, but it's like a feedback that's complex between the people all the time in the place."
"Unknown","00;18;13;29","00;18;47;06","So Dean then yeah. And it's, it's interesting too, because the art of that's part of this, whether it's a cathedral or, or whatever the artifacts are, they get kicked out. We can look at that from an ingredient standpoint. Like we can look at beer as having water and yeast and barley and, and whatever. Right. But but the fact is there's also time required and there's also energy that has to be applied."
"Unknown","00;18;47;06","00;19;17;10","And I think that's the part the time and the energy piece of city states that are are the real key to whether or not we can see what as individuals, we we perceive act inference as affording versus what on a collective level, we see active inference as affording. I think where it where it separates is on the specifics of the ingredients."
"Unknown","00;19;17;10","00;19;26;05","But where the common is is in terms of the energy applied and the time required Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;19;28;29","00;19;55;22","You know, with the idea of the time and energy, I mean, and we're talking about scale and scope, you know, when you're around the tens I mean, back in the day, there was that big, there was a boat full of important people. I don't say royalty or the politicians or whatever, but they were on the Thames and the boat kind of sank and the people in the water, because the water was so putrid and rank that a lot of them died basically."
"Unknown","00;19;55;27","00;20;20;14","And and that instigated a lot of the cleanup. So I suppose there's this question of like how close is close? You know, like you get closer to the water and at some point you put your head in it, you can't really make anything out of water. You know, then you've got like certain vantage points which allow you to understand that you're in a charter Thames you get so close, you could be in any body of water and then you move out further."
"Unknown","00;20;20;15","00;20;49;09","So there's a there's this there's a scale dependency in terms of how you can structure. You relate to the information and then just, you know, whether you like it, there's a structurally dependent nature of the scale of the Thames, right? So I can't walk across the Thames and it's too small compared to that Wall Street. So these are these are some of the questions in terms of how the information's going to be processed and how much of that information is adjacent to someone, how much is it's hidden?"
"Unknown","00;20;49;26","00;21;08;29","Because those people on that boat, they live next to a smelly Thames for a long time. Actually, the people in the House of Commons have scented handkerchiefs. They got their nose so that they could overcome the smell of the sewage in the Thames. And so you know, at some point they got they got up close and dirty to it."
"Unknown","00;21;09;05","00;21;13;20","And probably change their perception of what was really going on."
"Unknown","00;21;17;05","00;21;49;01","Interesting. So another thing I had written down and kind of connecting us to some of the core terms in active affordance which is the capacity for action and those are the opportunities for policy selection. They're chosen among the different affordances and in cities, it's very related to ability and access to people who are walking down the street are able to enter different doors and they're able to sit down in different places."
"Unknown","00;21;49;01","00;22;22;28","And so I think that's a very tangible and important example of embodied, extended and cultured, et cetera, cognition, all these and other letters, because it's something that we all experience. They're issues that people really care about and putting them under a descriptive, I hesitate to say neutral banner of affordances, financial affordances or physical, or however it may be, it helps us have a discussion about like what the affordances should be."
"Unknown","00;22;23;14","00;22;39;15","Should you be able to get into the bus in the back of the bus? There's trade offs for that. You know, maybe it's harder to clock the fares, but then it might be easier to access for some people. But then now there's this ability for people to evade the fare. But then how bad is that relative to the busses being late?"
"Unknown","00;22;39;15","00;23;30;16","If everybody has to go in the front like all of these kinds of trade offs, act of inference is giving away to talk about the age and tic level, the individual person on the streets of the city and their perception cognition and action, which are selected from their affordances, which are situational, not just like all people can go up a staircase and then we have a individual level model and can ask then, OK, collective model feedback with a niche, and then where adults paper takes it is like the city and the states as active inference agents composed of subunit active inference agents, just like we can have an active model of a body as well"
"Unknown","00;23;30;16","00;24;19;20","as of the cells Stephen Yeah. I'd be curious what your thoughts are on this, Daniel, in terms of when when we have the active inference models like you mentioned, know often, you know, particular low dimensional ways to get into sort of types of user attention. You know, maybe it's the model of the nature of people, you know, looking at this that they're attentional states, X, Y and Z and the coastal, the challenges, once you go and you start walking through different doors and you're in a town and you've got this question about what, how do you model that when when the actual low dimensionality becomes very hard to to work with and I suppose that"
"Unknown","00;24;19;20","00;24;47;18","question then is at what point do you look at what actual people are doing, which hasn't happened as much in active inference, and then try and go back and try and understand, OK, what is what they've done and how that's inscribed on them, each reflective of the action policies and versus how much is it about looking at the sensorium that might explain the generative model that we anticipate going on in emulating that?"
"Unknown","00;24;47;18","00;25;12;25","And so that might relate to I suppose you might have that same question that, you know, when you try and do an agent based model of a few ants and as a conceptual and when you try and understand what answer to in situ, you know, because obviously that gets kind of complex, right? Because they're all moving around. So I don't know that it has a correlation to that question in that field as well."
"Unknown","00;25;12;25","00;25;32;07","But I think that relates here to this situated cityscape scale because it's very granular once you get into that. And in some ways it's nice to make it become like a mind. It's nice to make all of that because suddenly it kind of fits in with the modeling that we kind of use. Right. And in some ways it might."
"Unknown","00;25;32;07","00;26;07;13","So there may be some validity, but it may be that the we have to bring in that mind body environment, dynamic or mess that opens in questions about what how do we go about that good question. So here on this slide, we have the dimensionality of active models. So we can even just emphasize maps, not territories. And then what what does the next step in formalizing this model look like?"
"Unknown","00;26;07;13","00;26;55;20","So let's think of a specific city situation and then we can talk about like modeling that city situation and what would the dimensionality of the model be? Where does regime of attention come into play? So what would be like a city situation? Commons situation, fringe situation, important situation, like what's a case that we care about in a city, maybe one that involves complex interactions between, for example, bureaucracy, which was a main topic of the paper and legacy history and affordances of agents I think to get there you'd have to have a lot more of the bottom up aspect of that being honored as opposed to more of the top down control piece."
"Unknown","00;26;55;29","00;27;33;16","I don't know what the final product would look like because it's act of inference. I would be inferring and I would think that there would be there would be 13 million architects and one citizen which is not how cities are typically designed. And that's one of the struggles that I have with this in terms of drawing, of drawing a parallel across scales because there's only one of B, but I've got however many neurons and I'm kind of dependent on those."
"Unknown","00;27;34;08","00;28;03;22","So OK, yes, I see where you're going. And I think we'll we're going to keep the bottom up and top down. And I think this modeling approach, it's not the only one, but starting with a scenario and kind of like Bruno, the tours actor network theory or aren't appropriately we can start by identifying traces and action trajectories in that scenario."
"Unknown","00;28;04;16","00;28;33;21","And let's see if in a bottom up way on our first pass, we can get to like a skeletal active model and then the iteration is infinite slash perpetual. So I don't think it's about just going for one, getting bottom up input once and then laying the groundwork down and then progress crusties from there on. It's an iterated process and this is how we start from the bottom."
"Unknown","00;28;33;21","00;28;57;19","So we're going to kind of like start from the bottom up of a scenario that's real, that describes subject verb object that people will recognize person gets on bus and then let's think about what active core terms we would want to apply to different nodes, recognizing that even the assignment of internal external blanket states, it's conditional on our model."
"Unknown","00;28;57;26","00;29;31;18","It's not like the door is a blanket state outside of us modeling it a certain way. And certainly we know external and internal are that way as well. Stephen And then this this question of model and of course this is where the nation how much the needs can come in I think one of the things if we're taking more modern societies, I mean certainly more recently is there's been an increasing role of this top down my call literally copy and paste."
"Unknown","00;29;31;18","00;30;01;22","I mean in Canada they've got something called Shopper's Drug Mart. They've got these kind of stores now and having worked in some agencies, graphic agencies is I can just imagine like there's like a design for a store. It gets tweaked and it literally and this couldn't have really happened in the past. It literally gets copied and pasted and it looks like it, you know, it looks like, oh, here's another shop that's another drugstore, but more like a chain, you know, franchise."
"Unknown","00;30;01;22","00;30;24;10","McDonald's is a classic case of suppose there's some of that fashion, but it's pretty much like Plunk, Plunk, and in some ways that's that that now there's an infant is kind of devoid from active inference. And that maybe part of the problem is the more that it's done that way and the less that there's a kind of an even in the top down, there's not really even an inference process going on there anymore."
"Unknown","00;30;24;11","00;31;00;26","It's like, what are we going to do? I'm just going to copy and paste using a machine, something that was done elsewhere, not even contextualized from the top down anymore. It's just we just completely bulldoze whatever we need to make it fit agree that that's the franchise model, which allows for rapid deployment, for example. And then on the other side, from the user's perspective, maybe walking into a franchise is comforting and there is a reduction of uncertainty about I'll seven is where the cereals are up."
"Unknown","00;31;01;05","00;31;33;28","Wow. I was right there actually. They're even though I've never been in this city. And so that is definitely a evolutionarily novel context to have that level of precision of like what you'll find somewhere you've never been. But it allows for an increasingly globally accessible reduction of surprise. And maybe we're seeing that the reduction of uncertainty of what is there and the quality and how many grams are going to be in that box and the profit margins of everybody down the line."
"Unknown","00;31;34;24","00;32;12;12","That system in many cases displaces the, you know, hand shuffling of granola and every little co-op having its own granola blend. And these are definitely scenarios that can be models of active inference. Dave And then Steve. Yeah, the cut and paste mentality for corporate decision making in particular is really destructive of the single biggest determinant for where you're going to locate a new business if you're a corporation, either putting in your own outlets, doing franchises, is there lots of competition?"
"Unknown","00;32;12;17","00;32;41;09","There's lots of competition. That's the location I want so you've got all these outlets competing with each other. When you go across town, there's this whole underserved area where everybody would be happy, including your employees and your stock owners. I've seen this in when a Walmart came into my old town, the one big draw that would send people to the Kmart is Kmart had not changed any of their layouts for decades."
"Unknown","00;32;41;09","00;33;02;29","So all the little old ladies who had trouble remembering where they lived could still find the granola. So what happens when one Wal-Mart opens up across the street? Well, they went in, reorganized Kmart and all. The little old lady says, well, if there's no reason to go to Kmart anymore, I might as well save a few cents at Wal-Mart."
"Unknown","00;33;04;17","00;33;23;01","And and again, on the first pass, it's like it where there's less access to that thing. But you go, Well, I already know people are shopping here, and now I can draw people who are shopping and people who are new. It makes makes dollars. Doesn't make sense. What do they say, Stephen?"
"Unknown","00;33;25;24","00;34;02;19","Yeah, this this question about how to deal with a niche is a massive, massive challenge, you know, because the the bottom up ability to self-organize once that's lost, often you do. You're now in a different regime. You've lost something and it becomes it becomes augmented by these other because it's not even like we say that somewhere we look they don't necessarily look like if I was in a town, I might look where people are shopping."
"Unknown","00;34;03;03","00;34;33;23","But actually what's happened is they're looking at the output of some metrics which tells someone head office the the key performance indicators from which they can algorithmically make some decisions and it all starts to roll out. And one of the things that does mean the initial stages with, say, food, like one reason for say, oh, why would I go to McDonald's?"
"Unknown","00;34;34;26","00;34;56;03","Like, well, at least they think they wash, they don't know it. But by washing everything in ammonia or by basically by things always not having a code, I which is not an incidental thing in some areas. So you go there and it's like it becomes like this will never fall below a certain standards that's what their main thing is."
"Unknown","00;34;56;12","00;35;37;26","We've got buckets and buckets of disinfectant around the back, so you never have to worry about any of the equipment, blah, blah, blah, because the downside of that is that you get into this vicious cycle of mechanization which suits that kind of producer that reminds me a lot of our discussions with Stephen Fox, I think in 27 about industrial engineering and before Dean could even reload, there was the craft dimension and it was about the integration of craft and industry and how just bringing up here's the tolerable limits like that."
"Unknown","00;35;37;26","00;36;06;05","Does it mean that you're going to take it to some extreme over mechanic sized way but balancing those two, I just want to return to a specific scenario, particular scenario in a city that will help us extend and connect to the paper. And then we're going to go through some of the terms and actually just stay with one model and look at what does an active inference model of a city look like?"
"Unknown","00;36;06;19","00;36;37;17","Some people may read Savile's paper and then think, OK, it was prose. I didn't see a figure. I didn't see an equation, I didn't see an example so what are we going to do to actually connect this to my local public transit planner or this grant that we have in this area? Steven, we could use an example helping to connect people, connecting across agent culture and using public spaces and Internet access."
"Unknown","00;36;37;24","00;37;11;23","So using actually the project we're just looking at the moment where we're putting in a wi fi mesh in a community as sort of a newcomer community, relatively low income. So there's questions about, OK, do you do you bring in resources so that people get more stuff at home? And then how much of that stuff at home is enough?"
"Unknown","00;37;12;10","00;37;38;01","To leverage something outside of just in sharing? How does that then leverage doing something with it back in the community, making it something that extends the niche, you know, and things like Meetup. So I think that's a familiar platform, which is be quite useful for people to self-organize. So we see this ability to do that through the Internet."
"Unknown","00;37;38;01","00;38;04;25","But of course the will was the ability to do that in real life as well, like the coffee shops, the cafes, you know, so you know, you know, anyway, yeah, let's pick a we can do like a meet up, you know, planned or unplanned meet up at a certain spot. But let's pick like a very specific scenario where somebody can say, I haven't seen that be modeled this way."
"Unknown","00;38;04;25","00;38;38;25","There are new ways that we can now talk about that scenario. So, Robert, many important areas connecting across ages and cultures, et cetera. So let's think of some public space like we could do, say a cafe, a cafe adjacent to a park. Let's say that and we know that that might be related to other cafes, which we say if there's this cafe next to a park and how does that relate to you know, getting a coffee?"
"Unknown","00;38;38;25","00;39;08;13","But obviously it's not just about getting the coffee, is it, that there's an interest in. Yeah. What does that relate to the niche? So we're going to talk about this. So how does that relate to the niche, the ability to have action policies, the ability to serve service needs? Yes. But also service wants and loves. So actually in actually one thing that you might find an interest in, in, in the in the developed world when they're trying to look at more complex context is you got needs, want and love."
"Unknown","00;39;08;17","00;39;24;28","What would what needs to happen? What would I want to happen, what would I love to happen? And often what would love to happen is actually more generative we often everyone wants to talk up the needs or I need to get a cup of coffee. OK, here you go. I need what she needs now. I need a drink."
"Unknown","00;39;24;28","00;39;49;18","OK, here you go. And it's kind of stuck, right? Well, what do you want? What would you love? And that's kind of what humans have a role in you know, we're not a machine that needs filling in one Avon's. So I wonder how you what your thoughts are in terms of how that so a café should we think of because we've all going to have a different cafe in our minds here let's yeah I agree."
"Unknown","00;39;49;18","00;40;16;27","You know it shouldn't be like the cafe on in my little town on this corner so we're going to talk about a cafe adjacent to the park also. Dave, thanks for the cool sumo references in the live chat. I think that's an example of how you can scaffold and use ontology as a thought pump and explore formal dance towards the formal and then back towards the qualitative so it's a cafe adjacent to a park."
"Unknown","00;40;18;01","00;40;46;26","We're not describing the territory that would be like a Boris horror novella where we're trying to describe to the atomic level, you know, the paint coding on the street light. So dispense, we're doing a human centric model. Maybe there are assistant animals, but we're going to build up the model and that's why we're discussing this on the slide with dimensionality."
"Unknown","00;40;47;22","00;41;17;02","So what's the dimensionality of a cafe next to a park? I mean, the question barely makes sense. You can have a parameter in your state space for every molecule of air, but we're talking about a communicable, simple model that might be on some sort of preda optimal front Bayes optimal front of accuracy and complexity. So it's like I can't explain this to the local politician in a third of a seconds, but 3 minutes is probably too much."
"Unknown","00;41;17;09","00;41;45;23","So we're going to find some communicable level of detail and make a use oriented act in skeleton and then see where that takes us down. So this is a I'm asking this question because I don't really know if we've got a cafe adjacent to a park. Are we having some kind of a are we assuming some kind of a compounded sense around what is an attractor state here?"
"Unknown","00;41;49;08","00;42;13;13","So it's a great question like dwell times, like maybe there's some transition frequency from the cafe, you know, from non locations that we're not even discussing. It's not the whole world. This is our map. It's just a little map into the cafe and then from the park to the cafe and then there's like the ingress and egress of the park and then it's relationship."
"Unknown","00;42;13;13","00;42;39;28","So we could even start to think about like nodes and edges that are connecting the location of a person. Stephen And then we'll start working through the list or feel free to say in. Yeah, I think that's the image I was thinking about. Like the non equilibrium steady state is. So maybe we need to think, OK, you got Cafe Jason, subpart F, OK, so like you say, you could be what's the non equilibrium steady state of that grass if there's grass on the edge of the park, right?"
"Unknown","00;42;39;28","00;43;17;18","OK, what's the non equilibrium steady state for the the behavior section? And actually some really interesting work and that's how we have does with behavior settings so maybe that could be another. So and of course we'd have to see what scales like what sort of scale scales friendly to this kind of question. If, if the behavior setting was just kind of that's kind of an idea of the niche almost as is capitulated by each person."
"Unknown","00;43;18;22","00;43;39;05","And of course this is where the challenge is in terms of if I'm going to be taking the sensory state perspective, I kind of have to take an agent. Yes. There's no sense to outside of a specifically defined agent. So which agent are we going to be looking at? So we take the risk. You want to take the barista."
"Unknown","00;43;39;06","00;44;05;09","That might be easier. Look, let's just do human, OK? So these are people who we're talking about. There's other entities there could be drones flying around for sure. There's ants. There's all kinds of stuff happening in the territory, allegedly. But we're going to be making a reduced dimensionality model, maybe one that has low computational overhead or maybe one that's easy to communicate or one that explains a lot of variance."
"Unknown","00;44;05;09","00;44;32;25","But not every single nook and cranny. So we're going to be talking about humans in the cafe adjacent to the park in a city Dean so if we're looking at this through the lens of act of inference, there's two things now that have been raised. One is, do we have to we have an attractor state and meaning where people migrate, will they move, will they congregate, will they gather?"
"Unknown","00;44;32;25","00;45;02;05","And then Stephen brings up the idea of, OK, so how do people remain in that non equilibrium steady state? How does the expectation now get realized? Once the migration has occurred? This is what an action and act active inference working together allows where something gets kicked out at the end right? Some with some material thing with with ingredients that we can now account for gets kicked out at the end."
"Unknown","00;45;02;05","00;45;27;18","But in the meantime what we have to do is we have to actually look will people gather? Is this actually a place that people will now move towards? And then because that's a city, right? They've all congregated and then we have to ask is will expectations meet intentions? That's what act event that's what going through an active inference process actually affords."
"Unknown","00;45;27;18","00;46;18;14","It doesn't guarantee, as you said, Daniel doesn't guarantee this. The specifics and the particulars of what it does hold up on a more abstract level for a longer period of time before energies actually apply, before something actually materializes and I think that's what gets most people up because there isn't a critical path ready to be fulfilled. It's an act of inference process that has to have certain anchors in the ground before you can before an anchor is meaning abstract that you have to have available that act as affordances, that it eventually kick out the blueprint, which eventually kicks out the dwelling the edifice thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;46;20;28","00;46;46;28","And so you've got this kind of broader dynamic. So again, so resolving scales again. So it comes in because it's like there's going to be the broad level customers and someone serving in the cafe right a Starbucks customer barista. It's a tie in with that vibe. You've got they've got a different tell logical expectation even in the abstract."
"Unknown","00;46;46;28","00;47;12;23","We haven't even worked out who they are right now. Of course, that's not quite so true. If one of the customers is an adult with three year old child or the three year old child's expectations, a slight difference in terms of what it is to go in there. So you've got this, but essentially speaking, there's it's a regime of behavior that each of them are logically attuned to to some extent."
"Unknown","00;47;13;15","00;47;38;24","Look, let's go through these terms in this order and there's a specific reason why. And so affordances are capacities for action. They're what actions are selected from. Yes, they're ecologic or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Which affordances will we put in our model? So taking out a phone of your pocket, it's an award. It's but is that the model that we're making?"
"Unknown","00;47;39;21","00;48;10;26","So again, not the dimensionality of the territory, but what is our model are we interested in treating the person like a blob? And the affordance is literally just go to the park or leave the scene and so we can have a simple matrix. Are you going to be in a three by three matrix? Are you going to be in the cafe, in the park or neither with a transition on the off diagonal and the diagonal would be your dwell time."
"Unknown","00;48;11;20","00;48;40;00","So that is like the person is just like a point OK? Also, affordances can be zoomed in and a lot more granular. The affordances could be the angle of every joints in the person's body and that might be relevant if the steps are going up to the cafe and someone doesn't have a joint mobility to raise up their leg a certain level, then that is going to influence their transition movement matrix."
"Unknown","00;48;40;17","00;49;05;11","So when we call Green to just the blob and the three by three transition matrix, which is simple, that may abstract above important layers. So that's why iterated modeling is really important. But iterating means we need to have something there to iterate on. So for a first past, do we want to do a model of movement of the people among the different spaces?"
"Unknown","00;49;05;23","00;49;36;29","So that would be like one example. Another example would be like, we're interested in drinking behavior. So the affordance that we're going to model is the choice of no drink, coffee, tea, smoothie. So we're making a kind of behavioral economic model and actually we're not as interested in the movement's transitions. We're interested in how vanish the temperature influences people's buying habits."
"Unknown","00;49;37;22","00;49;57;00","Or we could have both. We could have where they are as a blob and what drink they buy or we could have where they are and all their joints and what drink they buy. And then looking at the phone, that's the dimensionality of the model it's not the dimensionality of the territory because we're still talking about the same place."
"Unknown","00;49;57;10","00;50;09;04","So what kind of affordances do we want to focus on? Like we know that you could do anything a person could do is going to be in Affordance, but what affordances are we going to be talking about here?"
"Unknown","00;50;11;08","00;50;42;12","I like the idea of working with the where, the awareness, and I think there's a lot of tendency for what person orders, what the thing is, the sort of thing that you can in some ways potentially emulate in that I don't think you can emulate the way in this in a lab. But so what sort of zones might they occupy like this, this around table there's around the doorway."
"Unknown","00;50;42;19","00;51;10;25","So it could be, you know, you've got these. Yeah, you've got the park. So even more broad. Yeah, it might be a very broad level. There's the cafe, there's the park. And then that can, that can then break down by some zones or maybe they fall out from the model, you know, some yeah. So these, this is going to be fun because I'll just do like so the diagonals of the Matrix, this is like a movement matrix."
"Unknown","00;51;11;06","00;51;36;25","So the stay is the number could be like zero to one. The probability in the next hour or the next minute is not an absolute as claimants time dependents. And then you could imagine within staying at the cafe, we could make another little matrix that had the table, the bathroom, the counter, but it would be only and strictly within that top left."
"Unknown","00;51;36;25","00;52;15;12","So that's the sub matrices that we were looking at in number 32. So we're going to be in a state and that's what course screening means somewhere. Someone can't look at our matrix and say, how could you not have modeled the counter in the bathroom when people have great, we made a three by three matrix, now let's make a sub matrix and let's make that fine grained or that sub matrix could be defined in terms of chronos, like what is your coordinates in the cafe three, comma four, or it could be Kairos they're at the counter or they're doing something spatially, but we're not putting a number on it."
"Unknown","00;52;15;25","00;52;38;17","So staying is the on diagonal because we're making a coarse grained movement model. We're not looking at their elbow angle, we're not looking at where they are inside the park. This is a first iteration of a model. And then if there was surprise coming from our model discrepancies with the observations, just like asked if we could update our model."
"Unknown","00;52;38;24","00;53;00;25","But again, iteration entails that we need a complete model before there's anything to discuss. If people are just throwing out random core terms and terms outside of the active ontology, it's part of a discussion, but we're not iterating on a model, so it's fine. But that's not making an active inference model. Dean And then we'll continue so I like this because materialization piece."
"Unknown","00;53;00;25","00;53;30;26","Now what gets kicked out is on a gradient descent. But but my question again then is so when you're talking about affordance, are you including availability as in what Steven was talking about? Because of where I am now, things are at hand or proximal or are you talking about threshold lowering, meaning ease at which something can be attained because they're not they're not the same thing."
"Unknown","00;53;31;04","00;54;11;25","And I want to know whether or not we're including both in terms of crystallizing this materialization Stephen. And then we'll come to that and this is helpful with like nothing is good, this idea of truly down. And I suppose this is this is this extra question. Maybe it's at the side there, but is how much to does the nature of things change by being in the cafe cafe, you know, open how much?"
"Unknown","00;54;12;23","00;54;40;02","By staying in one location or moving between locations is that question about this kind of I suppose is this kind of fluidity? Right. And that's an interesting side question, which we can we can put it in our model. We can will be able to actually iterate on that question. And I would argue this isn't drilling down. This is building up there's nothing to drill into until we have this fully described."
"Unknown","00;54;40;03","00;55;01;13","Otherwise, it's just like to people are you can't drill into a linear model that hasn't been specified. So there is no drilling down until we're talking about something particular. And then we could coarse grain or we could fine grain or we could iterate or elaborate or transpose. But we're at the zero to one step in active modeling here."
"Unknown","00;55;01;27","00;55;33;18","Dave. Yeah, and making those transitions actually changes the inventory of potential affordances of other participants. When you walk into a room, you give every person in that room seconds to either greet you and establish a potential relationship or to say, Oh, this guy doesn't want to talk to me. Or He would have nodded yeah. Goffman goes into painful detail on how that stuff works."
"Unknown","00;55;34;02","00;56;15;11","The and that one relationship can persist for years. The guy you nod to and the guy you never to, you know it up or down. It's very personalized and cultural, and that's definitely like a level that we we haven't even gotten into the entire agent IC but we can we'll, we'll get there and we can see is this part of our zero to one model or is that going to be included in our one to two model but repeatedly returning to not not you know, saying about thing but just repeatedly returning to aspects of the territory before we have a model to iterate on, the model is going to remain uncompleted."
"Unknown","00;56;16;14","00;56;50;04","And you'll have done a partial inventory of a territory in a totally ad hoc pseudo linear way when it could have been all there and iterated using our ontology and framework, which we're here to work on. Dean and then Stephen is the sedan and maybe you can help me because I say when I think about this, the availability piece because it's proximal doesn't mean that it's not on a on a high shelf meaning high threshold."
"Unknown","00;56;50;04","00;57;20;14","And I can't, I can't get the coffee back down that's full of the beans, right? So again, I like what we're doing here, but I still ask when we're talking about affordances, how are we are we are we looking at two ways of describing that at a minimum? Because that's what I'm hoping we're doing. But if we're not, what are we doing Stephen, you were going to you were going to give me some some thoughts around that."
"Unknown","00;57;21;21","00;58;02;05","Yeah. First, Stephen, with the recent you know, that got me thinking. Now, but the question I suppose is as well as well as iterating on, um, you know, we can run multiple examples off of so they might be one of these cases. Like you say, many things can happen, but you could one, you know, you could have two or three types of models that are kind of simple and you run them all many times and see OK, and maybe change some parameters to make it more likely that there's a long term relationship, that there's a perception, binding energy that kind of is exhibited."
"Unknown","00;58;02;14","00;58;27;17","And then you could sort of look for clusters of transitions, clusters of behavioral patterns, right? And so then we're sort of comparing patterns and to some level, then it's in a way it becomes a sense making process for us. And the advantage we've got is we can tap back into our embodiment because we're humans. So we can say, OK, I see in that, what sense do I bring a higher dimension to all of that?"
"Unknown","00;58;27;28","00;58;54;24","Yeah, you can have 500 groups of three separate and make their own active model of a cafe adjacent to a park, but they all have to get that zero to one. Otherwise if they come together, what is there to discuss? 500 times 00. So I wasn't so much thinking, I wasn't so much think about different people. I'm thinking even though the person does the module, you just literally run it lots of times, but slightly different tweaks."
"Unknown","00;58;55;10","00;59;31;01","And then so you get you can sort of get something from that. I would say that's a different type of maybe you start to see some of these patterns that's iterated modeling with getting the first version and then changing parameters and iterating and then looking for patterns across iterations that are achieved via a certain strategy of changing parameters but incomplete model will never run so yes, there's a total space to do stochastic simulation and run one model 5000 times and 5000 different models one time."
"Unknown","00;59;31;01","01;00;05;05","And every other combination, they all are predicated on iterating on something that already is there. And so that's the zero to one phase. Steve I was puzzled how you translate the stories that you find in so many academic papers or semi academic papers. First of all, just the greatest the so say this happens, this happens is how do you turn that into simple, very simple exists, exist person, person enters room and I'm idea and you throw it in the model and if it says contradiction, something's wrong."
"Unknown","01;00;05;13","01;00;33;03","If you're really confident that, hey, that's the way the real world goes, you negate it, you throw a does not exist and you got a universal and run it and it blows up. Now I guess not everybody does. What I said is wrong. Let's find out what I did wrong. Cool stuff. You don't even need the exotic. You don't even need to re create mathematically oriented modeling tool."
"Unknown","01;00;33;04","01;01;01;08","You can just do it in pure yes or no, true or false logic. Just realize that this morning in my head lit up. Nice. Yeah. Take people out their work. Just use their word and they asserted that this. And then I hope they used nouns and verbs. And if so, then you could be able to parse it. So let's we're making a course grained movement model."
"Unknown","01;01;01;14","01;01;22;13","So again, it could be fine step. You could have the affordance be to take a step and the location had to be something else. Fine, great. But we're taking a course. Great. Now we're going to talk about the sense of the agents so their actions are they're movements, which is just a coarse green movement state. That's the actions that they're doing."
"Unknown","01;01;22;13","01;01;50;07","Inference on what are their perceptions we know about the five, 11 and 55 senses. It's not about the scent of coffee in this model. Again, the future model with which thing they bought you could go to what is their sense of smell. But here we're just going to do a sense mapping matrix with light. OK, so the cafe is going to have red light."
"Unknown","01;01;50;09","01;02;17;14","I love red light. So the cafe is going to have basically 80% chance of red light if you're in the dark room, a point to chance of sunlight if you're at the window seat and it's never dark if you're in the park, there's a 100% chance of it being sunlight. There's no there's no red light in the park."
"Unknown","01;02;20;19","01;02;41;12","And there's no darkness in the park. So it's like the daytime. So again, that's iterating. So it's good to keep those things in mind. You like have a coda or a space where you could have everyone's perspective added, even when you're building the first iteration. But some matrices do need to be specified to continue talking about it as an active inference model."
"Unknown","01;02;41;25","01;03;10;10","And then neither will say neither. It's never read. There's a rare red light that the cafe uses, and it's half the time sunny and it's half the time dark because that's who knows, we just have maximal uncertainty, but we know that it's not red. OK, so this is how the A matrix in active inference. If you said you're in a dark room where are you?"
"Unknown","01;03;10;29","01;03;32;07","Well, here, given these simple numbers, we know that we're in neither the cafe or the park. If you said you're in a red light, where are you? You must be in the cafe. It's the only place with a red light. If you said you're in the sun, what is the probability that you're in the park? It's two thirds roughly."
"Unknown","01;03;32;18","01;04;01;09","This is 1.7, and so it's one divided by 1.7 is literally the probability of being in the park, conditioned on seeing sun. So that is Bayesian statistics. It's like we have a matrix of sensory mappings. And then it's like, here's a new observation, it's red. You go, OK, it's point eight over point eight that I'm in the cafe OK, so that is the sense mapping matrix."
"Unknown","01;04;02;13","01;04;38;26","What is the inference on what is the s the hidden state where am I that's not directly observed. You're observing only the photons in this model. So the, the, this is a mapping between the oh, the observations and then the s the states that inference is being done on. But aren't they thinking about their to do list. Yes."
"Unknown","01;04;39;27","01;05;22;28","In the territory keep it in mind. Add a note, add a comment. We want to hear your perspective. That's not the course Green Movement model. So these are acting from teams for simplifying teams. OK, we have the perception which is the sense here. Three states and we have the locations that inference is being done. Now we can talk about preferences, what our preferences for this is like perceptual control theory, percep preferences are over observations so it's like the preference is to observe the body being in homeostasis."
"Unknown","01;05;24;10","01;05;53;22","That's part of the preference specification in active so one could imagine that if somebody had no preference for any of the I don't really care then they would move proportionally to the ratio of the transitions of the Affordance matrix. So if all the transition frequencies were even and there was no preference over sensory outcomes, you would be evenly distributed."
"Unknown","01;05;54;28","01;06;34;07","If there is a preference for darkness, no matter how slight and there's any ability to move into the neither, then that will be the attractor because individuals will dwell in a more preferred state because they prefer the darkness which is only accessed here if there's a preference strong, then you exaggerate it like a strong preference for sun. We would see, like everyone or almost everyone in the park, a weak preference for sun would only slightly bias towards the park."
"Unknown","01;06;36;04","01;07;02;23","D. Yeah, I think I'm asking should we assume that your preference is to be violently caffeinated or caffeinated, like verdant and not being a smart apple? I'm asking that. Is that the assumption that we're building our model around? Because you asked here's here's the interesting thing about this model as we're building it in the first iteration, the sense is visual."
"Unknown","01;07;04;05","01;07;47;22","So there's no coffee in this model. No, I know, but why isn't there? Right. So if we could we could talk about a different affordance matrix, a different sense mapping. It could be interception, it could be m I excited or not. And then do I prefer to be excited or relaxed? So just two introspective states. Then there's an affordance which is to drink coffee or not, which is to have some probability of moving you from one state to another."
"Unknown","01;07;48;04","01;08;23;14","OK, coffee is increasing your likelihood of getting excited versus not doesn't. That is not a spatial model so now we could make that preference over half a nation states and that's like a module that's going to compose very interoperable with a spatial model because the affordance vector, the sense vectors, those can be heterogeneous that can be here's the three by three spatial and the two by two caffeine."
"Unknown","01;08;23;14","01;08;46;26","And those are sub matrices. And it does turn out that the cafes where that affordance is enables and there isn't the affordance for the coffee in your in the park. But those are two types of observations. There's the photon observation which we're using as a proxy for location, and then there'd be the interception which is related to the cafe nation state."
"Unknown","01;08;47;15","01;09;14;00","And then those could be combined and you can have a joint density, overcaffeinated and location and then policies like where to move could be selected based upon the long term expected free energy given the preferences and affordances of that agents. So there are different modules that can be composed in an integrative modeling framework for perception, action and cognition hashtag active inference."
"Unknown","01;09;14;06","01;09;49;07","Dean And then Stephen. Yeah. Just real quickly, I was going to say I was going to answer my own question. I think then in terms of a preference confirmation, the iconography on the side of the Cup would seem to fit with within the niche as well. So maybe it's, maybe it's a large acacia tree in green. So I wasn't seeing it in the sense that we were I don't want to drag this off course, want to actually reinforce the idea of how preferences align as opposed to saying, why are we including that?"
"Unknown","01;09;49;15","01;09;55;07","I'm kind of reinforcing the sense mapping matrix. Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","01;10;01;28","01;10;31;19","Hello. Yeah, yeah, I think this is I suppose one thing I'd like to check in with though, as we're just doing this check a little bit differently, you got you kind of got the Dianetics you kind of got a John Tech huge. And they got the OK, I can make a choice between the affordances for action. And so it's sort of coming slightly from a more deductive kind of scripts triggering world, which is useful."
"Unknown","01;10;32;23","01;11;24;20","I'm also wondering, there could be, say, for instance, that that sense mapping matrix as well as it being something that, you know, links someone's preferences back to where they go more broadly. So that's quite useful. But I'm wondering also if someone's navigating a space and there's there's maybe within the camp, there's some read this and some this. And Doc, you know, I know you talked about embedding there's there's there's a question about like is there a tendency to to move towards the on tick type of structuring because it kind of takes us there."
"Unknown","01;11;25;14","01;12;02;29","And if there was to be a kind of a more gradient based transition that's happening in relation to the space it might be different. You know, how much does this adapt to that or does it need to be rethought in terms of the type of modeling? OK, so this is of course great model. So to say that it's 8.8 read in the cafe and point two in Sun in the cafe corresponds to 20% of the locations have sunlight on them."
"Unknown","01;12;03;15","01;12;46;03","So one could then make a sub model where at table one it's 100% sunny. So you're still in a sub matrix that core screens to 8020 but there's two tables that are in the sun and then there's eight that are in the RET. So then you would have Affordance matrix within the cafe sub matrix of moving over ten by ten tables, but one can see that as you include more rows in the matrix, you get exponential explosion and that proposes computational challenges and just like parameter identification challenges because maybe you never saw someone go from seven to two, but it's not that it can't happen, it just there's only 80 people who went to the"
"Unknown","01;12;46;03","01;13;06;23","shop and there's a hundred transitions. So it just you're not going to see all them. So then you get a very poor estimate of 100 parameters. That's why we're talking about modeling, not what is happening in the territory this is going to give you some course grain results. Then the sense mapping matrix is preference free. It is not a preference matrix."
"Unknown","01;13;07;04","01;13;35;04","The preference matrix C is where the preferences are specified over sensory outcomes only. So here's Dean who has like a nine to three of right over son. Now Dave has one point, one to one. So they both prefer red over son, but we can see in the Model Stream one, Ryan Smith and Christopher White, we talked about like what these numbers mean, the ratio, the absolute amount, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;13;35;08","01;13;59;09","So we're going to talk about it here. But Dean has a stronger preference for red over son, whereas Dave has a weak preference for red over some OK, so we have the preferences over the observations. Can we have the affordances, coarse grained movement, not the elbow motion, not which table coarse grained movement? We know that we could make a sub matrix."
"Unknown","01;14;00;06","01;14;27;14","Then there's the action states, which is moving from one to another then there's perceptions, the observations, the sensor states, those are photons, not location, but there's a matrix now that could be a fixed matrix or it could be learned, but we're just starting with a fixed matrix. We have preferences over observations those are only over colors of light."
"Unknown","01;14;27;14","01;15;01;07","And so for Dean, it's just a vector of three, but we're just contrasting two different agents that are in this cafe area. Then we have expectations. So expectations are the generative model. What would be expected observations. And so Dean says, I'm the kind of person who expects and prefers read a lot that will shape which of these affordances are taken."
"Unknown","01;15;02;17","01;15;35;15","And so Dave and Dean can have the same sense mapping matrix. They don't differ in how they infer where they are, given the photons but the affordances can also be the same and they'll have different behavior. So that's how you get agent specific behavior from a model like this. You can have agents with the same preference, but they differ in affordances or some other combination that's iterating and enriching a model and then just one thing here before we go to the question, Steven."
"Unknown","01;15;35;15","01;16;08;08","So what is the niche? So yes, again, the territory with the everything is just everything in the world. But the niche is the generative process. So the agent is the generative model and the niche is the generative process that's actually like handing those observations to the agent. In this case, it's just the emission of photons. It's literally just the light source is the niche because we're making a super simple model where the only observation that's getting handed from the niche is photon."
"Unknown","01;16;09;10","01;16;32;24","So the only thing we need to say for the niche is it's the process, the hidden process that emits photons. Maybe it's a red light bulb, maybe it's red cellophane and it's white light, or that's the hidden generative process. The niche in this case is just the process that emits observations to the agent so that they can then integrate that into their generative model."
"Unknown","01;16;33;28","01;16;56;21","Stephen, did you want to? Yeah. Yeah, I think, I mean, well, the necessary emission of photons, you could say it's like the perception of light is it could be perception. The agent perceives the observation of light, but the niche is the process that gives rise to agents observations. Right. OK, if you take it from the red, it red is not photons."
"Unknown","01;16;56;21","01;17;15;23","That's the perception of space without getting into what is red. Do we see that? We're talking about the mapping between the perception of what is called in English red and the location state and the location state? Not exactly. And so you then go well to questions. One questions, you know, the left you've got 930 as opposed to doesn't."
"Unknown","01;17;15;23","01;17;43;16","So how would you scale that line? Would you do it? So they always number one is the highest and you've actually gone above one there. So is that they use a different how would you scale what the maximum is? Yeah. So this is what we talked about in module stream one with Brian Smith. But basically these numbers do get normalized to some to one to be a proper probability in a soft max function."
"Unknown","01;17;44;01","01;18;08;04","Oh, I see. You just sums the board up and then Dubai know sums them all up and then that's how you get the probability D proper from this. But then the ability to have it go beyond just one. So that's the difference between like, you know, five and one versus 50 and ten, depending on the generative model, those might behave very, very differently."
"Unknown","01;18;08;22","01;18;35;02","Going yeah. Just first of all, this is fantastic to build it in real time, but I want to just now ask a question so so and then in real terms, we've built this model and it kind of makes us aware of things that we maybe wouldn't be aware of because we weren't in the active inference realm. But now my question is so so now is this is this also projection all?"
"Unknown","01;18;35;24","01;19;00;05","What kind of inferences do we make off this in terms of agents go, don't go because that's weapon to me. Then that's when the real value is realized because we can't predict with certainty who goes and who doesn't, who ends up at the cafe with the coffee and who stays at home and watches friends. Right. So how so?"
"Unknown","01;19;00;10","01;19;49;06","We've got this. This is fantastic. But now we want to get to a place where a person who normally would be somewhat risk averse takes this and goes, oh my goodness, this opened up something that I would normally never have gone, but now I'm prepared to go. Does it help? Do you think this work helps that person? Just off the top of your head, because I know it helps me, helps you, but that person who is trying to do this on that decision branch moment how does it make how does making them aware of this alter their thinking I think it does a few things, some of which we've seen in the past few minutes,"
"Unknown","01;19;49;16","01;20;21;00","others which probably remain to be explored. It's separates out observations from the state that's being inferred because it'd be very easy just to simply say, well, I prefer the cafe oh, I'm observing Red in the cafe and I prefer Red. So by having the preferences over outcomes and then separating the observed outcome from the inferred hidden state, if you like, you like spicy food."
"Unknown","01;20;21;00","01;20;39;25","That's why you say you like this kind of food. So pull it back to these matrices. Let's just say that they knew all the options. Maybe people are not aware of all the affordances that they can even take, or maybe they have something to add themselves. So this is like saying this is like, these are all your chess moves."
"Unknown","01;20;40;21","01;21;05;01","We're not. We're playing chess so we're not even going to worry about, you know, knocking the pieces off the table. Like we're playing a well-mannered chess game. But we can modify the rules. But, you know, we're playing with the affordances. So somebody might have their mind expanded by just considering all the affordances that are available. Like, why? I guess I could go to the art museum in the city, but I'm not that kind of person."
"Unknown","01;21;05;14","01;21;43;10","It just hadn't even seemed to me. So by bringing that regime of attention to affordances, we're seeing the whole space. Then people can separate out the outcomes that they have preferences over for the hidden states. And then affordances are the actions that modify the transition probability of the hidden states actions. That's like where the pie plugs into the B, which is intermediate between the extra time the pie policy doesn't plug in to changing the state."
"Unknown","01;21;44;00","01;22;08;03","You don't have an affordance for red light, you have an affordance to move to a location that you've inferred has hired red light. So there's probably many other approaches, but this sort of like gets the whole map out there in terms of the space of the possible, which is again, we're saying that is the space of the possible."
"Unknown","01;22;08;03","01;22;44;26","It's not like there's some other secret affordance. And then you can have a conversation about how people map their perceptions, which can include internal perceptions like being bored or being sad or happy. That's the whole mental action they can map their preferences over observations to inference on states and the affordances that get them there doing well. OK, OK."
"Unknown","01;22;44;26","01;23;20;22","I'm sorry you you froze for a minute there partway through your explanation. So if I'm saying something back that you already answered, I apologize. But so this kind of to me now, OK, so now that we talking about regime of attention because you were still I still heard that part, that kind of goes back to one of those livestreams before where we were, I think I mentioned is it about time on task because we can now measure that because that's now something that we've easy to measure or is it still about what have we made available to ourselves?"
"Unknown","01;23;21;05","01;23;47;18","And so what we get a sense of in terms of what we might be missing in terms of change blindness as one example, versus what we now again, what, what are what how we've expanded our awareness as opposed to what we've given more attention over to. Because again, my sense is it's it's easy to measure what I'm paying attention to."
"Unknown","01;23;47;27","01;24;22;05","It's more difficult, but probably more valuable to know what what the possibilities are in terms of that 80, 20 that I may not have been conscious of before. Does that does that make sense to you? Because that's that's how I see this eventually moving on a gradient descent. Yes. So these are a single level agents right now. Like they don't have metacognition, so they're not like, I'm unsure about something or I'm sad about something, but I'm seeing two cases where regime of attention applies."
"Unknown","01;24;22;05","01;24;47;16","It doesn't apply in this current model, two regimes of attention, one would be like an intra model regime of attention, like we could have in this agent a metacognitive attentional layer that is either paying attention or not to sensory outcomes. And if they're not paying attention to it, it's going to slip by. And it's like the gradient is flat."
"Unknown","01;24;48;06","01;25;29;06","And then the more attention they pay, the sharper they're going to realize their preferences is like, wow, it is really sunny out here and I prefer red light. So I'm going to go because I was brought my attention to it. Then there's sort of this like XO model where you're talking about bringing people's attention to different parts of the model now that itself could be an active recursive model, but that's like using this model to draw, to both expand people's to the space of the possible and then direct their regime of attention to certain phenomena or attributes of this model."
"Unknown","01;25;29;18","01;25;35;16","So there's I think there's a link to little bit separate uses, but they both apply."
"Unknown","01;25;37;24","01;26;05;03","Do you think do you think the second one because if I go or I don't go, both of them give me a feedback loop that I learn from. Right. So do you think the second one is nuanced, different than the first or quite radically different from the first? Because I know if I don't go that's quite, quite different, that's the zero."
"Unknown","01;26;05;12","01;26;40;03","And if I do go, that's the one negative. They're quite separable and quite discrete. What is what you're describing more of that blur? I wasn't in on the third one, I think it was where there was no line drawn in the sand and so I'm wondering and now I'm wondering about that because again, ultimately, if we could take this off the page and use it and actually use it in ways that give us more prediction matter, expertize boom, so what do you think?"
"Unknown","01;26;40;21","01;27;09;04","Yeah, let me type something, Stephen. Anything, two other I would do it. Do it, and I'll say what I was going to say. So it adds, but it's a slightly different point. So I want to just let you finish this point. And then, OK, so the first case of the regime of attention is going to be we do a recursive layer in this agent's so that they can be paying attention to something or not."
"Unknown","01;27;09;12","01;27;38;15","OK? Yep. Yep. Time and energy a done. Yeah. So the second the sort of application or communication of the model would be deploying this I don't even know. It's like a meta slash exo model, like bring deploy. Are you, are you coming up with new ways of describing things not during a livestream. We don't do that. We do that before and then we rehearse, remember?"
"Unknown","01;27;40;04","01;28;07;17","So you could use this model to bring the policy planners attention to something. So again, you distinguished there was first just stating the space of the possible so that's not an active secret like the, the policy. My oh, I guess I never really thought people would move from the park to the cafe oh. I was thinking how people would get to the park and then how they'd get to the cafe, but I didn't realize that they would move between them."
"Unknown","01;28;08;06","01;28;40;07","Maybe that literally happens. So that's just like a movement matrix. Any kind of systems thinking or design thinking or agent based model would converge on that. Any kind of iterated modeling. OK, but we're talking about what active could direct their regime of attention towards. So let's just say that we had a nice polished dashboard for this CAFE movement simulation."
"Unknown","01;28;41;02","01;29;12;26","And then we had two kinds of people, somebody with visuals scenario A and visual scenario B. So maybe it could be anything. It could be their their preferences over ramps children love ramps. Some people cannot move up them. Some people love Bright, some people loved art. OK, so you can say there are we're going to just say there's two kinds of agents in this simulation and we'd like to bring your attention."
"Unknown","01;29;13;26","01;30;01;08","Policy planner your preference over observations, which is like local businesses being intact, people hanging out in the park during these times a day. You have these preferences over observations. We're kind of meeting you and we're seeing those. Your observations are our outputs our model is outputting the things that you are observing and caring and preferring over. We've done a suite of model explorations and it seems a little counterintuitive, but adding a red streetlight in the park changes how people use it."
"Unknown","01;30;03;17","01;30;40;11","Nope, nobody would have suggested the red street light, but we know that there's people who love red light. And it turns out that just having one red street light, it makes it great for them. That has totally changed the flow. Steady state, non equilibrium, steady state reflecting in a tractor in our model yeah, that has changed. And we can see these suite of simulations that and we're just going to call your attention to this graph and call your attention to how the points go higher on the y axis as the x axis dial changes."
"Unknown","01;30;40;20","01;31;04;17","But it turns out we don't want only red light in the park so we ran a simulation from zero to one red in sun, half and half and every combination. And so there's some curve and we'll draw your attention to the point where that curve is. That's a great first step and we'll iterate because it's an open source model and we're in conversation with you and then we'll be able to test."
"Unknown","01;31;06;00","01;31;55;16","So the map and then the allocation of numbers on the map is kind of like the regime of attention that's our affordances as modelers. And then there's that layer of communicating it clearly with strings of natural and computer language and visuals so that the regime of attention of something not in your model at the core level, like the policy planner they're like, Oh yeah, I guess I do expect and prefer this, and here's somebody who's giving me that expectation and preference and a toolkit for counterfactuals and elaboration and their outcomes are my incomes OK, thank you."
"Unknown","01;31;56;18","01;32;20;04","No, but that's I think that's helpful because at the end of the day, there there's somebody who's actually observing this and putting it into into each one of these cells, but I'm not sure that the people that are actually doing it are necessarily aware of it. And so my question is, once they become aware of it, what can they do with what's the value to that?"
"Unknown","01;32;21;19","01;32;51;26","Yeah. So it's like the the first rung of the model, you know, the person is moving. We could do mean field approximation, really simple. We could do the trajectory based particle simulation. OK, then what's outside of our model and the sort of boutique step is communicating to the policy planner. But now let's just say that I, the modeler, include the policy planner in this model or they have a different model now."
"Unknown","01;32;52;01","01;33;27;24","The outcome of the that model is being passed to me. So you never get around the notion that there's like a boutique level of communication of the model. But the idea is that like critical infrastructure could be inside the model and the boutique communication could be to the public. And then we would have functional infrastructure and good communication instead of little sub ad hoc modules for critical infrastructure with boutique communication among them."
"Unknown","01;33;28;13","01;34;09;24","So that any tenuous wrapper drawn around all the critical infrastructure is going to be incoherent, then that incoherent blanket cannot be communicated out another level. Yep. I think you're reinforcing the idea of the difference between structuralism and interaction and what you're describing there is kind of the way finder rule sort of coinciding with the person who's way finding stuff cool maybe we'll have templates, guidebooks, playbooks, workshop, all those things, like what is the right order?"
"Unknown","01;34;09;26","01;34;45;15","They're probably not only one order. But again, if we don't have a model to discuss, it's going to be like getting to point one and then to zero. And then there's the grass and the grass is alive, and then the grasses, viruses and or viruses is alive. And what is green? It's like kind of these like false starts but I think once it connects, even conceptually, we didn't write this in code, it's not even pseudocode, but once it conceptually connects and then we can say, OK, let's make Affordance Matrix E one and then let's pick E two."
"Unknown","01;34;46;03","01;35;18;02","So just like it's an alternate hypothesis on difference matrix then we have, you know, A1 and A2, just two hypotheses on the mapping between hidden states and observations. And then we're going to run a two by two model simulation e one A1 E, one A2, e to A1, e two A2. Now we're doing decision supports and it's up to us because that's the on models is our decisions, our preferences over the outcomes that we're seeing."
"Unknown","01;35;18;19","01;35;53;11","Oh, I like the E to a A1 because I prefer people to be in the park. And then the cafe owner says, I looked at that one and I like that one, oh, we're modeling ourselves, making this decision, and you like people to be in the park and I like people to be in the cafe. We have a different preference, so we're not going to eliminate tension, but that's actually a conversation to have versus I consulted this group and they made this PDF and you did this and they did it a word file."
"Unknown","01;35;54;10","01;36;23;08","It's a different file type. They wrote in a different language. They're not informationally integrated. What is the comparison? Cool. You know, a consultant. But then this is a way where it's people may call it transparent. I'm not sure how transparent massive statistical models will ever truly be. But maybe it's kind of like a transparent engine. It doesn't mean it's made of glass."
"Unknown","01;36;23;22","01;36;53;18","It means like there's a window into it. So here we can see the pieces going in. There's no side door, there's no other matrix. If we specify the partially observable Markov decision process, the MVP, those are the pieces that went in, and the connectors are also established. Then we used a message passing algorithm or some other approach to find parameters so which part of that would you like us to interact on?"
"Unknown","01;36;54;15","01;37;23;28","I mean, that's an actual conversation and then even if somebody doesn't know about one part, they could still be included in that dialog, perhaps? Din Yeah, and that that again, you touched on it, you kind of circle back to a couple times and you actually used the word support, but it's support or serve or contribute that's kind of the one constant, regardless of what, how it, how it sketches out."
"Unknown","01;37;24;00","01;37;52;11","That's the one thing that seems to run through this as a constant what, how active inference actually supports what and what inevitably gets kicked over. But we observe at the end of the day, right, like we're doing this, we're using limited high energy electrons and our attention and our finite life and everything like that, all these resources so that we can have decision support in this example."
"Unknown","01;37;52;25","01;38;17;08","And then we undertake a policy that modifies the niche, modifies the generative process, but that's on mild. Again, we are at the first level where we don't even have the construction site. So then we have the model where I can choose to change a light bulb from the you know, maybe we can add a natural light into the cafe that would be the next."
"Unknown","01;38;17;08","01;38;42;08","That would be like an active model of agents using an acronym for model. And then that model would still have this boutique layer that has to be communicated informally. And that's like kind of the connective tissue where you have something that's like API, MVP interfacing with the world. It has to have some sort of an interface like that."
"Unknown","01;38;43;02","01;39;09;16","Steven then, you know, I think this is really helpful in the affordances. Thinking of affordances is effectively the setting up for the action policy and the generative business model. So it's say, OK, in this case, this affordances to better stay or move and what I think is really helpful I'm excited about is and this so it comes down to those two might like, right?"
"Unknown","01;39;09;17","01;39;36;23","So the dynamic availability or the the this could be happening at different rates. You can have the same model that's here nested at different speeds let's not use the simple rates of recursion, i.e. this is general idea that someone coming they go to the cafes and they chose to go to a part of the cafe. This might be happening over ten, 20 seconds and they make a choice of where they are."
"Unknown","01;39;37;01","01;40;01;07","There might be something about people leaving the cafe and certain areas over the period of 10 minutes. But there's also like I'm walking towards a cafe and I can be making choices. I can be making an intuition about what affordances to say or move to. I go in the cafes or go to the park and I can be thinking about it."
"Unknown","01;40;01;07","01;40;22;06","I can turn, I can change my position. I could. I could be flipping and shopping actually maybe once every half a second over a period of maybe 10 seconds and then once I walk through the door, I'm in the queue. I'm pretty much like in I'm going to be staying for a while. Right? So now I'm in the right now."
"Unknown","01;40;22;06","01;40;40;07","So my the rate at which the same idea of the affordances being used could be now happiness is slightly different. Nested speeds, right? Because, OK, if I'll maybe choose, I mean here now I'm going to say for a minute or I sit down and then it's like I'm getting into a good conversation. Am I going to say for 10 minutes?"
"Unknown","01;40;40;23","01;41;16;13","And they're different, but they're the same in some ways. So they're different, Chronos. But there's a cross that links the timeliness together, and that's why categorical cybernetics and event oriented cognition like Martin Butcher's recent guest stream, the events is I'm ordering there's a beginning and an end to that. Now, within that matrix or within that event context, it could be playing out at a second by seconds, but then in a different event context, it can be a different model."
"Unknown","01;41;16;23","01;41;45;27","And the higher level is which context am I in? What is the event? So that I think will go a very long way towards going from like that kind of auto ethnographic narrative of like I was, I was jangling and I was moving my elbows sort of in that event context. You do have the model like I was getting a taxi maybe that has a different spatial temporal scale, different set of affordances."
"Unknown","01;41;46;21","01;42;11;06","And then for our model, not for the real world, which isn't changing, but then in our model we say, OK, once you're in the taxi, the event is in taxi and we're only going to look at block by block, or then we slow the model down in the simulation or something like that. When the event context changes and then we're doing inference at the higher level on which event context we're in."
"Unknown","01;42;12;08","01;42;45;15","So we would have a way to talk about that and iterate and include all the richness in the sub matrices and pull back to the core screen when we have to do that. Dean says that tastic because it's really helping me. I hope it's helping me. Everybody else is watching and participating. So again, what I'm hearing is a very clear line being drawn between something, what we might describe as goal, direct behavior and the relationship that we are trying to proscribe in three tables."
"Unknown","01;42;46;06","01;43;21;04","And it's the relationship between those three tables as opposed to a specific outcome which we in our minds say we want to achieve or realized or recapitulate versus building out a relationship through support, through serving through contribution. But that is that is not a goal that stays on the relational level, never to collapse underneath that out of that plots out these goals that can be directed behaviorally."
"Unknown","01;43;21;16","01;43;49;08","But but if I'm if I'm misinterpreting this or am I laying something over this that reconfirms my biases push back on this. But I think what we continue to do is reinforce the difference between what we're doing here in terms of a model and what effects that can potentiate versus a model that has a specific wick and an idealized and a particular outcome."
"Unknown","01;43;49;17","01;44;14;26","Am I am I overstepping or overreaching? No. Thanks for sharing how you see it. I think the only piece I caught on is goal isn't an active ontology. We have preferences and expectations, and then we adjust. We trim tab so that we realize those observations. And so it's like, I want to be under the finish line at the four minute and 52nd mile."
"Unknown","01;44;15;11","01;44;56;23","That's the observation I wants. Not my goal is to run a 450 mile. So then there's actually policy selection, how you get there. And this is from a paper that I'll release very, very soon. Here's just a re visualization of the MVP that we've seen many times. It's a little bit adapted from the Mental Action Sandford Smith Paper and a few other sources, but basically we have this discrete time period and then we have see the preferences e the affordances, the possible policies that can be taken and G, which is the expected free energy calculation."
"Unknown","01;44;57;01","01;45;26;17","That's the minimization component. Those play into Pi PI influences B, which is the state transition mapping of underlying hidden states. In our model, that was where one is inferred to be, but not what they're observing B is only changing how states transfer to each other. A which we had is the sense mapping matrix is mapping from the observation is which were photons emitted by the generative process, the niche."
"Unknown","01;45;27;11","01;45;50;17","A is intermediating between the photon and the inference on where you are. Sometimes it's really obvious if it's dark, you're not in the cafe or the park. If it's red, you're more likely to be in the cafe. You used to be totally likely, but now you're pretty sure because we added that red light to the park. And then there's uncertainty estimates which can be fixed or learned on all of this."
"Unknown","01;45;51;04","01;46;22;10","And this is not the only model architecture. This is a model architecture that we're using to integrate perception, cognition and action and impact service contribution. Stephen Yeah, thanks. Dan. It's really helpful and talking about these three to relating. So as the model is at the moment, you know, top affordance matrix which gives the policy options, you know, it's giving us sort of the states the possible choices."
"Unknown","01;46;22;10","01;46;53;02","So it's fairly set. Okay. But those the sense mapping in the preference preference matrix and you could put that temperature into that or you could put variation of how much. So for instance, at certain scales, you know, generally speaking, the room was red when I went to the cafe. But when you're in the cafe and the lights, maybe the sun goes behind, a cloud comes out again, you know, maybe in different, there's different rates at which that can be fluctuating a little bit."
"Unknown","01;46;53;02","01;47;21;27","Maybe my preferences as I'm starting to think about what I like in cafes in general, and then I'm saying, well, you know what I actually quite like in this one, right? So but what this does but even within this model is, you know, you could start to not only change the values, but you could change how much the values either just by temperature or noise fluctuate or maybe there's a tempo oscillation."
"Unknown","01;47;21;27","01;47;41;20","You know, maybe you say, okay, this one goes has the ability to change within these parameters over a five second period, over a five minute period or what's happening below perception. You know, there's a because with circadian. So you could say, okay, maybe someone doesn't notice there's a dark part of the room because it's just one table in the corner, right?"
"Unknown","01;47;42;00","01;48;10;29","So there's something nice about even within this model, you've got the ability to start to get this nested hierarchy. Yeah. Like if you have an uncertainty and you allow the parameters to be learnable, in your model, not debating whether people actually are learning, just we're going to test two models. One where they cannot learn the mapping, one where they can learn the mapping, or we're going to test one where it's just visual versus a sense."
"Unknown","01;48;11;25","01;48;41;13","It might smell like coffee more outside in the park than in the café because that's where they event. So that could be learned and understood. And somebody at the first part, oh, of course, it's going to smell more like coffee in the cafe. It might not. So it doesn't have to be the direction people expect it can be included in the prior D That was the only letter they didn't mention was that's how you get to the first state in the Markov chain is with the prior."
"Unknown","01;48;42;04","01;49;04;04","And so you can have high uncertainty over prior. Just say like I don't know where I am. And I'm very uncertain or I'm certain I don't know where I am or any other number of combinations. And then the Bayesian information criterion, just to add like one more little technical note. So the B, C, it's related to AIC, but the by sea, it's basically it's a value."
"Unknown","01;49;04;04","01;49;23;03","Bic is going to be something related to the number of parameters. That's the K term, that's the number of parameters times the natural log of the number of data points. So that's like are you fitting 50 parameters on one data point? I mean, you can imagine that those are going to be very poor estimates versus like one parameter on FIFO."
"Unknown","01;49;23;20","01;49;55;10","So then that one parameter, that's not the world, right? It's a model. We're talking about statistical modeling -2 times the natural log of the likelihood function. So this is like model complexity minus model accuracy. So then we can say, OK, I'm testing three different Affordance Matrixes, one is the three by three, one is a nine by nine because I've split each of the zones into three parts and there's like the window was very sunny and then 5050 and then a very red part."
"Unknown","01;49;56;02","01;50;21;27","And then I have another one where it's 500 by 500 and like the first ten columns are the same because like they're all sunny and then the second one are all the same and they're very similar to the first ten. One can imagine that depending on what kind of data they have and how much data they have, they might find that the by sea through the three by three, nine by nine or 9000 by 9000 model is supported."
"Unknown","01;50;22;22","01;50;55;25","And so that wouldn't be saying the Territory is three by three, nine or 900. It wouldn't even be saying that the map is three by three, nine by nine, nine. It'd be like saying this is a Perito optimal Bayes optimal statistical model that's on a frontier manifold between explaining variance while reducing model complexity. So it's like that's the level above the map and that's where the big C and model selection comes into play."
"Unknown","01;50;56;09","01;51;25;06","You don't just do the bottom up and then finish your model at the zero to one. That's the iterating. We could have a whole network or matrix of models and then have principled ways of selecting among them and adding a new data. Designing counterfactuals. What would be the most informative data point to obtain or what would be a perturbation that would distinguish these two different hypotheses?"
"Unknown","01;51;25;21","01;52;10;14","Those are the kind of maximum information foraging questions because the amount to which policy as a modeler will reduce my uncertainty about dot, dot, dot that might be formalized in this matter. ExoMars or or it might not be, but we can use like active quant as our kernel and then active qual as our wrapper hashtag dot coms. Dave And then Steven have activities of navigating among models at various scales and topologies that been as you've been describing."
"Unknown","01;52;10;24","01;52;20;20","Have those been observed adequately to tell to what degree free energy is being minimized during that evolution?"
"Unknown","01;52;23;05","01;53;02;03","That's a great question. Potentially for Marten Boots or for someone else, which is kind of the first principles, unifying theory angle, which we didn't even mention today in Active would be like this would we have a common currency or could we understand actions selected in different contexts as being in the same game of reducing expected free energy? So then could we look at like we have the sub matrices within Cafe Park and neither?"
"Unknown","01;53;02;24","01;53;42;16","And then like we're looking at the fine scale transitions as in a free energy minimizing process and the macro transition. And then looking at how like small and large changes in expected free energy are related to sort of micro and macro transitions in a hierarchical model is all you're asking Yeah. Whether using this modeling framework exhibits the kind of behavior that allows you to evaluate the free energy principle and its friends in input in the real world."
"Unknown","01;53;43;08","01;54;08;10","And for one thing, our people just plain turning on data collection adequately. Donald Knuth did that way decades ago when he was developing latex. He turned on this massive data collection. Everybody in his organization was feeding in exactly to every key press is being captured. And then he ran matrix metrics on that. And he says, well, this is where we're putting our attention."
"Unknown","01;54;08;13","01;54;30;04","I'm trying to make things easier and I'm making them harder. Well, that's wrong. Let's start working. And if he hadn't collect the data, you know, he would he wouldn't have been able to give all those speeches about how how it worked and how you study the ecology of software development. This stuff is a lot cooler than anything that he ever did."
"Unknown","01;54;31;05","01;55;00;23","I think that we're moving from a zero to one to a continuous deployment of models landscape, which puts us squarely within the scope of active because we're no longer doing descriptive analysis, like how was this car made? We're doing like continuous deployment on the ship, a thesis, and that is going to give a lot more information and then whatever information is collected will respect that as being observations."
"Unknown","01;55;01;08","01;55;24;26","So whether we have every keypress and every mouse movement and the pupil diameter and the eye gaze and the natural language processing on the live stream and and and all of those things it still would just be observations and let them debate whether it's all them ones that we need. But then we'll specify our matrices. We'll use by C iterate with the real world."
"Unknown","01;55;25;19","01;55;53;02","And yeah, I think that between the get commits and the language use and the absolute accuracy or validity of the model, there would be quite some interesting patterns to see like does as the accuracy versus get commits. Do you like go really fast up and then dip and then recover accuracy. Do you have a prolonged period of low accuracy followed by like a phase?"
"Unknown","01;55;53;02","01;56;14;28","Transition was like a once we added in the sense of smell, it just was like, wow, then it fit or is it like some other dynamic or how does that relate to the language use? How does it relate to the saliva cortisol metabolite? Like there's no end to what you could bring into the model because they're just observations."
"Unknown","01;56;15;17","01;56;52;20","And then the relationships among different kinds of observations is something that's learned and we'll use the besi and related techniques like Bayesian model reduction and Structure Learning, which Freeston pointed to as the key open problem in the DART Tools section of our June 21 symposium structure. Learning is how you go from just proposing variance on matrices and exploding your model space to actually finding models that are on that frontier of being useful So very interesting question, Dave."
"Unknown","01;56;52;20","01;57;17;14","Thank you, Stephen. Are there any closing, closing round of thoughts you're there now? So I will just say that that was really helpful. To have this diagram here. So just because you got so you got preferences and affordances for action straddling, you can see my hands straddling the strategy which is coming from all the sensory kind of interpretations, so to speak."
"Unknown","01;57;17;14","01;57;38;24","And one question I've got is you know, you've got uncertainties there, and I know this just purely more from an instrumental kind of practical point is as it influences at the moment, there and it's kind of like I suppose you've got a big matrix and the uncertainties could be flips. They flip on and off what's available, you know, it's like you can move, you can't move if you have to, you have to stay."
"Unknown","01;57;38;29","01;57;56;05","Maybe at some point you've got no choice. You've got to stay right whereas in the other ones the numbers. So it could be you could vary them so you would try and change. You would you would treat those matrices slightly differently because the other one you read the switch and on and off options for what you could do."
"Unknown","01;57;56;05","01;58;17;05","And down, lower down, you could do something to change that number between either a 01 or whatever. So yeah, just wondering what your thoughts are on that. Yes. So this is just one architecture and one representation and so I be totally open to being wrong in these points. But I'll just bring up what I think is interesting about that."
"Unknown","01;58;18;12","01;58;56;08","Notice that the uncertainty is on a not Oh, so you could say my thermometer says 22.2, but I don't know how that maps to the real temperature because it's a noisy thermometer. That's zero ambiguity about the thermometer. So if but if you say, I'm not even sure what the thermometer says, it's 20 something, then you need another model with what is the visual observation mapping to the thermometer reading, mapping to the temperature."
"Unknown","01;58;56;20","01;59;16;16","So uncertainty in that just one interesting point is it's not connected to Oh I see. But of course we have uncertainty about what we're seeing. It's a blur, right? But if you don't even know if you saw it or not, you're even another level removed. So you could be uncertain about the mapping from whatever the thermometer says to temperature."
"Unknown","01;59;16;17","01;59;35;10","The extreme case being you're so uncertain about the mapping of a that even when you visually see it says 22, you're just like, I literally got no information on the real temp or it could be a tight mapping, but that's one thing that doesn't have an uncertainty associated with it any and not that it couldn't. It's just that maybe it doesn't need to."
"Unknown","01;59;35;27","02;00;16;27","And then the other one is, as you pointed out, there's no uncertainty over PI that I find quite interesting. And I think the reason why is we're not doing inference on PI we're conditioning all of our analysis, conditioning, our free energy calculation, horizontal line on PI. So we're saying there's three options and I'm conditioning the expected free energy of one, two or three conditioned on selecting one, two or three."
"Unknown","02;00;18;18","02;00;39;11","So it is a little bit of a different variable. And also action is not in this. It's implicitly in there because the B matrix, which we can have uncertainty on in how the B matrix, how policy's map to be and how B maps to states. So a technical phrasing would have to clarify like, you know what, I drew the red line here to the middle of the edge."
"Unknown","02;00;39;11","02;01;08;16","Is that an uncertainty on the mapping of PI to be or is that a mapping on so it's not a technical claim, it's a visual artifact. But I think it might be possible to have no uncertainty on observation and no uncertainty on policy, and that could just compress the computational complexity by a huge amount and all the other ambiguity could actually be like very nicely dealt with elsewhere."
"Unknown","02;01;09;06","02;01;46;18","But if it's like I'm just thinking of other examples people can probably imagine if there's uncertainty on what policy you're conditioning on. I think the analysis starts to lose sense like conditioned on left or right. Am I going to get the food that makes sense, conditioned on? I'm not sure if I'm going left or right I don't see how there could be anything other than you don't know it's not a conditional, so you can't get a marginal likelihood from a Bayesian perspective."
"Unknown","02;01;47;18","02;02;08;13","So yeah. Stephen Yeah. Last last, last for I suppose this one is such that questions like just do it sort of thing, isn't it, with the policy is like you've got the option of just doing it right? So you say, OK, I'm just going to do it and run with it. So I don't have the benefit of actually then going and starting to tweak it all the time."
"Unknown","02;02;08;14","02;02;29;04","But you've got that all round. The point is, let's put it all around in the conditionality I think you just said and then run it and then I suppose it is, is what it is and it's some of these the best you've got. So you know, if you're an organism, basically the policy you've got is the policy you've got though."
"Unknown","02;02;29;08","02;02;49;03","You know, you can you can go back and change your preferences because of what you did. And typically the only that's all you got, you know, so maybe you just have to sort of run with it and you'll either resist dissipation or not Dean and then Dave, if you'd like a closing thought. Yeah. Mike So here's my closing thought."
"Unknown","02;02;51;04","02;03;12;21","So today we basically pulled out a material relationship on that slide. We built it in real time and we were making a comparison to the material quality of a city state. I think to bring it back to the paper, get back to the paper note I think this is really important because I actually support a lot of what what the what surveil wrote."
"Unknown","02;03;14;04","02;03;43;23","And I also believe that what we were talking about was material generative models out of that, there's a kind of a parallel to an iterative process. All right. So even even in the diagram that you have up here, this is kind of confirming iteration. So whether that iteration is in iterating, filling in a table versus it being blank, right?"
"Unknown","02;03;43;23","02;04;35;29","There's an iteration process or the city grew from 12 buildings to 1200 that's an iterative process or, or whatever. We've got multiple, multiple confirmations of the fact that at scale iteration is it is a thing, it's a material thing. Well, I'm going to go away from today's conversation because I don't know the answer to this but now I got to think about this is so when we, when we move away from those things that fall out, those there's capitulations that fall out in terms of skyscrapers and nine by nines from three by threes, do we trust the map where the blueprint where do we trust the process meaning critical path in the same material way?"
"Unknown","02;04;36;16","02;04;55;00","Because I think in the in the point one, as you said, Daniel, we're just talking about zero to one right now. But at some point we're going to have to get past one and get the real bootstrap and going. And then the question is, do we have to now incorporate something to get outside of scale free for that to make sense?"
"Unknown","02;04;55;00","02;05;18;12","And that's going to be my question to myself is do we materialize the trust in these models the same way as we materialize the model themselves? That's going to be my I'm going to go think about that for a few hours because that would burn a few neurons for sure. It'll go up in smoke. But thank you for this, because this was really helpful to me."
"Unknown","02;05;18;21","02;05;45;12","Incredibly helpful. Thanks. You know, when I was in Model Stream one with Ryan and Christopher and they were going through it. And so there are better people and will be better people to teach it and walk through it and there'll be a million ways to do it. So it's a funny thing that it happens in 33.2. A funny thing happened on the way to 33.3."
"Unknown","02;05;45;28","02;06;26;13","But yeah. Dave, any last comments? Yeah, the question of uncertainty over policy required means a lot of reflection and study. And I would suggest one thing to look at is what exactly is repression that's all I have to say for now. Yeah, yeah. OK, fellows, thank you very much. Congrats to those who have listened to the end and you're always welcome to participate in Active Lab."
"Unknown","02;06;26;27","02;06;31;09","So thanks again and peace out. Thanks stand by."
