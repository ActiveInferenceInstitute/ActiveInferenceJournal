"Unknown","00;00;33;12","00;01;01;17","Hello, everyone. Welcome to Acton Flab. Live stream number 33.0. It's November 18th. 2021. Welcome to the Active Lab, everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating and mute. If you're not going to be speaking. Thank you. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide."
"Unknown","00;01;02;26","00;01;30;10","This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so please provide us all with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here. We'll be following good video etiquette for live streams and respecting our awesome facilitator who blue. At this short link, you can find the streams past and upcoming and we are about to be heading into the second half of November."
"Unknown","00;01;30;10","00;01;56;07","20, 21. We're on the 23rd and the 30th we'll have to participatory group discussions on this very paper we're going to discuss today thinking like a state and then we have yet to set the December papers. So if you know someone who might be interested in joining or you yourself would like to discuss a paper of yours get in touch with us today in active stream 33.0."
"Unknown","00;01;56;20","00;02;20;07","The goal is to learn and discuss this paper thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deepest of our collective minds by Adele Glennon Kalu and the video like all dot zero videos, even though we do have the author here it's just an introduction to some of the ideas and how to pronounce them, not a review or a final word."
"Unknown","00;02;20;13","00;02;53;17","So we'll introduce ourself and then go into aims and claims, abstract and roadmap, keywords, figures and formalisms, et cetera. So let us know, especially if you'd like to participate in the upcoming 33.1 and 3.2 we'll start with just an introduction of saying hello and what we're excited to talk about or resolve either in the zero or in the upcoming group discussions and then will culminate with the author and transfer facilitation over."
"Unknown","00;02;53;29","00;03;23;16","So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I'm just excited to check in on the progress of this important topic. People have been theorizing about societies and cities and states and everything in between since as long as they were there, probably a little bit before. So it's just a fun topic and I'm really excited to see how active inference can give a new lens at resolving some of the long standing questions in that area."
"Unknown","00;03;24;03","00;04;09;26","I'll pass it to Steven Yeah. Thank you, Daniel. I'm Steven. I'm based in Toronto and I'm really interested in the multi scale implications of state and these construction, particularly for me because I'm interested in working around call social topographies, which is probably at the scale of events and moments in people's like lived experience and in their architectures and places so I'm really excited that this is bringing in this idea of state and larger scale, but also bridging that with active inference from the kind of faster, smaller scale."
"Unknown","00;04;09;26","00;04;37;11","So yeah, lots of good stuff here and lots of ontological questions as well, which I think is really cool and and I'll pass that over. Pass it over to Blue or. Yep, yep. Okay. So I'm blue, I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico and I really like this paper and I really like working and talking with Evo about ideas because these ideas are kind of at a bigger scale."
"Unknown","00;04;38;05","00;04;59;01","I am interested in self-assembly and things like at the cellular and maybe even subcellular level and like this takes it to the very big level. And I think that active inference really kind of unifies this. It's a skill free framework. And so that's kind of what I'm excited to talk about today. And maybe not resolve, but discuss and get some other perspectives on."
"Unknown","00;04;59;15","00;05;33;12","And I'll pass it to the first author of the paper or the only author of the paper. However, if you'd like to just introduce yourself say a few words so I'm aware of. So there's several over turning in cognitive science and physics, mainly interested in philosophy and things. What's relevant here is that somebody can help organize post research, participative citizens regulatory, which tries to understand how to navigate contemporary social, historical dynamics."
"Unknown","00;05;34;00","00;06;04;08","And part of this is to understand why we are states and how the states that we know have or lack so the goal of this paper is to basically understand how states have constructed and what it tells about their continued social identity through ideas and this, of course, the topic is big, so kind of states. But the very first thing we need to do is to understand what the state is and where it comes from."
"Unknown","00;06;04;08","00;06;32;20","And that's what I'm trying to do. That awesome. So moving on to the aims and things of the paper. So this paper is thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective mind. In the paper it states that the core argument of this article is that states can be and should be understood as hierarchical control systems, essentially similar in their core physical architecture to brains."
"Unknown","00;06;33;02","00;07;05;10","And we will leverage active inference to ground the study of intelligence in the way an organism maintains their structural autonomy to formally assess the collective brain hypothesis and the big question of the article is what kind of intelligence is displayed by city state systems and how is it embodied in their structure? So we'll go through the abstracts. Daniel, do you want to take the first section of the abstract?"
"Unknown","00;07;06;02","00;07;34;16","Yeah. Steven first would just one comment, just because I know you mentioned Kairos there and I've done an activity with the Kairos blank, it was like a mapping thing where you stand on parts of Canada and say, Look where it came from. So I'm going to connect. So I, I'm writing you. Kairos is working at that kind of regional national scale to look at questions around that."
"Unknown","00;07;34;16","00;07;41;15","And from what I hear, that's informing how your research is being approached. Is that correct?"
"Unknown","00;07;44;15","00;08;15;13","I did not understand the question of cross block at but correct. Yeah, it's an activity. It's an activity, actually. Not to do with the first and blanket literally where they put a big blanket around parts of Canada on the floor in a room and then people have to stand on it and they keep taking away bits which were basically which, which were not are no longer in the territories of the First Nations."
"Unknown","00;08;15;13","00;08;34;20","And then you see how much is left. There's not a lot left, so to speak. So it's talking to that idea of statehood and settlers and how much is left. And I wonder if that speaks to the wider work of Kairos and questions of states and how do we understand how we fit into that all? Maybe I'm I'm misunderstanding."
"Unknown","00;08;36;01","00;09;17;06","So that fits in the work of Kairos because it tries to bridge skills I never heard of this cross because this is not related to what we do doing a few minutes. It helps embody an impression of how well settlers have appropriated indigenous American territories. So this is something that's called it's the mandate of cross, but the core idea of cross is it's the great notion for tying three in Greek and cross is the instance, and it's contents actively like in some sense where you can seize opportunity."
"Unknown","00;09;17;25","00;09;40;24","And this is basically what's embedded agents do. They built kids and they build capabilities and they enact them. But when it's appropriate, this is the Gulf Coast to illustrate and reproduce. This contributed to and a lot of people have used to cross you have other kids that claim that are called cross. You have a Christian concept that is called cross."
"Unknown","00;09;40;24","00;10;01;02","You have a lot of people that make clear that this concept because it's very broad and it's very it's not something that has been reported in the Christian concept of times really in what we have today. So if you want to talk about this or use your gestures, the Greek word, which is cross. So, OK, yep. Just one thought."
"Unknown","00;10;01;02","00;10;32;04","Then I'll go to the abstract, which is that Kairos as opposed to Chronos, like a chronometer with decimal time. Kairos is like timelines us and it brings action and sort of a little bit of a moment that transcends the tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. So it's a cool term I'll read the first third of the abstract. This article aims to show how the deep history of early state societies entails the development of a collective form of cognitive agency."
"Unknown","00;10;32;27","00;11;07;24","It relates classical works in the anthropology of states, in particular Scots seeing like a state with the inactive account of biological and cognitive organization. Thanks to the Unified Ontology for Self-organization dynamics across scales offered by the active inference framework. Stephen, do you want to take the next piece of the abstract yes. OK, so active inference conceives of cognition as synchronization across individuated sensory motor states."
"Unknown","00;11;08;21","00;11;47;27","Entails that biological or socio cultural constraints display this minimal form of cognition by shaping the behavior of foster dynamics in a certain way. When such constraints collectively define a basic life form an integrated, operationally closed system they can therefore be said to embody adaptive knowledge properly speaking. And then I'll just say the last part, it says be an active inference account I articulate here strongly motivates and methodologically grounds a host, a holistic approach and the social sciences."
"Unknown","00;11;48;04","00;12;16;05","Indeed, it grounds the study of human societies in the role of structural constraints whose meaning depends both on the broader systems activity and in the historical context of their emergence. The peasant account of the dynamics of early urbanization and state. Genesis aims to illustrate this approach and a quick just walk through the roadmap of the paper. We're going to go through the introduction section, and then there are three main sections of the article."
"Unknown","00;12;16;07","00;12;47;23","The embodied intelligence in nested minds is the first. The second is the deep history of cities and states. The third from the urban metabolism to the collective mind. And then we'll go through that conclusion. And first up, in this zero contextualization video, we're going to discuss the key words, which I think there were no official keywords, but these are the words that I created for the paper when discussing it at the conference."
"Unknown","00;12;47;23","00;13;13;24","So we pulled out intelligence, autonomy, embodied intelligence, active inference, the free energy principle the concept of thinking through other minds. And we've done that in the stream before. Daniel, it's not true. I think we have right. And then niche construction. So I don't know. I don't have the facts on the on the exact number of the thinking through other minds stream, but we can find that out somewhere during this during this talk."
"Unknown","00;13;13;24","00;13;54;25","We'll look it up so I'll do you want to maybe speak to we'll give you the first stab at talking about what you mean by intelligence and autonomy. We've pulled a couple of quotes out of the paper, but maybe you'd like to say a few words. So if I remember well, intelligence achievement is actually it's the capacity to make links to connect the dots of data and to build on to that, you know, something a bit I don't want to commit to any specific notion of intelligence because I'm not aware of any meaningful first principle definition of it."
"Unknown","00;13;55;14","00;14;23;03","There is lots of work in measuring intelligence like IQ, which maps to specific cognitive abilities and us literally terrorism to generalize, to other life forms, instruments. And we could argue to other life forms in humans, in external capacities, the notion of autonomy is much more specific. It's important to know, OK, so etymological is one's ability to build one's own world."
"Unknown","00;14;23;03","00;14;48;25","So for example, if our city states have laws and the organs that makes the know are within these states, it is economics in the strictest sense. It is also recruited in the study of life and cognition and the way cognition is grounded in life by in activity scholars where it is related to the personal cluster and a precursor consensus."
"Unknown","00;14;49;08","00;15;26;17","So it is something that is an ability to operate at all, to recreate the conditions in which in which it operates. While there is no exogenous force that help him do so. For example, if you have a candle, it helps. There is a burning fire, which generates a floor for you then so as to invade self. But if someone does not keep you going, this dies so this is no really way to recreate the conditions in which it operates."
"Unknown","00;15;26;25","00;16;06;23","This is in contrast to the simplest bacteria there is, which is I go to look for it. So the active concept seeks to capture that nice. Daniel, do you maybe want to read the the quotes from the paper directly referring to intelligence and autonomy as described here? Intelligence is the general ability for a system to understand the world either in a reflexive propositional way or as enacted in their ecological activity and autonomy refers to the property of operational closure under precarious circumstance."
"Unknown","00;16;07;14","00;16;45;01","Each of the capability of biological systems to continuously maintain and recreate their own structural identity as a result of the collective activity of their constitutive processes. And these are processes that are actively generating and sustaining identity. And I think I've spoke really well to operational closure in the what you just described. But we just want to refer anybody who's listening to this paper by Mountville and Moscone in 2015, this biological organization, as a closure of constraints, as closure of constraints."
"Unknown","00;16;45;28","00;17;13;26","So I want to emphasize that there is I think it's pretty old, perhaps interesting because at least ten years and the only paper is an time to formalize it in logics. So it is not necessary in the reference on this, I don't remember what is the reference paper on this I thank you. Maybe let's move on to embodied intelligence."
"Unknown","00;17;13;26","00;17;45;00","And Stephen, if you this is perfect for you. Do you want to read the quote from the paper describing what embodied intelligence refers to? Yes, OK. And embodied intelligence refers to the ability for understanding adaptation, some sort of mixture of both that is imprinted in an agent's physical structure rather than in some general computational ability yeah, that's significant."
"Unknown","00;17;45;16","00;18;01;25","And then we have the wood lice alien. Yeah. Don't use the gesture FBI. You can use Cubase if you want a back channel but that's the wood lice example that Karl furnished and provided in the 2018 example. That's a little shout out there."
"Unknown","00;18;04;29","00;18;28;19","Awesome. Yeah. So the does anybody want to say a few more words that embodied intelligence? Maybe of ours, Steven? Or if there's something that comes up for you guys, feel free to raise your hand if there's something else you want to discuss. We and the slides are the sides that we've prepared about for the talk there in the Cubase shop as well."
"Unknown","00;18;32;13","00;19;00;27","So I mentioned just to say, I mean, because we're kind of introducing at this stage, I went about raising loads and loads of questions and we'll save that for the next one, brother. And I just note that this is useful just to highlight how this is being structured because you've got this word intelligence and embodiment. And I know in that there's talk about the brain or the idea of the brain and the idea of the mind."
"Unknown","00;19;01;28","00;19;38;09","So I think it's interesting here that this this paper sort of bridges a bit across the brain, intelligence, mind, culture, kind of area. So when it's talking here, it's kind of seen as quite an open description and is really making sure it's clear to speak to the difference to this general computational ability and that it's somehow a different type of knowing that's been done maybe with that word."
"Unknown","00;19;38;18","00;19;42;23","You know, morphological computing sometimes is used in that in that world."
"Unknown","00;19;45;24","00;20;17;20","I think you maybe. Daniel, do you want to explain the free energy principle and active inference sure. So as on the slide here, the free energy principle states that dynamical systems given sufficiently regular boundary conditions which are required for their continued existence, spontaneously self-organize so as to minimize their expected variation, free energy through time effectively maximizing evidence for the world model they enact."
"Unknown","00;20;18;06","00;20;57;10","So the expected variational free energy, which we talk about in more detail elsewhere, it's kind of like all aspects of the system through time are would have to be handled in order for persistence and using some technical formalisms that turns out to have equivalence with evidence for a generative model where one is persisting. Active inference explicitly brings action into that inference process, and it's the process by which dynamical systems maximize their evidence for the model of the world which they enact."
"Unknown","00;20;57;24","00;21;35;01","This can occur by a system altering its environment to fit expectations, i.e. niche modification action. So it's the difference between the free energy principle merely saying that persistent systems are going to be a isomorphic with those that have high evidence for the world model, which then act and then active inference as a corollary process theory says, and the way that they're going to do that is through inference updating their internal model or through action, which can be just sort of like a flock of birds action in the sky."
"Unknown","00;21;35;10","00;22;04;29","Or it can be niche modification, like stigma g nice. Thank you. And then we can go on to thinking, Oh, Stephen, you have a comment to say? Yeah, just one piece here. Also sort of flags up for me is the use the word model because we talk about their own model of the world and yet often we think of models as something that we've created in the world, you know, on a piece of paper and things like that."
"Unknown","00;22;05;14","00;22;38;28","So again, this is still runs a logical challenge in the sense that it is kind of like a self model, but it's, it's a self model that's not a representation so our language is kind of couched in our history. So anyway, I think that might be something that sort of resurfaces and I have to kind of keep restating because people might have this representational kind of inbuilt way of you know, those metaphors are quite embedded."
"Unknown","00;22;39;00","00;22;46;03","So it's hard for people to necessarily switch to what it means to move away from representational representational approaches."
"Unknown","00;22;49;05","00;23;26;18","I have one question as well. The reason why we're talking about active inference and free energy principle in this paper. So Ivo, what does active do for this paper? Are there other contender theories in the game? How else are people trying to take a unified approach to studying the specifics and the generalities of states OK, so the the approach that I define as an active inference with the and now between parentheses, it's simple."
"Unknown","00;23;26;25","00;24;10;08","It's between what is said by the activists and what they said that entrance theorists the core framework is adaptive. I'm interested in characterizing states state societies as an work of constraints. So as slow processes that are exist at a highest scale melts within individual, not between individual, but in some sense of our individual, and that shapes the activity of individuals so as to so that's the core argument touches our values of but not if I want to get there, I need some strong answers."
"Unknown","00;24;11;09","00;25;07;26","I if I need to get there, if I need to formalize the role of states which are accurate information, so much is in it. I need to formalize in a stronger sense the relation between public synchronization of organization and epistemic states. And that is precisely what active inference does. So I need the two. I need collective feminism the inactive approach, and I need a theme transformation to make the link between the ecological activity of states as an social process and the body, the constraints that actually consist that actually strategy is consist in yes."
"Unknown","00;25;07;27","00;25;08;13","Thank you."
"Unknown","00;25;10;16","00;25;46;13","We can, I guess, move on to thinking through other minds. Stephen, did you have a comment? Just one other comment as I was interested by the, you know, using the term constraints. So I and in active inference is sometimes thought of as the higher level processes are in some ways constraining the behavior of lower level processes rather than necessarily dictating them so that, you know, it's a little like I'm doing the faster jig and someone's just slow me down a little bit and so on."
"Unknown","00;25;46;13","00;26;24;10","So yeah, just curious that that word constraints is brought in. So often people think of, you know, intelligence is all about doing things and, you know, not constraining things. So, you know, I'm just curious about that. Yep. That's related to Synergetic Hearken, not Bucky and about like a wave in a ripple. Like the wave constrains where the ripple can go, the faster fluctuations are constrained by the slower ordering parameters so here we have thinking through other minds, and this is another body of work which you don't spend a ton of time on."
"Unknown","00;26;24;10","00;26;56;16","But for organisms that are making generative models of their niche, sometimes that niche contains other organisms such as their self. And it matters how those other organisms also include generative models of one's self. So thinking through other minds is describing how in a shared epistemic niche, shared informational niche with shared salience cues, for example, that two different agents are able to coordinate because they are thinking through each other's minds."
"Unknown","00;26;56;16","00;27;23;17","Like, if I put up my hand, then Blue will think that I want to speak. So it's sort of like a little bit of a theory of mind, but with more of a axiom flavor so both like the idea of constraint and this concept of thinking through other minds. Bring me back to Mike Levin's paper, the computation no boundary of the self because of of the nested like cognitive cones."
"Unknown","00;27;23;26","00;27;59;00","Right. And when he kind of talks about it, he talks about, you know, the higher order or like the larger level, the higher level organism or collective constrains the behavior of like the individual like sub level collectives. So that was kind of this idea of constraint. And then also like thinking through other minds, like specifically we talked about how connections between cells, individuals, but the connections that that essentially breed information sharing."
"Unknown","00;27;59;06","00;28;24;07","So when you have like a shared informational niche that enables this this process kind of of thinking through other minds where you think more as a collective. And so that expands the cognitive boundary of the self to then include other individuals within that cognitive boundary. Stephen Yeah, and that ties into the work of Andy Clark and the extended mind."
"Unknown","00;28;24;07","00;28;44;09","So there's a so the way that that gets there's a bit of talk about how do you think about that extension happening and how much is it an extension of the individual and how much I suppose is what's being talked about here is how much does what has been extended start to become its own sort of cognitive agent?"
"Unknown","00;28;45;06","00;29;17;19","So it's nice and maybe very appropriately able has returned. And we are moving on to talk about niche construction and I think a well might have a lot to say about the niche and its role in extending the cognitive boundary. So maybe you want to give us a few, a few insights into can we help us think through your mind modify the audio visual?"
"Unknown","00;29;17;21","00;30;01;26","That's what I could say about the me sorry, modify the audio visual niche of our joint attention. So there's no way for me to show a clip that works with this. I don't know it comes from your model of English. That's what I'm going to do, I think. I'm not trying to that to Booklist, whatever so the there is a body of work in biology, evolutionary biology, which is centered on how organisms modify their direct environment in a way that somehow fits their, their ecological needs."
"Unknown","00;30;02;11","00;30;36;17","So a typical example is how beavers will be. And I'm supposed to guess I mostly don't know what beavers gets out of it, but it get something. And the basic arguments in the thinking of the mind's framework is that the way humans furnish has a cognitive value. It's exercise expectations and by raising expectations, it allows expectations to synchronize between individuals."
"Unknown","00;30;37;15","00;31;15;26","And it's there is a very clear analogy or identity between once you accept there is a cognitive value in this conceptual as the notion of expectations, there is a very clear analogy and event, an identity between these conceptual and extreme conditions. Beaver are just extending the Commission, the expectations, the domain of the world that somehow participates to the fact that they live."
"Unknown","00;31;15;28","00;31;48;02","They keep on living and understanding their world. So there is a pretty basic way in which an organism can expand the extent of the world. The domain which is a person closed and which participates actively in their maintenance. And this is basically what's there is to be found in this whole section. So I think there needs to be some shapes there."
"Unknown","00;31;48;02","00;32;27;23","Well, they shape the condition, they shape their body and I'm not sure I'm trying to give actual insights in the initial section and how it's relates, but I'm not sure how relevant it is because I'm not sure what is the point that is to be made. The following then just that this construction is an important mechanism of extended cognition, like the recent stigma models show that individuals don't need to carry on board or internally the entire cognitive apparatus."
"Unknown","00;32;28;06","00;32;53;24","They only need to know how to interact and potentially modify a niche. And then also I think this is important when we're talking about cities and so on and states, because our niche can as per thinking through other minds include other others like us or distant from us, but also it includes the abiotic niche. So climate change and resource utilization, those are niche modifications."
"Unknown","00;32;54;02","00;33;19;03","There are some radioactive mountains that have been niche modified. And so it it provides a continuity between the kinds of ecological changes that humans make with the cognitive approach to ecosystems. And so that's why it's a very rich framework to build off. So I just want to read this quote from the paper really quick. And then and then Stephen will come to your comment."
"Unknown","00;33;19;03","00;33;51;27","So it says as stated previously, the network has constraints. Defining the structural identity of basic life needs not be printed in flesh. It only needs to influence faster processes so as to continually recreate itself. And the references for this are there on this slides if you care to probe further. It says such constraints can be embedded in the informationally rich sociocultural niche, which enables a human ecology by affording adaptive coordination and the development of complex skills."
"Unknown","00;33;52;06","00;34;25;05","And I think one of the the main things that this paper does and of feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but it kind of takes the idea of cumulative cultural evolution and brings the niche into this as a cognitive extension. So I think that's one of the key moves made here. Basically, I know this revolution. I have known evolution for like five years or so, actually insurance for one year only."
"Unknown","00;34;25;05","00;34;54;02","So interrelationship. So I see things and I'm currently writing a paper on the lack of integrated reductionism and because your evolution and the fact is cumulative culture evolution solution is the replacement of low fitness variance by high fitness variance within variance, I mean of control tokens that are implemented within mind or behavior because there is not a strong ontology on what the replicator is in control or evolution."
"Unknown","00;34;55;08","00;35;26;23","And it can cite a world to convey is that culture does not something the brain culture does not certainly does not stop in individuated controlled accounts. And well, the goal of the paper is to show that social work is revolution. It does not list extension or intention. I don't know it does. It exists not only within the minds of individual and within the verbal effects of culture."
"Unknown","00;35;26;23","00;35;44;00","And so can it exists in structures that are not a currency ball and individual and that are not entailed by any specific control. It can hence the holism. Thanks. Thank you, Steven."
"Unknown","00;35;46;20","00;36;10;24","You are also bringing that be for example, is to some extent a beaver constructed them and to some extent maybe it grows at them and maybe in the same, you know. So by adding pieces it is growing something a bit. And at what point does it stand back and say, oh, that move that one a bit to the left, move that a little bit to the right and sort of improve the construction?"
"Unknown","00;36;10;24","00;36;38;25","And how much is it an evolving process? I suppose there's also that idea that once something has grown and it's changed the niche, something else, you know, just like the brain effectively has to grow before it can do its thinking. So maybe there's something about how these structures have grown and been constructed. So I don't know, I don't I'm just mentioning that awesome."
"Unknown","00;36;38;25","00;37;10;24","Thank you. I guess maybe we kind of got ahead of ourselves talking about niche modification and cultural evolution I love this picture because it really shows like kind of how much we have offloaded our cognitive selves into the niche environment. Like we don't need to know how to use directions or what restaurants are good, or we don't need to know actually any of that anymore because it's all like riding around with us in a smart phone in our pocket all the time."
"Unknown","00;37;11;17","00;37;33;15","So we've just put our brain, we've offloaded all of the cognitive capacity of our brain, or at least a good portion of it. So what do we think about now that makes me think about that? Always. It says in the paper, we claim that niche modification is critical for cumulative cultural evolution, and advancements such as writing allow active inference to occur between agents and stigmas."
"Unknown","00;37;33;15","00;38;05;03","Accused embedded in the niche of the device. So what you did, I wrote what you just said OK, which I wanted to note is that what's described the way we offload information on our social and environmental and technological requirements is the classical collective brain picture, which is entailed by mostly by data and so on. And how many of you like to control evolution?"
"Unknown","00;38;06;07","00;38;30;26","What I want to show is that to go a step beyond we do not only have a self that's cemented by environmental cues, there is a self outside ourselves. There is things that shape social life and that are not the agency that shape social life, and that is not human, that is institutional. So that's the step beyond the collective brain."
"Unknown","00;38;30;26","00;38;59;10","We've all got a collective brain view which is maybe a noted collective brain. There is actually such a thing as a collective brain. Stocks animates and we can study it well, we can study it now. So Wikipedia and the Internet are network of the collective brain. Stephen Yeah, it's interesting as well. In terms of we have all this extended information, but there's this there's a very good book called The Paradox of Choice."
"Unknown","00;38;59;28","00;39;17;16","So the the thing is we have all this information, but you still have to do an action policy on what to do. And the challenge is you can have so many, you know, it's like going to the supermarket and, you know, you can buy 50 different types of olive oil. It's just olive oil at the end of the day."
"Unknown","00;39;17;17","00;39;41;16","And now you've got to choose between 50 and you got, you know, so there's, there's a sense of abundance, but there's also a need for an action policy, which is of course what active influence talks about. And ultimately it's not the volume of information that's going to be the game. It's the ability to act and in appropriate ways and make sense of how to be in your niche."
"Unknown","00;39;41;17","00;40;09;26","So that's kind of interesting awesome. Thank you. So we are going to move on. We're going to go into the next section embodied intelligence in nested minds. But but just to quickly summarize here, like what was the main part up in the introduction? So we've gone through the keywords, but just to clearly just state it out, autonomous systems are defined by a set of processes that create and sustain their identity."
"Unknown","00;40;10;10","00;40;39;05","They embody their understanding and adaptive abilities within their physical structure. They enact a model of their world and seek to maximize evidence for this model through active inference. And they can maximize model evidence through modification of their niche. So just to kind of sum up what an autonomous system is and where we are at this point, and then we'll move on to discussing embodied intelligence in nested minds."
"Unknown","00;40;40;09","00;41;04;20","So a quote from the paper, it says, Here we argue that innovations are instead an emergent property of our species, cultural learning abilities applied within our societies and social networks, our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, how many human brains which evolve primarily for the acquisition of culture together. Get a collective brain."
"Unknown","00;41;04;20","00;41;28;14","Oh, this isn't actually from some of the thinking, like CTE, for this is from the innovation in the collective brain paper. And this framework, this collective brain framework sounds the study of intelligence in the way that an organism maintains structural autonomy and allows the formal assessment of the collective brain hypothesis. So the collective brain hypothesis has been put forward but not formally assessed up until this point."
"Unknown","00;41;28;22","00;41;59;20","I thought. You want to talk a little bit more about that because I probably just botched it about how the collective brain this is not fully assessed. Yeah. So in cultural evolution you have what I'd say is the dominant theory is John Evolution. Jenkins you're quite a version theory, which is basically centered on how we have cultural variance, that type of adaptive role."
"Unknown","00;42;00;02","00;42;48;06","And there are a set of cognitive bias or cognitive mechanism, actually cognitive biases, personal bias exponentially that help us identify what are the most adaptive cultural violence. And these have feedback effect on gene selection, which has come to our collection. And basically all of repetition is internal by process of cognition process between a genetic and cultural evolutionary information processes and the fact is there are claims, there are numerous claims in the literature that there is some sort of collective computation that unified our collective cognition with something by this."
"Unknown","00;42;48;15","00;43;33;19","So there is, if I remember well, Henry Schmidt, a Christof who was the intellectual in the Greater Green Paper, and there is, I think both and you know, both, which is basically one of the two funder of the initial formalism and smudging, which is one of the most competitive, is suddenly a member of the current literature that's wrote a paper on collective cognition, no collective distributed computation because revolution has just been complacent and the exact title, but it's I won't respond to each of its words why there have a model of if no bias in selection and they have a narrative interpretation of this somehow entailing some kind of contention."
"Unknown","00;43;33;28","00;44;06;22","And there is nothing in between. There is a few paper of less interactors that's kind of interesting. The convolutional through networks and you will variance accents without calling them. There is literally not one paper that explains how is this supposed to be cognition? What are the mechanisms? What is the cognitive architecture? There is nothing right or it's marginal and I did not of it."
"Unknown","00;44;07;17","00;44;36;15","And the goal of the paper is to basically explain how we can grant of you upgrade to mechanisms that are introduced by the social control networks and structural constraints that are embedded with our society. But that's it's not a model because to be able to focus on model of any brain or organism is not tractable. But it's to prove that it's meaningful."
"Unknown","00;44;37;01","00;45;03;07","It's there is positive way in which we can model societies, us or at least process within societies as a collective form of cognition. And a key example of this is the states, because we have access to the mechanisms we have access to different papers with which they understand and predict and control awesome. That's a perfect, I think, transition into the next slide."
"Unknown","00;45;03;21","00;45;39;08","Do you want to read this for us, Daniel? This paper uses the framework described to illustrate that the co-evolution of top down control and cultural deconstruction construction enabled the emergence of the city state complex and how these collective organizations maintain structural autonomy awesome. Thank you. And so that's kind of the summary I say of the of the section, the embodied intelligence and nested minds, section sections."
"Unknown","00;45;39;08","00;46;07;06","Anybody want to give a thought? Or we can go on to the next section. Just what you just said about how we know the mechanism level of the state I'm thinking we see it's neurotransmitters and it's action selection policies. So it's like every system has advantages and disadvantages for it study. This is one where many of the key features are designed."
"Unknown","00;46;07;14","00;46;30;29","And so it's a lot more like investigating the connections of a program that was written rather than the potentially like MAP Territory debates over like, well, what is the bacteria really doing? Are we really measuring the bacteria but it's like we know how certain processes in the state happen, but not all of them. And citizens usually don't know seven yeah."
"Unknown","00;46;30;29","00;47;15;15","So following on to what Daniel said in a quick question, in a way is how much you may be trying to have a sort of a realist approach on the idea of the brain or being a brain or how how much is an instrumental tool or a metaphor? So be curious as you take that correlation because you got brain, you've got mind, you've got intelligence, you've got extensive cognition, what is it that you are really wanting to make it say is like a brain that's kind of an enact in its own action policies or so that would be that might be helpful."
"Unknown","00;47;16;23","00;47;35;00","So I think actually, like maybe we should hold that to the end section from the from the because I think we're going to get more into how is a city like a brain as we get closer to the end of this contextualization we'll say for dot one and two because we'll cover just the background here. But it's a very good question."
"Unknown","00;47;35;23","00;47;56;18","Yeah, so very good. It's going to provoke a lot of discussion. So that's why I'm like well, maybe we should get through the rest of the rest of the the talk going on first. So it is so we're moving on now. To the deep history of cities and states. Here is another quote from the paper. Do you want to read this for us?"
"Unknown","00;48;01;06","00;48;22;05","Yes. OK, cultural niche construction allowed humans to alter their social cognitive ecology in a way that allowed extensive functional specialization and the evolution of supra individual agency through mediating institutions."
"Unknown","00;48;26;03","00;48;53;25","That makes me think about the evolution of functional specialization in ants colonies. And it's like you can't have the super specialized task. You know, you can't have somebody who specializes on just sour dough bread until there's somebody else who can help them with some other tasks. And that's the economic inspiration for why they call that process in ants division of labor downstream of Adam Smith."
"Unknown","00;48;53;25","00;49;20;26","1776 the economic division of labor and the cabinet maker and the shoemaker and all of that. So once you have a lot of people living together, they can specialize in a new way. There are new institutions mediate needed to mediate, and that results in more being different. I love how Daniel says ants and gets like giddy and excited as student and I notice this term supra individual."
"Unknown","00;49;21;00","00;49;53;16","So there's kind of this, I suppose in the end colony think of the Queen. But in our world we have these and actually I've been thinking about this myself in terms of how we relate to these bigger scales. So this idea of a supra individual or supra collective it ties into the idea of the state, you know, because, you know, we think of, you know, the word state is actually used literally in the United States to be, you know, a region."
"Unknown","00;49;54;00","00;50;20;11","But there is an idea that it's trying to maintain something. So that term I think is a, is a useful one to sort of put out and, and that is a super individual agency. So that ties into active influence in, in an interesting way. I would be interested to know the term social cognitive ecology. It's not one I've heard before in quite that way."
"Unknown","00;50;20;23","00;50;39;17","So I don't if that could be something just to just to maybe ground that term in this context. Well, we can return to it and I added the book cover for Leviathan with the person made up of other people Awesome. Thank you."
"Unknown","00;50;42;01","00;51;29;16","So in this section of the paper available explains how state Michigan based construction depended on cereal monoculture the technology of writing material infrastructure, dense settlement, dense settlements and engineering societies from the top down, as documented in seeing like escape seem like a state by Scott. I felt you have a few maybe words to say about this. I mean, more than the brief kind of overview I just gave so I'm not sure I identified the key subject, like on the importance on the morphogenesis of the states from a social scientific perspective."
"Unknown","00;51;32;04","00;52;05;14","Just just talking about state needs construction. Like what what did that depend on all of the things most clear states is, I think we don't have a lot of definitions there. So it I think it's OK it is said in certain cities that it is essentially a monopoly on legitimate violence. So if there is a group of men, not those weapons and that those the exclusive rights to use it and that these right."
"Unknown","00;52;05;14","00;52;39;09","Is probably accepted it is a state I'm most interested in the mode of operation of a state. So for me it's a chain of command. It's let me see if systems that's makes people do things. So this goes to definitions that entail the loss of human autonomy. Then tell that you are at least a subset of humans that are constrained to follow the laws."
"Unknown","00;52;39;09","00;53;24;15","Laws that are experts in creating posts. So that's in clear deviation from what is done, say, in Iroquois society. Where at least by the person I say mostly no one has the power to coerce anyone else and any decision is grounded on rational debate. So this is not what the state is like. A state is white and you have a guy with the biggest bird and you can say, OK, you go kill this person because I want to I want this weapon and you are the definition of the states that submit."
"Unknown","00;53;25;16","00;54;17;21","You have definition of the state that is grounded in the so great. I'm not sure when it is. It's I think it's with Leviathan, which I did not read. But it doesn't tell you that the state is a central actor that that's power on anyone, which is sort of a Chuck's things. So a state is something that has power on anyone and it's not tied to a specific individual so that entails the capability for a set of power institution or a set of individual to basically coerce other people to things and this entail, for example, a not at least in our country, possession of resources for other people to flee or in North imbalance in"
"Unknown","00;54;17;22","00;54;44;05","world for other people to get to you. Even so, they know it will strip them of their autonomy. So it's a very running on which they try to project. It's right here on the states and state emergence is written, and these entities are required to trade a lot of ways for basically wealth to be centralized and powerful people to be able to constrain everyone else awesome."
"Unknown","00;54;44;05","00;55;25;27","And that speaks very well to how the states get a grip on their subjects and themselves. And what is the common grounding maybe that is used to get like to get a heterogeneous understanding of states sorry, emergency alert your attention, please your attention. Please update in action policy requested from the state exactly. Exactly. So so now states get a grip on us through like our our cognitive offloading into the nation."
"Unknown","00;55;25;27","00;55;45;25","Right student you want to say something? Yeah. I mean, this also speaks to that challenge of being able to get a grip on things which are beyond the adjacent scale like that. You know, they're trying to get, you know, after you use that, these technologies can reach out to everyone. But at the same time, it's kind of they can't easily get a grip."
"Unknown","00;55;47;04","00;56;15;02","So there's some interesting points there around, you know, because there's a few scales between us and the state. Right. Um, and that's, that's interesting. And technological developments like little tiny chips that track where you move, that makes it a little easier to get a grip on where somebody is moving. So it's a co-evolution with the states and technology going back to agriculture and writing and ledgers."
"Unknown","00;56;15;02","00;56;46;29","And now we're in a new phase of ledgers from 01 to three next step. Yeah. And of course, the challenge is that they get a grip on what you're doing, but that inference is about why you're doing it decontextualized so they think someone's doing X or Y, and that may be wildly different you know, they may be underestimating the risk or they may be radically overestimating the risk of behavior."
"Unknown","00;56;48;17","00;57;19;05","Awesome. So I'm going to just flip through these next few slides. So dense settlements, the what the function of the Dan settlement did was allowed for economic codependency and we talked earlier about the functional specialization that was like, you know, necessary for this economic codependency. And it also facilitated the development of nested social communities and generative center scaling relationship here."
"Unknown","00;57;19;05","00;57;45;29","And I think we have to wait and address that maybe in the in the DART one and moving on that says enforcing state control over urban systems mandates, building acceptance into the population. And this is like how do you let the state be in charge of you? How do you grant grip to the state? And this is the people must perceive competency in the authoritarian regime."
"Unknown","00;57;45;29","00;58;21;06","And there's a redistribution of wealth, like, for example, paying taxes and also symbolic legitimacy, which is achieved through the church largely. Or maybe maybe there's other ways. But but was in the in the early development of cities and states, largely religious based. So what there's a lot of things that we've talked about. So that tie into formation of cities and states and it's large scale coordination, collective identity, crop redistribution, which I thought was interesting."
"Unknown","00;58;21;06","00;58;44;27","Like some people grow it, some people eat it, some people take it, some people sell it. And then the functional specialization, specialized roles and the control of the money and the flow of the money so all these things together unify to give a state grip and allow this kind of top down control and is there any comments on that?"
"Unknown","00;58;44;27","00;59;16;03","Or if not, we can move on to the next section, just that if those are the necessary and sufficient features when there's a crisis of competency or distribution of wealth or symbolic legitimacy, what does that for Bode well? Do you have an answer? I'm sure waiting and waiting in the wings? Yes, the answer is basically a circular circular demographic theory, which is a central set."
"Unknown","00;59;16;03","01;00;10;22","Results include ethics, which basically states are for the possibility for the elites to ignore the social maintenance and just capture wealth. And when they do too much, it causes political instabilities. So and this entail fluctuating things, cycles of integration and distraction in states developments. And by the way, we in the sense of France, the US and likely global capitalism are in the phase of disintegration, which means which can tell us that we have to understand how to organize outside or in spite of dominant situation and to understand where they come from cool."
"Unknown","01;00;11;08","01;00;36;04","So we're going to move into the last section of the paper, which is from the urban metabolism to the collective mind and we're going to go back to the main question of the article, which was what kind of intelligence is displayed by city state systems and how is it embodied within their structure? And maybe, Stephen, do you want to read this quote from the paper?"
"Unknown","01;00;37;21","01;01;07;16","Yes, OK, so answering this question in terms of inactive inference entails revisiting our accounts of the urbanization dynamics as the results of cities, state systems actively managing to get a grip on their world, i.e. minimize their expected variation of free energy cool. And there are a couple of more quotes from this section that we can move on to."
"Unknown","01;01;08;08","01;01;51;27","Daniel, do want to read this first one here? Basic autonomy is indeed formally defined as operational closure or more precisely, the capability of a network of constraints to catalyze faster processes like metabolic flows into maintaining and recreating itself. I like that's kind of a twist on the continental organism concept, the teleological definition. The organism is like the level it makes sense at, and this takes a more operational and mechanistic approach towards closure of mechanism and constraints and other forces rather than merely and directness, which doesn't immediately suggest a mechanism."
"Unknown","01;01;52;20","01;02;20;13","And then since the material and sociocultural landscapes of urban systems catalyze human activities so as to maintain itself the process of urbanization clearly entails the constitution of cities. As basic life food comes in, waste goes out city's life. Awesome. And I love this picture of like the elephant is the city of to want to say something or to point out."
"Unknown","01;02;20;13","01;03;07;19","That's the first point you made is that the amount of land must show the financial or my account of them is a twist on the concern idea that this is the level at which it makes sense and it's basically the movement that's going to be around mushroom and more intimate because in activism at first it's surrounded in conceptual philosophy, in phenomenology, that's this is the grounding in which a very now and maybe much right I'm not sure articulated the view that cognition is in fact running the life and while it's mostly people and the best center for life sciences I think it's called try to do is to mechanize it's to exercise it to grind"
"Unknown","01;03;07;19","01;03;42;03","it into specific chemical biochemical processes. So it's precisely captured what peace accords is meant to do awesome and good job in saying Daniel based on based on the stigma cues left in the knees and we can move on to a couple more quotes from the paper. This is one that really resonated with me and it's paraphrasing Jay Blanka and Lam and 26."
"Unknown","01;03;42;03","01;04;21;08","This paper that's here, the evolution of information in the major transitions says a full fledged evolutionary transition typically entails the emergence of new forms of information systems, mediating regulation at the collective level and or the heritability of collective traits and then another quote from the paper is also taken from this Gaussian call paper in 2014. It says The emergence of city states with their professional classes and their mediating institutions based on writing technology is constitute a clear case of such a transition, especially in the case of the late agricultural civilizations."
"Unknown","01;04;21;18","01;04;49;04","And I totally get this and also it really speaks to how stigma J'accuse left in the niche environment it can can contribute to the formation of our collective brain. I mean writing like we can leave stigma educators for generations yet to follow and some writing in stone like so this is like still we can read it many, many, many, many ages and generations later, which I thought that was really poignant."
"Unknown","01;04;49;10","01;05;25;21","Steven. Yeah, one thing I'll be interested in terms of the state is how much different areas of society or the states are trying to achieve similar types of outcome so when there's, and when there's and we, we've just had that case of that video of a court has been murdered and so like within the state, you have internal conflicts, you know, within within the state itself."
"Unknown","01;05;26;04","01;05;50;02","But also, how much does the people, the different scales have to be aligned or how much will the state itself kind of do? What states do, so to speak, has its own mind Awesome. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, I agree about not every single action in a state necessarily being the same. Like if you looked at the body, you said, well, no, we're supposed to be making glucose."
"Unknown","01;05;50;02","01;06;24;09","Why are there cells that are breaking it down? Or like there can be sections that are doing processes that seem directly opposite to each other, but that can be part of a broader regulatory process. So it brings into question, you know, what are the official processes versus the things that are in the gray zone of the state and how do we go from this model into more useful forms nice things."
"Unknown","01;06;25;05","01;06;55;17","And so we can move now to another quote from the paper that is from paraphrasing this paper that we actually just did in a recent livestream, How to Count Biological Minds by a massive sense. And in in the thinking like a state paper it says, if the nested hierarchy of regulation systems enables adaptive behavior at the system scale, it effectively enacts a collective mind regardless of whether system components retain their cognitive ability."
"Unknown","01;06;56;17","01;07;24;25","And this speaks back to what we were saying earlier about the top level kind of constraining the lower levels. Like maybe there's like a once you contribute to the collective, then, you know, you've contributed to something greater than yourself. And your own cognitive ability perhaps doesn't matter so much any thoughts on that? Or we can move on to some more topics from the paper."
"Unknown","01;07;25;23","01;08;00;29","Daniel, do you want to read this quote? The closest analog of our intuitive picture of a mind in urban systems is their most disembodied mechanism for adaptive regulation administration. Indeed, just like neuronal cognition, it entails the top down regulation by a specialized population with the help of a specific purpose information system makes me think about those tubes that they use to put the physical packages in, send them and now there are special information channels, but you better be listening when that channel calls."
"Unknown","01;08;02;26","01;08;23;15","So that's like Futurama. Like they have like I mean, the bureaucracy like the administration and I mean administration. I love this quote from the paper. I do think like administration is totally like disembodied from like reality and bureaucracy is like so imposing. But like in the Futurama, they all have like, you know, it's like space age, modern transmission."
"Unknown","01;08;23;21","01;08;49;26","Like you could just click DocuSign on the Internet and like get they're using like tubes literally like to send the things off and it takes seven years to get approval or something ridiculous like that. But like, it does work like that, right? Bureaucracy is, is kind of crazy. This next quote says, The institution of state sponsored legal codes affords a way to directly transcribe administrative expectations into individual minds."
"Unknown","01;08;50;06","01;09;14;00","Rule of law is therefore a core tool by which states create the world through building the basis of their own intelligent behavior into their socio cultural niche. And this is brilliant, right? Like just yesterday, my landlord called the codes officer because my neighbors have weeds, right? Like, I know they're not allowed to have weeds. It's beyond the expectation of like, you know, our neighborhood that nobody has weeds."
"Unknown","01;09;14;05","01;09;38;06","And everyone knows that this is the expectation. Some people don't maintain the weeds, and we all have the right and duty and obligation to, you know, impose that on our needs environment. Daniel. So the expectations, the normative expectations, a lot of laws are like, you know, it shall be within two weeks after this giving notice that this happens."
"Unknown","01;09;38;06","01;10;07;25","So their expectations and then they're called codes. And so maybe think about predictive coding and it's like we can predict that this technology is going to be used this way. So I know it's not exactly what people mean with the neural rate codes, et cetera, with predictive processing, predictive coding. But laws are normative. They're saying what should happen and that helps behave as expected you want to be on the right side of the road driving in the US."
"Unknown","01;10;08;02","01;10;33;29","So that's like an expectation. And then it becomes an intersubjective preference that is sponsored by the state. So it just kind of cool again, showing points of contact between people's day to day life and their intuitive explanations for how these systems work. And then it's like, yes, we have an ontology that picks up right with you and then goes a little further than you might have expected to."
"Unknown","01;10;35;20","01;11;18;10","Awesome. So yes, that's exactly the idea. Knows on the actualization of expectations, the fact that they are normative is I think incidental actually until it's a phenomenon to their core role, which is to shape behavior. You are the project in your study that was all you call that, which is called, I think much should be the are oh my goodness or some closely associated population which has a behavioral approach to about and we need to do that more yeah."
"Unknown","01;11;18;21","01;11;56;20","Sounds good. So you just have some summary quotes maybe from the paper and that kind of summarizes the ideas that were presented here. Daniel, do you want to read one or some of these OK, I'm just picking which one I would want to read. I think the second one is a lot like what we were just talking about with the state defining expectations and then modifying its own niche, that operational closure to implement those expectations lest it dissolve then I like this top quote."
"Unknown","01;11;56;20","01;12;19;19","Our notion of intelligence is based upon active inference, a skill free framework applying to any system with individuated boundary states. And then it's like even the word state is a pun. As I've pointed out before, it's not being state in French. And we talk about internal external blanket states, boundary states, that sounds like it's going to be at the boundary of the empire."
"Unknown","01;12;20;10","01;12;46;06","And then this is what it looks like to apply active efforts to a real system, to go from a sort of Bayesian graph boundary notion to being like, well, what if that boundary states country was intermediating and insulating between these other two? So like how even the word state comes into play? I like that. I really like that too."
"Unknown","01;12;46;06","01;13;14;15","And I like that that that's kind of a play on like the first in particular physics, like specific particular physics, but also like physics as related to a particle and the idea of a state. Actually, something when I was proofreading this paper was like, you know, I know that you're talking about like city states, but it's not immediately obvious to the reader that like you might want to say like city states to kind of flesh that out like from the get go because it is it can be such a play on words, right?"
"Unknown","01;13;14;21","01;13;42;12","It's a boundary state, it's a blanket state, it's an active state. It's a city state. Daniel, maybe one other thing we can talk about in the dot one or two is states as we know them are new. And so it's only been a few generations like your great great great grandparents. That's a long time ago. It's a lot of tacos ago, but it's a blink of the eye in terms of evolution and in terms of deep history."
"Unknown","01;13;42;27","01;14;12;23","And so even Pre Westphalia, that was not so long ago and there's so many world traditions. And so just realizing that we're in a very non stationary moment with the development and the implementation of states, it's really important because it can be easy to be like, Oh, it's a grind. All the states in the U.N. and you know, 50 states in the US, it's like even 70 years ago there weren't that many states in the US and there was different countries in the world so things are changing."
"Unknown","01;14;12;23","01;14;46;03","It just sometimes it's at a different time scale, which makes sense because they're bigger and slower entities than we are civil I want to point out two things. First, the pun is not intended, but no, I would extremities and no one will check the second is that we received news that states emerged with agriculture. It is what got the Acropolis said in the paper I cited, which is not accurate or we don't know whether it's accurate."
"Unknown","01;14;46;10","01;15;16;06","You have a pretty good saying review of the literature of the dimensions. And the fact is we do not know what human societies were like before written story. We do not know. So I and most importantly, it's something grabber the Wingrove two apologies to the historical, but as you like to write about the kinds of organization that are authoritarian, that are kinds of positions that are not."
"Unknown","01;15;16;18","01;16;02;09","So even if we are signs of three, 12 states or anything, we don't know whether those kind of organization like what we know today because Western nation states are extreme in kind of executive and coercive behavior. They are shaped by war within Europe and between Europe and coming up colonialist countries. So I prefer I much prefer to grow the history in which I talk in European history in modern history, after Westphalia, after the birth, or in the roots of the birth of the nation states, because it's pretty hard to talk about the roots of Sumerian states."
"Unknown","01;16;02;18","01;16;29;29","We need to also. So because those are states we need to. So if we want to talk about what states are, but if you want to talk about what our states are, we need to go in West whatever we do, not to go in Samarra or Egypt or whatever so just to kind of play off of that extractive and corrosive behavior and that states are often born out of war something that you mention in the paper."
"Unknown","01;16;30;01","01;16;54;01","But I don't think maybe it gets enough attention is the concept of shared identity because in this shared identity, that's what makes us faction us into our own state. We're going to divide and become something new. And Daniel was saying how we have so many states now, so many more states than we've ever had before, and this like factionalism, and we all have like this distinct identity."
"Unknown","01;16;54;09","01;17;26;16","Is this going to breed more war or is every state going to become so small because they'll just faction and keep dividing? I mean, you can get something the most homogenous human culture you can imagine. And they will find something to divide them. So. So is this good? Is it bad if we keep dividing? Is it going to be like a homogenous, like bunch of sub factions or is it just going to lead to like more division and more war if I discuss that, it would take a lot of time."
"Unknown","01;17;27;19","01;18;08;08","I understood this session was, yeah, we are much off track, definitely like some of the stuff there, but we'll save it for that, that one. OK, so moving on. The left of my mind does not directly emerge from into individual interactions, but from slower evolving dynamical constraints with supervision on the do not reduce to human activity. Therefore, the proper skills analysis of collective cognition is an integrated activity of entire urban systems and should more specifically be grounded in the broader processes by which they maintain and reproduce their structural identity."
"Unknown","01;18;08;17","01;18;37;05","Understood as an operationally closed set of constraints underlying the metabolic, cognitive and ecological activity. You know, replace urban with brain body just you can say the same exact thing. The brain the body have to be an integrated unit finally blue. What does it mean to think like a state? I'm going to put your overlay over the video so it'll look like your state."
"Unknown","01;18;37;06","01;19;07;13","Go for it. The cognitive activity of states is defined mechanically by the standardized administrative systems they use to understand and manipulate their world and functionally by their drive to build and enact grip over the material and sociocultural needs so there it is. The question, the answer we made it through from to agency and I like it's not what is it like to be a state it's not the Nagle 54."
"Unknown","01;19;07;13","01;19;36;02","What is it like to be a bat? This is more of a cognitive test interpretation that helps us actually potentially find useful ways. You know like I don't want to do you know in X country you grip the state people can kind of write their own jokes on that theme nice. And we can just think about what maybe these questions lead to."
"Unknown","01;19;36;03","01;20;01;27","Maybe what a good understanding of this work might enable I've mentioned earlier the necessity for this understanding because of the kind of divide, divided space that we're in right now. What are the next steps for the SNP and active in France? What are the goals? What are you so curious about? If you want to participate in either of the discussion videos, get in touch with us."
"Unknown","01;20;01;27","01;20;32;03","We would love to have you on to talk about these ideas in more detail. Do you guys have any closing thoughts yeah, just in Diet one. Let's dove in and open some threads. Take some notes in that too. Let's see where we go. Maybe somebody would like to pick up on one of those threads or apply one of these ideas and say, Oh, I was working on a history of my region, and so I want to see how I can apply that."
"Unknown","01;20;32;16","01;21;02;08","So we applied active inference to get thinking like a state. And then how do we apply thinking like a state for something else? Whatever it is that somebody is interested in seeing a well, thank you for coming and kind of guiding us through our contextualization video. It's always a pleasure. Do you want to have the final word I don't know if there's anything smart to say."
"Unknown","01;21;02;08","01;21;26;28","So, yes, but these are the words the paper does speak for itself quite brilliantly. I will say all right. Authors who come on dates are the best. No, it's all good. Thanks for joining blue and facilitating. See leaders of all. And thanks also to Stephen so hope to see you all in the dark one what that ought to or beyond."
"Unknown","01;21;27;03","01;21;29;02","So bye bye."
