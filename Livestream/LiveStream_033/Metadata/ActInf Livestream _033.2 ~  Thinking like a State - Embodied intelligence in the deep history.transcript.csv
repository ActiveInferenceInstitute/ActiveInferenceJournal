"Speaker 1","00;00;35;15","00;01;03;11","Hello and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining. It's November 30th 20, 21 and we're in active live stream number 33.2 on thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds. This is the second discussion we've had on this paper and if you're watching a long live definitely ask us questions because it'll help us have a fun feedback and a discussion."
"Speaker 1","00;01;05;01","00;01;33;07","Welcome to Active Inference Lab. We are participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams it's a new slide."
"Speaker 1","00;01;33;17","00;02;04;16","The short link is gone. It's been deprecated thanks to the work of many awesome active lab participants and especially Jessica B, we have moved over our live stream past an upcoming database to a coder site. So you can go to this code site or maybe somebody can post the link. And this is an interactive way for you to look at the date video, the title, the number, the guests that were on the stream, the keywords, all the links."
"Speaker 1","00;02;05;00","00;02;25;24","This is linked up with our knowledge management as well as our people management CRM as they call it. So this is an awesome tool that we're using with Kota and hopefully it improves the find ability and the index ability so that if you're looking for some keyword, you can find all the live streams where we discuss that keyword."
"Speaker 1","00;02;25;24","00;02;35;09","Or if you have somebody who you like to listen to, then you can find them in the guests or the participants section and you can hear what they had to say about a certain topic at a certain time."
"Speaker 1","00;02;37;13","00;03;19;00","Today in Active Stream 33.2, we're going to be having our dot to jump off slash speculate onwards and upwards. Discussion on the paper by Oflc would include thinking like a state embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds. So we'll just have fun. We have some topics from last time that we put on a slide for 33.2 that we can talk a little bit through as always, things come up and it'd be great to have anyone's questions in the live chat, otherwise we're just going to be chilling and talking about this cool paper."
"Speaker 1","00;03;19;19","00;03;38;02","So we will start with introductions and then just take it from there. I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll save my specific excitements or what I'd like to or remembered about the paper for our kind of intro round and I'll pass to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;03;40;03","00;04;01;04","I am Dean, I'm Calgary and I'm kind of interested like that and seeing what happens when like our migration from Google to Coda and we and we pick up and move off of some of these representations or some of these ideas what that looks like. And I'll pass it over to Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;04;03;21","00;04;32;19","Hello, I'm Stephen. I'm based in Toronto and yeah, I'm interested about the generative business. I think this paper starts to create and I've had some good conversations with Dean actually, and we've been chewing over how much this may be opens new doors maybe is a step too far at this stage and well, other doors we might have the we can step into."
"Speaker 3","00;04;32;19","00;04;39;15","So it's I think it's an interesting set of mirrors and the alleyways to go into."
"Speaker 1","00;04;41;09","00;05;03;06","So I'm curious what those doors are, which ones have ramps, which ones are downhill, which ones are a spiral staircase? Like what places would one go from this paper? And I'm sure we can start even writing on our 33.2 slide, like, what are those doors are they ajar or are they locked."
"Speaker 2","00;05;07;11","00;05;33;28","So Daniel, one of the things in I don't know if this is sense making or just messing with something, but if a city was made up, oftentimes like what we see in some of the empty ashes work and then there were markup blankets all over the place, what might that look like relative to the sort of the the city that I live in or the city that you live in or the city that Steven lives in?"
"Speaker 2","00;05;33;28","00;05;51;05","In are there ways that we can either dissimilarities and are there real differences between what that sort of makes your world markup blankets would represent as versus their actual representations of actual cities? That's one of my questions."
"Speaker 1","00;05;54;14","00;06;16;17","So let me kind of unpack that. You're talking about the M.C. Ascher art with the stairs going in different apparent directions and asking whether those portals would reflect intelligently designed transporters or what does that physical or cyber physical city look like?"
"Speaker 2","00;06;17;03","00;06;28;10","Yeah. And many of these live streams, you've had one image on the slide that has the ants walking around the I forget what that symbol is."
"Speaker 1","00;06;28;18","00;06;30;06","Yeah. Mobius strip with an answer."
"Speaker 2","00;06;30;11","00;06;37;15","The movie a strip. So that would be an example of a real representation that we could generate. But it's not a city. That's my question."
"Speaker 1","00;06;40;26","00;06;43;04","OK, Stephen, and welcome, Dave."
"Speaker 3","00;06;45;28","00;07;11;13","Yeah. Is that as it is? I mean, it also takes me thinking about cyclotrons or just simple transect walks, which is what you can do in a participatory engagement with a town or something where literally you transact, you walk through cross-section of the town that you don't want encounter with the way sort of structuring participation. But it's, it's an interesting question you right?"
"Speaker 3","00;07;12;06","00;07;30;16","So basically start to move through and we go through a path and start to see what's on that route. And it's the same thing. That's the question that goes back to you as to why the doorways. It's like the difference. So where do I find my doorways and stuff squeezing through the doorway or when do I need to again step back and find the unifying principles?"
"Speaker 3","00;07;30;26","00;08;09;12","And when do I need to go back to accuracy? Complexity, and when do I go in to try and force through the doorway, you know, and active influence is allow me to step back and hold more rather than try and not worried about fitting through the doorway. However, as we realize we're talking here, like at some point you need to put stuff into the communications encoder and Google Docs, you know, so in some ways you're going to categorize for practical, practical purposes, right?"
"Speaker 3","00;08;09;12","00;08;20;08","But it's not the same as walking on the Mobius Strip. So there's an interesting challenge as practitioners that we face Hmm."
"Speaker 1","00;08;21;17","00;08;50;08","OK, welcome back, Dave. I hope it's working. Just everyone remember to, you know, if you're not talking and turn off all your messaging applications, the idea of the transact, that reminds me a lot of ecology where we know that there's spatial and temporal variation but a common approach is to take a transect like either going up an elevation gradients or going within the same elevation gradient."
"Speaker 1","00;08;50;08","00;09;27;28","So those are kind of like the two directions that we always talk about going on, the rotational component that climbs straight up the hill to see how elevation changes biodiversity or to go at the same altitude maybe on a north to south to ask how does latitude influence biodiversity at a given elevation that's like that ISO contour. So then the transect is a sampling approach that in the context of a generative model gives us a picture of the map of the territory."
"Speaker 1","00;09;28;11","00;09;29;22","So yeah. Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;09;30;24","00;10;05;12","Yeah, that's good. I think it's probably been ported over when whoever did that is probably more used in participate tree development and community development than participatory theater. And so it's like support development might touch on it, but a lot of times of work doesn't really let up when you go there. They just talk about scenes and situations. But I think the transit is a nice way to sort of walk through and get a cross section in that kind of semi scientific way."
"Speaker 3","00;10;05;25","00;10;27;17","But I actually then was much more interesting than going for social topography and just allowing people to get the whole landscape out there, which in some ways once we get into the kind of agent based work which I didn't know about that, but you know, then the argument would be, well, the transit is already adding all this complication."
"Speaker 3","00;10;27;17","00;10;57;29","You've got people walking, taking a cross section of the town as opposed to having something nice and clean. So I didn't some we won't go even further, but you my experiences as well it's OK if you regime if attention is being organized around a certain type of act of inference. Right so yeah you don't be doing if you're deducting because you just get completely swallowed it's swallowed up by it so that that could be interesting so cross over that."
"Speaker 1","00;10;59;09","00;11;22;09","Well it's like one way to take the transect and perhaps a Noel transect would be a quote straight line that would just be unbiased. It's a simple choice. And then in a city you might want to take that transect or you might be on rails, so you might be taking the f muni in San Francisco and that's like giving you scenes of city life."
"Speaker 1","00;11;22;28","00;11;45;18","And that actually speaks to the difference between Kronos and Kairos. Kronos is like that straight line that just doesn't care whether you're putting the meter stick over the city or the mountain. And then Kairos is like that streetcar or the path that's like you're walking along the path, but it might have curves, but that's the path that you're on."
"Speaker 1","00;11;46;01","00;11;48;01","So then that's more like Kairos."
"Speaker 2","00;11;48;14","00;12;13;09","Then yeah. So I don't know whether the author was intending this, but one of the things that I took away from the paper that I thought was really potentially an amazing insight from the paper was the fact that if you go into a city, you can get a sense of a feeling of the city. So there is a collective feel you can I'll take my own personal example."
"Speaker 2","00;12;13;18","00;12;48;05","You can go into the city of Barcelona and it isn't just where it is situated on a coast there is that fundamental feeling difference. As somebody who is now within that geographic territory, then the one that you you sense when you're in Madrid or when you're in Lisbon, they each each have a collective feel about them and it isn't just that you want it to be different because the architecture is different or where it's where it's situated on a hill is different."
"Speaker 2","00;12;48;12","00;13;19;18","There's actual social aspects of that feeling which make themselves present and which you attune to. So I don't I would never argue with the fact that as an example of a collective act of inference that cities couldn't exhibit those those types of of not just behavior but sense of, of who we are and what we are, what we are."
"Speaker 2","00;13;20;14","00;13;45;12","But I'm not sure like again, I'm not sure if it the scale aspect of this actually works because as I said in my mind, I could do the extra thing all the time. I can twist things and invert things, but it's hard to do that with dead things made of concrete. Not I'm not saying it can't happen, but I don't see examples of that out there when things scale up and out."
"Speaker 1","00;13;46;23","00;13;47;21","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;13;50;27","00;14;25;24","Yeah. And so as you walk in, if you say walking down these routes in Barcelona, for instance, is you mentioned that you know, this the route that we pass along and that's kind of what's available. And there's a there's a scale that's friendly to being available. There's a certain size of buildings and certain you know, at the end of the day, if you're walking in or you're going through some ambulatory routes, there's this things available to you there's this, but there's also then what's adjacent to that and what's hidden and what's hidden right next to you."
"Speaker 3","00;14;25;24","00;14;50;27","Maybe there's a homeless person on the site are they on the same route? Are they seen the same things I'm seeing? Are they seeing the same affordances? Are they seeing what's you know, an often that view is where the vantage point is. So whereas with what's behind that wall on the right, what's hidden from the time that we see these buildings."
"Speaker 3","00;14;52;01","00;15;07;01","And I think that that is that's an interesting question of, you know, this the system as seen from a perspective and then this what it's really like in many different contexts."
"Speaker 1","00;15;08;17","00;15;09;12","Thanksgiving dinner."
"Speaker 2","00;15;11;11","00;16;01;11","Yeah. Which which brings me to the rather familiar which to me standing beside it sticks out and up and all over the place and has allusions to termite mounds and, and, and, and like it's one of those attempts, I think to actually mimic the things that we eat here. And it certainly is the oil and ramping. I mean, it's there if you want an example of where architecture is actually doing a symbolic how do you do this rather familiar would be a perfect example of that in terms of what in terms of what is active in for some of the some of the shapes we see kicking out from some of the math that's happening"
"Speaker 2","00;16;01;11","00;16;06;16","in the on the in the statistical mechanics. So that's kind of fascinating to."
"Speaker 1","00;16;09;00","00;16;36;18","You know what you mentioned, OK, a few you know little references since we're in the fun dot to there we go viral. So the Tower of Babel weather or whatever it was, it's often at least classically represented as a spiral ascent. Yeah. So that's very interesting that that's it's not like the Tower of Pisa with just rings. That's like ISO contours that are separated from each other."
"Speaker 1","00;16;37;05","00;17;11;16","But there's something about the way that it's classically shown that makes it look more like it's a spiral, which is, as we've discussed from a technical perspective, related to the decomposition of that spiral into an uphill irritation or component and then a purely rotational component. Then the other sort of reference was to William Blake's poem London, where he says, I wandered through each charted street near where the chartered Thames does flow and mark in every face I meet marks of weakness, marks of woe."
"Speaker 1","00;17;12;12","00;17;36;26","So here there's so much about how the streets are chartered, the flow of people, and the river is chartered because it's also part of the niche that's been engineered. And there's also flow. Which brings us back to number 32. That was our big lead in was flow. What is flow and how can different systems have similar mappings of heat flow information?"
"Speaker 1","00;17;36;28","00;18;13;29","Flow, bulk flow, particle flow, liquid flow. So how does flow matter in a city? The sewage going out and the resources coming in? And then also it's like even niche modification on our countenance. It's marked on the faces that Blake is meeting. Aspects of the city are kind of imprinted on them. And then that speaks to what Dean was saying about how there's like a collective feeling that's partially architectural, but it's like a feedback that's complex between the people all the time in the place."
"Speaker 1","00;18;13;29","00;18;14;28","So Dean then."
"Speaker 2","00;18;16;20","00;18;47;06","Yeah. And it's, it's interesting too, because the art of that's part of this, whether it's a cathedral or, or whatever the artifacts are, they get kicked out. We can look at that from an ingredient standpoint. Like we can look at beer as having water and yeast and barley and, and whatever. Right. But but the fact is there's also time required and there's also energy that has to be applied."
"Speaker 2","00;18;47;06","00;19;17;10","And I think that's the part the time and the energy piece of city states that are are the real key to whether or not we can see what as individuals, we we perceive act inference as affording versus what on a collective level, we see active inference as affording. I think where it where it separates is on the specifics of the ingredients."
"Speaker 2","00;19;17;10","00;19;21;28","But where the common is is in terms of the energy applied and the time required."
"Speaker 1","00;19;25;06","00;19;26;05","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;19;28;29","00;19;55;22","You know, with the idea of the time and energy, I mean, and we're talking about scale and scope, you know, when you're around the tens I mean, back in the day, there was that big, there was a boat full of important people. I don't say royalty or the politicians or whatever, but they were on the Thames and the boat kind of sank and the people in the water, because the water was so putrid and rank that a lot of them died basically."
"Speaker 3","00;19;55;27","00;20;20;14","And and that instigated a lot of the cleanup. So I suppose there's this question of like how close is close? You know, like you get closer to the water and at some point you put your head in it, you can't really make anything out of water. You know, then you've got like certain vantage points which allow you to understand that you're in a charter Thames you get so close, you could be in any body of water and then you move out further."
"Speaker 3","00;20;20;15","00;20;49;09","So there's a there's this there's a scale dependency in terms of how you can structure. You relate to the information and then just, you know, whether you like it, there's a structurally dependent nature of the scale of the Thames, right? So I can't walk across the Thames and it's too small compared to that Wall Street. So these are these are some of the questions in terms of how the information's going to be processed and how much of that information is adjacent to someone, how much is it's hidden?"
"Speaker 3","00;20;49;26","00;21;08;29","Because those people on that boat, they live next to a smelly Thames for a long time. Actually, the people in the House of Commons have scented handkerchiefs. They got their nose so that they could overcome the smell of the sewage in the Thames. And so you know, at some point they got they got up close and dirty to it."
"Speaker 3","00;21;09;05","00;21;13;20","And probably change their perception of what was really going on."
"Speaker 1","00;21;17;05","00;21;49;01","Interesting. So another thing I had written down and kind of connecting us to some of the core terms in active affordance which is the capacity for action and those are the opportunities for policy selection. They're chosen among the different affordances and in cities, it's very related to ability and access to people who are walking down the street are able to enter different doors and they're able to sit down in different places."
"Speaker 1","00;21;49;01","00;22;22;28","And so I think that's a very tangible and important example of embodied, extended and cultured, et cetera, cognition, all these and other letters, because it's something that we all experience. They're issues that people really care about and putting them under a descriptive, I hesitate to say neutral banner of affordances, financial affordances or physical, or however it may be, it helps us have a discussion about like what the affordances should be."
"Speaker 1","00;22;23;14","00;22;39;15","Should you be able to get into the bus in the back of the bus? There's trade offs for that. You know, maybe it's harder to clock the fares, but then it might be easier to access for some people. But then now there's this ability for people to evade the fare. But then how bad is that relative to the busses being late?"
"Speaker 1","00;22;39;15","00;23;30;16","If everybody has to go in the front like all of these kinds of trade offs, act of inference is giving away to talk about the age and tic level, the individual person on the streets of the city and their perception cognition and action, which are selected from their affordances, which are situational, not just like all people can go up a staircase and then we have a individual level model and can ask then, OK, collective model feedback with a niche, and then where adults paper takes it is like the city and the states as active inference agents composed of subunit active inference agents, just like we can have an active model of a body as well"
"Speaker 1","00;23;30;16","00;23;35;21","as of the cells Stephen Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;23;35;22","00;24;21;27","I'd be curious what your thoughts are on this, Daniel, in terms of when when we have the active inference models like you mentioned, know often, you know, particular low dimensional ways to get into sort of types of user attention. You know, maybe it's the model of the nature of people, you know, looking at this that they're attentional states, X, Y and Z and the coastal, the challenges, once you go and you start walking through different doors and you're in a town and you've got this question about what, how do you model that when when the actual low dimensionality becomes very hard to to work with and I suppose that question then is at what point"
"Speaker 3","00;24;21;27","00;24;47;18","do you look at what actual people are doing, which hasn't happened as much in active inference, and then try and go back and try and understand, OK, what is what they've done and how that's inscribed on them, each reflective of the action policies and versus how much is it about looking at the sensorium that might explain the generative model that we anticipate going on in emulating that?"
"Speaker 3","00;24;47;18","00;25;12;25","And so that might relate to I suppose you might have that same question that, you know, when you try and do an agent based model of a few ants and as a conceptual and when you try and understand what answer to in situ, you know, because obviously that gets kind of complex, right? Because they're all moving around. So I don't know that it has a correlation to that question in that field as well."
"Speaker 3","00;25;12;25","00;25;32;07","But I think that relates here to this situated cityscape scale because it's very granular once you get into that. And in some ways it's nice to make it become like a mind. It's nice to make all of that because suddenly it kind of fits in with the modeling that we kind of use. Right. And in some ways it might."
"Speaker 3","00;25;32;07","00;25;49;03","So there may be some validity, but it may be that the we have to bring in that mind body environment, dynamic or mess that opens in questions about what how do we go about that good question."
"Speaker 1","00;25;49;03","00;26;18;11","So here on this slide, we have the dimensionality of active models. So we can even just emphasize maps, not territories. And then what what does the next step in formalizing this model look like? So let's think of a specific city situation and then we can talk about like modeling that city situation and what would the dimensionality of the model be?"
"Speaker 1","00;26;18;12","00;26;44;23","Where does regime of attention come into play? So what would be like a city situation? Commons situation, fringe situation, important situation, like what's a case that we care about in a city, maybe one that involves complex interactions between, for example, bureaucracy, which was a main topic of the paper and legacy history and affordances of agents I."
"Speaker 2","00;26;45;27","00;27;17;06","Think to get there you'd have to have a lot more of the bottom up aspect of that being honored as opposed to more of the top down control piece. I don't know what the final product would look like because it's act of inference. I would be inferring and I would think that there would be there would be 13 million architects and one citizen which is not how cities are typically designed."
"Speaker 2","00;27;18;21","00;27;33;16","And that's one of the struggles that I have with this in terms of drawing, of drawing a parallel across scales because there's only one of B, but I've got however many neurons and I'm kind of dependent on those."
"Speaker 1","00;27;34;08","00;28;03;22","So OK, yes, I see where you're going. And I think we'll we're going to keep the bottom up and top down. And I think this modeling approach, it's not the only one, but starting with a scenario and kind of like Bruno, the tours actor network theory or aren't appropriately we can start by identifying traces and action trajectories in that scenario."
"Speaker 1","00;28;04;16","00;28;33;21","And let's see if in a bottom up way on our first pass, we can get to like a skeletal active model and then the iteration is infinite slash perpetual. So I don't think it's about just going for one, getting bottom up input once and then laying the groundwork down and then progress crusties from there on. It's an iterated process and this is how we start from the bottom."
"Speaker 1","00;28;33;21","00;28;57;19","So we're going to kind of like start from the bottom up of a scenario that's real, that describes subject verb object that people will recognize person gets on bus and then let's think about what active core terms we would want to apply to different nodes, recognizing that even the assignment of internal external blanket states, it's conditional on our model."
"Speaker 1","00;28;57;26","00;29;05;15","It's not like the door is a blanket state outside of us modeling it a certain way. And certainly we know external and internal are that way as well."
"Speaker 3","00;29;05;29","00;29;36;01","Stephen And then this this question of model and of course this is where the nation how much the needs can come in I think one of the things if we're taking more modern societies, I mean certainly more recently is there's been an increasing role of this top down my call literally copy and paste. I mean in Canada they've got something called Shopper's Drug Mart."
"Speaker 3","00;29;36;01","00;30;01;22","They've got these kind of stores now and having worked in some agencies, graphic agencies is I can just imagine like there's like a design for a store. It gets tweaked and it literally and this couldn't have really happened in the past. It literally gets copied and pasted and it looks like it, you know, it looks like, oh, here's another shop that's another drugstore, but more like a chain, you know, franchise."
"Speaker 3","00;30;01;22","00;30;24;10","McDonald's is a classic case of suppose there's some of that fashion, but it's pretty much like Plunk, Plunk, and in some ways that's that that now there's an infant is kind of devoid from active inference. And that maybe part of the problem is the more that it's done that way and the less that there's a kind of an even in the top down, there's not really even an inference process going on there anymore."
"Speaker 3","00;30;24;11","00;30;37;11","It's like, what are we going to do? I'm just going to copy and paste using a machine, something that was done elsewhere, not even contextualized from the top down anymore. It's just we just completely bulldoze whatever we need to make it fit."
"Speaker 1","00;30;39;05","00;31;05;00","Agree that that's the franchise model, which allows for rapid deployment, for example. And then on the other side, from the user's perspective, maybe walking into a franchise is comforting and there is a reduction of uncertainty about I'll seven is where the cereals are up. Wow. I was right there actually. They're even though I've never been in this city."
"Speaker 1","00;31;05;25","00;31;33;28","And so that is definitely a evolutionarily novel context to have that level of precision of like what you'll find somewhere you've never been. But it allows for an increasingly globally accessible reduction of surprise. And maybe we're seeing that the reduction of uncertainty of what is there and the quality and how many grams are going to be in that box and the profit margins of everybody down the line."
"Speaker 1","00;31;34;24","00;31;52;09","That system in many cases displaces the, you know, hand shuffling of granola and every little co-op having its own granola blend. And these are definitely scenarios that can be models of active inference. Dave And then Steve."
"Speaker 2","00;31;53;21","00;32;18;25","Yeah, the cut and paste mentality for corporate decision making in particular is really destructive of the single biggest determinant for where you're going to locate a new business if you're a corporation, either putting in your own outlets, doing franchises, is there lots of competition? There's lots of competition. That's the location I want so you've got all these outlets competing with each other."
"Speaker 2","00;32;18;25","00;32;47;17","When you go across town, there's this whole underserved area where everybody would be happy, including your employees and your stock owners. I've seen this in when a Walmart came into my old town, the one big draw that would send people to the Kmart is Kmart had not changed any of their layouts for decades. So all the little old ladies who had trouble remembering where they lived could still find the granola."
"Speaker 2","00;32;48;09","00;33;02;29","So what happens when one Wal-Mart opens up across the street? Well, they went in, reorganized Kmart and all. The little old lady says, well, if there's no reason to go to Kmart anymore, I might as well save a few cents at Wal-Mart."
"Speaker 1","00;33;04;17","00;33;23;01","And and again, on the first pass, it's like it where there's less access to that thing. But you go, Well, I already know people are shopping here, and now I can draw people who are shopping and people who are new. It makes makes dollars. Doesn't make sense. What do they say, Stephen?"
"Speaker 3","00;33;25;24","00;34;02;19","Yeah, this this question about how to deal with a niche is a massive, massive challenge, you know, because the the bottom up ability to self-organize once that's lost, often you do. You're now in a different regime. You've lost something and it becomes it becomes augmented by these other because it's not even like we say that somewhere we look they don't necessarily look like if I was in a town, I might look where people are shopping."
"Speaker 3","00;34;03;03","00;34;33;23","But actually what's happened is they're looking at the output of some metrics which tells someone head office the the key performance indicators from which they can algorithmically make some decisions and it all starts to roll out. And one of the things that does mean the initial stages with, say, food, like one reason for say, oh, why would I go to McDonald's?"
"Speaker 3","00;34;34;26","00;34;56;03","Like, well, at least they think they wash, they don't know it. But by washing everything in ammonia or by basically by things always not having a code, I which is not an incidental thing in some areas. So you go there and it's like it becomes like this will never fall below a certain standards that's what their main thing is."
"Speaker 3","00;34;56;12","00;35;15;23","We've got buckets and buckets of disinfectant around the back, so you never have to worry about any of the equipment, blah, blah, blah, because the downside of that is that you get into this vicious cycle of mechanization which suits that kind of producer that."
"Speaker 1","00;35;16;02","00;35;54;22","Reminds me a lot of our discussions with Stephen Fox, I think in 27 about industrial engineering and before Dean could even reload, there was the craft dimension and it was about the integration of craft and industry and how just bringing up here's the tolerable limits like that. Does it mean that you're going to take it to some extreme over mechanic sized way but balancing those two, I just want to return to a specific scenario, particular scenario in a city that will help us extend and connect to the paper."
"Speaker 1","00;35;55;03","00;36;23;17","And then we're going to go through some of the terms and actually just stay with one model and look at what does an active inference model of a city look like? Some people may read Savile's paper and then think, OK, it was prose. I didn't see a figure. I didn't see an equation, I didn't see an example so what are we going to do to actually connect this to my local public transit planner or this grant that we have in this area?"
"Speaker 1","00;36;23;24","00;36;24;04","Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;36;25;05","00;37;06;21","We could use an example helping to connect people, connecting across agent culture and using public spaces and Internet access. So using actually the project we're just looking at the moment where we're putting in a wi fi mesh in a community as sort of a newcomer community, relatively low income. So there's questions about, OK, do you do you bring in resources so that people get more stuff at home?"
"Speaker 3","00;37;07;09","00;37;35;05","And then how much of that stuff at home is enough? To leverage something outside of just in sharing? How does that then leverage doing something with it back in the community, making it something that extends the niche, you know, and things like Meetup. So I think that's a familiar platform, which is be quite useful for people to self-organize."
"Speaker 3","00;37;35;18","00;37;50;00","So we see this ability to do that through the Internet. But of course the will was the ability to do that in real life as well, like the coffee shops, the cafes, you know, so you know, you know, anyway."
"Speaker 1","00;37;50;14","00;38;15;02","Yeah, let's pick a we can do like a meet up, you know, planned or unplanned meet up at a certain spot. But let's pick like a very specific scenario where somebody can say, I haven't seen that be modeled this way. There are new ways that we can now talk about that scenario. So, Robert, many important areas connecting across ages and cultures, et cetera."
"Speaker 1","00;38;15;02","00;38;19;02","So let's think of some public space like we could do."
"Speaker 3","00;38;19;03","00;38;43;11","Say a cafe, a cafe adjacent to a park. Let's say that and we know that that might be related to other cafes, which we say if there's this cafe next to a park and how does that relate to you know, getting a coffee? But obviously it's not just about getting the coffee, is it, that there's an interest in."
"Speaker 3","00;38;43;23","00;39;08;13","Yeah. What does that relate to the niche? So we're going to talk about this. So how does that relate to the niche, the ability to have action policies, the ability to serve service needs? Yes. But also service wants and loves. So actually in actually one thing that you might find an interest in, in, in the in the developed world when they're trying to look at more complex context is you got needs, want and love."
"Speaker 3","00;39;08;17","00;39;24;28","What would what needs to happen? What would I want to happen, what would I love to happen? And often what would love to happen is actually more generative we often everyone wants to talk up the needs or I need to get a cup of coffee. OK, here you go. I need what she needs now. I need a drink."
"Speaker 3","00;39;24;28","00;39;46;10","OK, here you go. And it's kind of stuck, right? Well, what do you want? What would you love? And that's kind of what humans have a role in you know, we're not a machine that needs filling in one Avon's. So I wonder how you what your thoughts are in terms of how that so a café should we think of because we've all going to have a different cafe in our minds here."
"Speaker 1","00;39;47;23","00;40;16;27","Let's yeah I agree. You know it shouldn't be like the cafe on in my little town on this corner so we're going to talk about a cafe adjacent to the park also. Dave, thanks for the cool sumo references in the live chat. I think that's an example of how you can scaffold and use ontology as a thought pump and explore formal dance towards the formal and then back towards the qualitative so it's a cafe adjacent to a park."
"Speaker 1","00;40;18;01","00;40;46;26","We're not describing the territory that would be like a Boris horror novella where we're trying to describe to the atomic level, you know, the paint coding on the street light. So dispense, we're doing a human centric model. Maybe there are assistant animals, but we're going to build up the model and that's why we're discussing this on the slide with dimensionality."
"Speaker 1","00;40;47;22","00;41;17;02","So what's the dimensionality of a cafe next to a park? I mean, the question barely makes sense. You can have a parameter in your state space for every molecule of air, but we're talking about a communicable, simple model that might be on some sort of preda optimal front Bayes optimal front of accuracy and complexity. So it's like I can't explain this to the local politician in a third of a seconds, but 3 minutes is probably too much."
"Speaker 1","00;41;17;09","00;41;28;08","So we're going to find some communicable level of detail and make a use oriented act in skeleton and then see where that takes us down."
"Speaker 2","00;41;29;15","00;41;45;23","So this is a I'm asking this question because I don't really know if we've got a cafe adjacent to a park. Are we having some kind of a are we assuming some kind of a compounded sense around what is an attractor state here?"
"Speaker 1","00;41;49;08","00;42;13;13","So it's a great question like dwell times, like maybe there's some transition frequency from the cafe, you know, from non locations that we're not even discussing. It's not the whole world. This is our map. It's just a little map into the cafe and then from the park to the cafe and then there's like the ingress and egress of the park and then it's relationship."
"Speaker 1","00;42;13;13","00;42;23;21","So we could even start to think about like nodes and edges that are connecting the location of a person. Stephen And then we'll start working through the list or feel free to say in."
"Speaker 3","00;42;23;23","00;42;48;29","Yeah, I think that's the image I was thinking about. Like the non equilibrium steady state is. So maybe we need to think, OK, you got Cafe Jason, subpart F, OK, so like you say, you could be what's the non equilibrium steady state of that grass if there's grass on the edge of the park, right? OK, what's the non equilibrium steady state for the the behavior section?"
"Speaker 3","00;42;49;05","00;43;17;18","And actually some really interesting work and that's how we have does with behavior settings so maybe that could be another. So and of course we'd have to see what scales like what sort of scale scales friendly to this kind of question. If, if the behavior setting was just kind of that's kind of an idea of the niche almost as is capitulated by each person."
"Speaker 3","00;43;18;22","00;43;27;06","And of course this is where the challenge is in terms of if I'm going to be taking the sensory state perspective, I kind of have to take an agent."
"Speaker 1","00;43;27;24","00;43;34;29","Yes. There's no sense to outside of a specifically defined agent. So which agent are we going to be looking at?"
"Speaker 3","00;43;36;22","00;43;40;03","So we take the risk. You want to take the barista. That might be easier."
"Speaker 1","00;43;40;16","00;43;41;28","Look, let's just do human."
"Speaker 3","00;43;42;12","00;43;42;23","OK?"
"Speaker 1","00;43;43;07","00;44;05;09","So these are people who we're talking about. There's other entities there could be drones flying around for sure. There's ants. There's all kinds of stuff happening in the territory, allegedly. But we're going to be making a reduced dimensionality model, maybe one that has low computational overhead or maybe one that's easy to communicate or one that explains a lot of variance."
"Speaker 1","00;44;05;09","00;44;14;03","But not every single nook and cranny. So we're going to be talking about humans in the cafe adjacent to the park in a city Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;44;18;08","00;44;40;06","So if we're looking at this through the lens of act of inference, there's two things now that have been raised. One is, do we have to we have an attractor state and meaning where people migrate, will they move, will they congregate, will they gather? And then Stephen brings up the idea of, OK, so how do people remain in that non equilibrium steady state?"
"Speaker 2","00;44;40;07","00;45;07;21","How does the expectation now get realized? Once the migration has occurred? This is what an action and act active inference working together allows where something gets kicked out at the end right? Some with some material thing with with ingredients that we can now account for gets kicked out at the end. But in the meantime what we have to do is we have to actually look will people gather?"
"Speaker 2","00;45;08;02","00;45;53;01","Is this actually a place that people will now move towards? And then because that's a city, right? They've all congregated and then we have to ask is will expectations meet intentions? That's what act event that's what going through an active inference process actually affords. It doesn't guarantee, as you said, Daniel doesn't guarantee this. The specifics and the particulars of what it does hold up on a more abstract level for a longer period of time before energies actually apply, before something actually materializes and I think that's what gets most people up because there isn't a critical path ready to be fulfilled."
"Speaker 2","00;45;53;07","00;46;15;11","It's an act of inference process that has to have certain anchors in the ground before you can before an anchor is meaning abstract that you have to have available that act as affordances, that it eventually kick out the blueprint, which eventually kicks out the dwelling the edifice."
"Speaker 1","00;46;17;14","00;46;18;14","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;46;20;28","00;46;46;28","And so you've got this kind of broader dynamic. So again, so resolving scales again. So it comes in because it's like there's going to be the broad level customers and someone serving in the cafe right a Starbucks customer barista. It's a tie in with that vibe. You've got they've got a different tell logical expectation even in the abstract."
"Speaker 3","00;46;46;28","00;47;12;23","We haven't even worked out who they are right now. Of course, that's not quite so true. If one of the customers is an adult with three year old child or the three year old child's expectations, a slight difference in terms of what it is to go in there. So you've got this, but essentially speaking, there's it's a regime of behavior that each of them are logically attuned to to some extent."
"Speaker 1","00;47;13;15","00;47;38;24","Look, let's go through these terms in this order and there's a specific reason why. And so affordances are capacities for action. They're what actions are selected from. Yes, they're ecologic or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Which affordances will we put in our model? So taking out a phone of your pocket, it's an award. It's but is that the model that we're making?"
"Speaker 1","00;47;39;21","00;48;10;26","So again, not the dimensionality of the territory, but what is our model are we interested in treating the person like a blob? And the affordance is literally just go to the park or leave the scene and so we can have a simple matrix. Are you going to be in a three by three matrix? Are you going to be in the cafe, in the park or neither with a transition on the off diagonal and the diagonal would be your dwell time."
"Speaker 1","00;48;11;20","00;48;40;00","So that is like the person is just like a point OK? Also, affordances can be zoomed in and a lot more granular. The affordances could be the angle of every joints in the person's body and that might be relevant if the steps are going up to the cafe and someone doesn't have a joint mobility to raise up their leg a certain level, then that is going to influence their transition movement matrix."
"Speaker 1","00;48;40;17","00;49;05;11","So when we call Green to just the blob and the three by three transition matrix, which is simple, that may abstract above important layers. So that's why iterated modeling is really important. But iterating means we need to have something there to iterate on. So for a first past, do we want to do a model of movement of the people among the different spaces?"
"Speaker 1","00;49;05;23","00;49;36;29","So that would be like one example. Another example would be like, we're interested in drinking behavior. So the affordance that we're going to model is the choice of no drink, coffee, tea, smoothie. So we're making a kind of behavioral economic model and actually we're not as interested in the movement's transitions. We're interested in how vanish the temperature influences people's buying habits."
"Speaker 1","00;49;37;22","00;49;57;00","Or we could have both. We could have where they are as a blob and what drink they buy or we could have where they are and all their joints and what drink they buy. And then looking at the phone, that's the dimensionality of the model it's not the dimensionality of the territory because we're still talking about the same place."
"Speaker 1","00;49;57;10","00;50;09;04","So what kind of affordances do we want to focus on? Like we know that you could do anything a person could do is going to be in Affordance, but what affordances are we going to be talking about here?"
"Speaker 3","00;50;11;08","00;50;42;12","I like the idea of working with the where, the awareness, and I think there's a lot of tendency for what person orders, what the thing is, the sort of thing that you can in some ways potentially emulate in that I don't think you can emulate the way in this in a lab. But so what sort of zones might they occupy like this, this around table there's around the doorway."
"Speaker 3","00;50;42;19","00;51;01;14","So it could be, you know, you've got these. Yeah, you've got the park. So even more broad. Yeah, it might be a very broad level. There's the cafe, there's the park. And then that can, that can then break down by some zones or maybe they fall out from the model, you know, some yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;51;02;13","00;51;36;25","So these, this is going to be fun because I'll just do like so the diagonals of the Matrix, this is like a movement matrix. So the stay is the number could be like zero to one. The probability in the next hour or the next minute is not an absolute as claimants time dependents. And then you could imagine within staying at the cafe, we could make another little matrix that had the table, the bathroom, the counter, but it would be only and strictly within that top left."
"Speaker 1","00;51;36;25","00;52;15;12","So that's the sub matrices that we were looking at in number 32. So we're going to be in a state and that's what course screening means somewhere. Someone can't look at our matrix and say, how could you not have modeled the counter in the bathroom when people have great, we made a three by three matrix, now let's make a sub matrix and let's make that fine grained or that sub matrix could be defined in terms of chronos, like what is your coordinates in the cafe three, comma four, or it could be Kairos they're at the counter or they're doing something spatially, but we're not putting a number on it."
"Speaker 1","00;52;15;25","00;52;38;17","So staying is the on diagonal because we're making a coarse grained movement model. We're not looking at their elbow angle, we're not looking at where they are inside the park. This is a first iteration of a model. And then if there was surprise coming from our model discrepancies with the observations, just like asked if we could update our model."
"Speaker 1","00;52;38;24","00;52;57;02","But again, iteration entails that we need a complete model before there's anything to discuss. If people are just throwing out random core terms and terms outside of the active ontology, it's part of a discussion, but we're not iterating on a model, so it's fine. But that's not making an active inference model. Dean And then we'll continue."
"Speaker 2","00;52;57;23","00;53;30;26","So I like this because materialization piece. Now what gets kicked out is on a gradient descent. But but my question again then is so when you're talking about affordance, are you including availability as in what Steven was talking about? Because of where I am now, things are at hand or proximal or are you talking about threshold lowering, meaning ease at which something can be attained because they're not they're not the same thing."
"Speaker 2","00;53;31;04","00;53;42;25","And I want to know whether or not we're including both in terms of crystallizing this materialization Stephen."
"Speaker 1","00;53;42;25","00;53;44;13","And then we'll come to that."
"Speaker 3","00;53;47;00","00;54;21;08","And this is helpful with like nothing is good, this idea of truly down. And I suppose this is this is this extra question. Maybe it's at the side there, but is how much to does the nature of things change by being in the cafe cafe, you know, open how much? By staying in one location or moving between locations is that question about this kind of I suppose is this kind of fluidity?"
"Speaker 3","00;54;21;08","00;54;24;24","Right. And that's an interesting side question, which."
"Speaker 1","00;54;26;21","00;54;45;14","We can we can put it in our model. We can will be able to actually iterate on that question. And I would argue this isn't drilling down. This is building up there's nothing to drill into until we have this fully described. Otherwise, it's just like to people are you can't drill into a linear model that hasn't been specified."
"Speaker 1","00;54;45;24","00;55;02;08","So there is no drilling down until we're talking about something particular. And then we could coarse grain or we could fine grain or we could iterate or elaborate or transpose. But we're at the zero to one step in active modeling here. Dave."
"Speaker 2","00;55;03;19","00;55;33;18","Yeah, and making those transitions actually changes the inventory of potential affordances of other participants. When you walk into a room, you give every person in that room seconds to either greet you and establish a potential relationship or to say, Oh, this guy doesn't want to talk to me. Or He would have nodded yeah. Goffman goes into painful detail on how that stuff works."
"Speaker 2","00;55;34;02","00;55;42;17","The and that one relationship can persist for years. The guy you nod to and the guy you never to, you know it up or down."
"Speaker 1","00;55;44;17","00;56;15;11","It's very personalized and cultural, and that's definitely like a level that we we haven't even gotten into the entire agent IC but we can we'll, we'll get there and we can see is this part of our zero to one model or is that going to be included in our one to two model but repeatedly returning to not not you know, saying about thing but just repeatedly returning to aspects of the territory before we have a model to iterate on, the model is going to remain uncompleted."
"Speaker 1","00;56;16;14","00;56;34;26","And you'll have done a partial inventory of a territory in a totally ad hoc pseudo linear way when it could have been all there and iterated using our ontology and framework, which we're here to work on. Dean and then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;56;35;20","00;57;09;16","Is the sedan and maybe you can help me because I say when I think about this, the availability piece because it's proximal doesn't mean that it's not on a on a high shelf meaning high threshold. And I can't, I can't get the coffee back down that's full of the beans, right? So again, I like what we're doing here, but I still ask when we're talking about affordances, how are we are we are we looking at two ways of describing that at a minimum?"
"Speaker 2","00;57;09;24","00;57;20;14","Because that's what I'm hoping we're doing. But if we're not, what are we doing Stephen, you were going to you were going to give me some some thoughts around that."
"Speaker 1","00;57;21;21","00;57;23;07","Yeah. First, Stephen, with the recent."
"Speaker 3","00;57;26;10","00;58;02;05","You know, that got me thinking. Now, but the question I suppose is as well as well as iterating on, um, you know, we can run multiple examples off of so they might be one of these cases. Like you say, many things can happen, but you could one, you know, you could have two or three types of models that are kind of simple and you run them all many times and see OK, and maybe change some parameters to make it more likely that there's a long term relationship, that there's a perception, binding energy that kind of is exhibited."
"Speaker 3","00;58;02;14","00;58;27;17","And then you could sort of look for clusters of transitions, clusters of behavioral patterns, right? And so then we're sort of comparing patterns and to some level, then it's in a way it becomes a sense making process for us. And the advantage we've got is we can tap back into our embodiment because we're humans. So we can say, OK, I see in that, what sense do I bring a higher dimension to all of that?"
"Speaker 1","00;58;27;28","00;58;44;28","Yeah, you can have 500 groups of three separate and make their own active model of a cafe adjacent to a park, but they all have to get that zero to one. Otherwise if they come together, what is there to discuss? 500 times 00."
"Speaker 3","00;58;45;12","00;59;03;03","So I wasn't so much thinking, I wasn't so much think about different people. I'm thinking even though the person does the module, you just literally run it lots of times, but slightly different tweaks. And then so you get you can sort of get something from that. I would say that's a different type of maybe you start to see some of these patterns."
"Speaker 1","00;59;03;13","00;59;36;06","That's iterated modeling with getting the first version and then changing parameters and iterating and then looking for patterns across iterations that are achieved via a certain strategy of changing parameters but incomplete model will never run so yes, there's a total space to do stochastic simulation and run one model 5000 times and 5000 different models one time. And every other combination, they all are predicated on iterating on something that already is there."
"Speaker 1","00;59;36;18","00;59;38;00","And so that's the zero to one phase."
"Speaker 2","00;59;38;00","01;00;05;05","Steve I was puzzled how you translate the stories that you find in so many academic papers or semi academic papers. First of all, just the greatest the so say this happens, this happens is how do you turn that into simple, very simple exists, exist person, person enters room and I'm idea and you throw it in the model and if it says contradiction, something's wrong."
"Speaker 2","01;00;05;13","01;00;33;03","If you're really confident that, hey, that's the way the real world goes, you negate it, you throw a does not exist and you got a universal and run it and it blows up. Now I guess not everybody does. What I said is wrong. Let's find out what I did wrong. Cool stuff. You don't even need the exotic. You don't even need to re create mathematically oriented modeling tool."
"Speaker 2","01;00;33;04","01;00;41;08","You can just do it in pure yes or no, true or false logic. Just realize that this morning in my head lit up."
"Speaker 1","01;00;42;02","01;01;08;11","Nice. Yeah. Take people out their work. Just use their word and they asserted that this. And then I hope they used nouns and verbs. And if so, then you could be able to parse it. So let's we're making a course grained movement model. So again, it could be fine step. You could have the affordance be to take a step and the location had to be something else."
"Speaker 1","01;01;08;11","01;01;35;00","Fine, great. But we're taking a course. Great. Now we're going to talk about the sense of the agents so their actions are they're movements, which is just a coarse green movement state. That's the actions that they're doing. Inference on what are their perceptions we know about the five, 11 and 55 senses. It's not about the scent of coffee in this model."
"Speaker 1","01;01;35;12","01;02;12;03","Again, the future model with which thing they bought you could go to what is their sense of smell. But here we're just going to do a sense mapping matrix with light. OK, so the cafe is going to have red light. I love red light. So the cafe is going to have basically 80% chance of red light if you're in the dark room, a point to chance of sunlight if you're at the window seat and it's never dark if you're in the park, there's a 100% chance of it being sunlight."
"Speaker 1","01;02;12;13","01;02;17;14","There's no there's no red light in the park."
"Speaker 1","01;02;20;19","01;02;41;12","And there's no darkness in the park. So it's like the daytime. So again, that's iterating. So it's good to keep those things in mind. You like have a coda or a space where you could have everyone's perspective added, even when you're building the first iteration. But some matrices do need to be specified to continue talking about it as an active inference model."
"Speaker 1","01;02;41;25","01;03;10;10","And then neither will say neither. It's never read. There's a rare red light that the cafe uses, and it's half the time sunny and it's half the time dark because that's who knows, we just have maximal uncertainty, but we know that it's not red. OK, so this is how the A matrix in active inference. If you said you're in a dark room where are you?"
"Speaker 1","01;03;10;29","01;03;32;07","Well, here, given these simple numbers, we know that we're in neither the cafe or the park. If you said you're in a red light, where are you? You must be in the cafe. It's the only place with a red light. If you said you're in the sun, what is the probability that you're in the park? It's two thirds roughly."
"Speaker 1","01;03;32;18","01;04;01;09","This is 1.7, and so it's one divided by 1.7 is literally the probability of being in the park, conditioned on seeing sun. So that is Bayesian statistics. It's like we have a matrix of sensory mappings. And then it's like, here's a new observation, it's red. You go, OK, it's point eight over point eight that I'm in the cafe OK, so that is the sense mapping matrix."
"Speaker 1","01;04;02;13","01;04;38;26","What is the inference on what is the s the hidden state where am I that's not directly observed. You're observing only the photons in this model. So the, the, this is a mapping between the oh, the observations and then the s the states that inference is being done on. But aren't they thinking about their to do list. Yes."
"Speaker 1","01;04;39;27","01;05;22;28","In the territory keep it in mind. Add a note, add a comment. We want to hear your perspective. That's not the course Green Movement model. So these are acting from teams for simplifying teams. OK, we have the perception which is the sense here. Three states and we have the locations that inference is being done. Now we can talk about preferences, what our preferences for this is like perceptual control theory, percep preferences are over observations so it's like the preference is to observe the body being in homeostasis."
"Speaker 1","01;05;24;10","01;05;53;22","That's part of the preference specification in active so one could imagine that if somebody had no preference for any of the I don't really care then they would move proportionally to the ratio of the transitions of the Affordance matrix. So if all the transition frequencies were even and there was no preference over sensory outcomes, you would be evenly distributed."
"Speaker 1","01;05;54;28","01;06;34;07","If there is a preference for darkness, no matter how slight and there's any ability to move into the neither, then that will be the attractor because individuals will dwell in a more preferred state because they prefer the darkness which is only accessed here if there's a preference strong, then you exaggerate it like a strong preference for sun. We would see, like everyone or almost everyone in the park, a weak preference for sun would only slightly bias towards the park."
"Speaker 2","01;06;36;04","01;06;54;13","D. Yeah, I think I'm asking should we assume that your preference is to be violently caffeinated or caffeinated, like verdant and not being a smart apple? I'm asking that. Is that the assumption that we're building our model around? Because you asked."
"Speaker 1","01;06;55;11","01;07;02;23","Here's here's the interesting thing about this model as we're building it in the first iteration, the sense is visual."
