all right hello everyone welcome to

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
active lab live stream number 33.1

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
it's november 23rd 2021.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
welcome to the actimf lab

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,920
first-time participants and returning

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
participants and listeners

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
we are a participatory online lab that

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,719
is communicating learning and practicing

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,879
applied active inference you can find us

12
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
at the links here on this slide

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
this is a recorded and an archived live

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
stream

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
so please provide us with feedback so

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
that we can improve our work

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,479
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,040
welcome here and we'll be following good

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
video etiquette for live streams

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
we are in the final two weeks of

21
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
november 21

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
discussing thinking like a state

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,560
paper of choice

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,159
and we have some tentative paper

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
selections for number 34 and likely

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
we'll um take a break and start with 35

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,920
in the beginning of january 22

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
but we're really looking forward to an

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
exciting 2022 so if you have any ideas

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
for people to invite for other streams

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
or if you yourself would like to join

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
then just let us know

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
today in active stream number 33.1 we're

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
going to be learning and discussing this

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
very cool paper thinking like a state

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
embodied intelligence in the deep

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
history of our collective minds

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
by aval aka serval gwen and khalif

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
and it's just a discussion video even

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
though we have the author on the stream

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
which is awesome

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
we're pretty much in the dot one going

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
to

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
go over anything that we want to we can

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
return to some keywords and bigger

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
questions that we raised in the dot zero

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,920
we can add notes for next steps for

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
questions to think about over the coming

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,400
week to touch on again in the dot 2 or

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
possible ways somebody could continue

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
this avenue of research

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
and we will be discussing this paper in

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
next week 33.2

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
okay we'll uh go around and introduce

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
our

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
panel today everyone can give just a

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
short check in they can say hello and

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
something that they remembered from the

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
paper or something that they were

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
excited about to discuss and then pass

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
it to someone who hasn't spoken and then

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
we'll

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
conclude with the author so

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,360
i'll start i'm daniel i'm in

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
california and

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
just as we were discussing right before

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
we started i want to explore this

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,480
aspect of states as anticipatory

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,760
cognizers not just reactive cognizers

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
and i'll pass it to

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
dean

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
hi i'm dean

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
i'm in british columbia and

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,319
ensconced in a uh cedar box today

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
out of my cabin

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,440
and

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
i like the paper uh because i want to

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
see whether or not

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
there are parallels between what happens

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,159
on an individual level what happens on

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
more organized levels of individuals and

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,840
i'll pass it over to blue

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
good morning or good whatever time of

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
day it is in your world everyone i'm

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040
blue knight i'm an independent research

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
consultant in new mexico and i like this

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,519
paper for many reasons but

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,319
my favorite reason is the scale free

89
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
aspect of self-assembly so it's

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
self-assembly at a much larger scale

91
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,760
than i'm used to i normally study cells

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
and sub-cellular organizations so i like

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
how active inference unites

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,280
the things that i like to study with

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,399
statehood and larger scale organizations

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,478
and i will pass it over to first time

97
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,120
participant andy

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,080
hello everybody my name is andy i'm in

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,960
uh richmond virginia i'm very interested

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
in looking at the mechanics of how

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
uh intelligence works through a

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
collective right uh

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,840
are there universal things that we can

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
that we can apply for

105
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,320
just the movement of information through

106
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
um relatively close systems and

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
and how to modify that

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
the cognition that goes along with it

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
now we'll pass it along to stephen

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
hello

111
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
and good morning steven here in toronto

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
um

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
yeah i'm interested in this paper

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
in terms of the scale the social

115
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,039
uh impact of of of looking at states and

116
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
how active inference scales are and also

117
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
maybe a little bit provocation in terms

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
of like how much are we looking at

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
the the

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
the dynamic states

121
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
of organisms or macro organisms how much

122
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,840
we looking at the state of a

123
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,239
dead set of artifacts that helps us

124
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
work with our niche

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
and the scale of working with macro

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,520
artifacts in the niche as much as

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
macro

128
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
cognitive agents so i'll be interested

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,919
about that um and i'll

130
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,199
um

131
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,120
pass it i believe

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
to daniel

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
thank you steven um i think we've all

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
we non-authors have gone so

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
serval would be awesome just to kind of

136
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
recap

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
hello and

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
what

139
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
brought you to writing this paper as we

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,680
kick off the discussion

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,759
so hello my name is aval and arseval i'm

142
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
training physics epistemology um great

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,199
things

144
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
and uh what i'm interested with this

145
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
paper is to show that we if we accept a

146
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,360
naturalist understanding of recognition

147
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
which is a saying that is based on

148
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
actual systems actual dynamics

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,880
then we can't resist the conclusion that

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
social systems are organized in a way

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,639
that is cognitive

152
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,280
and i found this uh basic constellation

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840
pretty important because

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,759
then there are no limits like systems

155
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
that are cognitive uh work in the way

156
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,360
they are structured to work and we can't

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
uh we can change things and we can

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
understand how change

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
will affect how things behave

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
which is pretty good jones because i

161
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
think

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
it's pretty likely that the national

163
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
state systems that is dominant today

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,039
nation state capitalism system

165
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120
is uh dying and is uh basically bringing

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
us with it

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
so we have to uh explore the state of

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
alternatives pretty quickly and

169
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
efficiently and this

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
uh needs a reflective understanding on

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,280
uh what this database is

172
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
great and i think it's um

173
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
it's a

174
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,800
a pun or a homonym that will return many

175
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
times what are the states because we

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,599
talk about partitionings of states a lot

177
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
in active inference internal blanket

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
external nested systems and now we're

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
talking about the nation states of

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,680
um

181
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,560
how are social systems cognitive we use

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
that state-based partitioning to talk

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,759
about other cognitive systems

184
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
ones that are designed or evolved

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
and so

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
we're applying active inference to study

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,639
the cognitive properties of

188
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,680
states um steven and then anyone else

189
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,919
and i'll just keep on adding notes or

190
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,840
questions and people can look at it or

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,199
suggest things in live chat go ahead

192
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
stephen thank you

193
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
yeah i think it's also cool with active

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,479
inference there's that kind of

195
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,240
ontological challenge whereby we're

196
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,360
dealing with non-equilibrium

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
dynamical states in a nonlinear system

198
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
which gives rise to pullback attractors

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
which

200
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
have this non-equilibrium steady state

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,919
quality

202
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,879
where

203
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,640
however often states are

204
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
or say we're thinking quantum theory or

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
something you know they're like it goes

206
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,919
from

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
this particular state to that particular

208
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
state right so

209
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,080
um there's there's also that

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
interpretation of what can be done

211
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
with states when you start to have

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,839
non-linear dynamics at play

213
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,599
thanks blue

214
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,880
so

215
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
something that i mentioned uh in the dot

216
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
zero video that i'm interested in maybe

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,959
exploring a little bit deeper is like

218
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,080
what do states aggregate into so what is

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
like the grander scale if we're all just

220
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
self-assembling into something and and

221
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
the quantity of states that are produced

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
i can't remember who said it maybe it

223
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,080
was a veil that states um like arise as

224
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
a result of war

225
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,560
and

226
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
faction and division and so as we are

227
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
progressing forward in time

228
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,760
there's an increased amount of faction

229
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
and division and like it doesn't matter

230
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
how

231
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
homogeneous a population is they will

232
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
find something to divide about and so

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
like this creates more city-states

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
within city-states within city-states so

235
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
is there some kind of equilibrium like

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
attractor space for like the optimal

237
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
number of states or is it all going to

238
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,839
be like unified or is it all going to be

239
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
dissolved at some point

240
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
thanks steven

241
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
actually that's a good point there blue

242
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
there's also something interesting about

243
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,399
democracy they say that for democracy to

244
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,360
work

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
it almost has to be a split of around

246
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
45

247
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
to 50

248
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,920
um

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
[Music]

250
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,079
between different opinions parties

251
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
otherwise like if basically one party is

252
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,320
supported by 65 70 of the people

253
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
generally speaking

254
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
it doesn't work very well because then

255
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
there's no there's no dynamic i suppose

256
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
to move backwards and forwards um so i

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
think that's quite interesting

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
so when we talk about the minimum number

259
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
of like states or or

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
entities to exist for democracy to

261
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,560
function opinions um

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
it's interesting you know in the system

263
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,279
that mike levin works with back from our

264
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
july live stream the computational

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
boundary of itself he works in planaria

266
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
which are regenerating organisms but you

267
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
have to have a minimum number of cells

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
and particularly like a minimum number

269
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,360
of stem cells so i think it's like a

270
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
thousand cells at base and like 120

271
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
planarian stem cells or you don't get

272
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
regeneration and so like what kind of

273
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
dynamic is required or how many people

274
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
and even for like you talk about hunter

275
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
gatherer organizations like

276
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
50 to 500 people they think made like an

277
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
optimal hunter-gatherer colony like less

278
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
than 50 and you're going to be eaten by

279
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
coyotes or whatever so

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
where is that optimal number in

281
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
statehood what does that look like

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
yeah what

283
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,040
aspects of the system are necessary

284
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,200
sufficient incompatible at odds with

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
certain kinds of

286
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
regimes of state and it is really funny

287
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,720
how

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
we talk about policy selection policy

289
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
sounds like it'd be more from

290
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
international policy than it would be

291
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
from reaching for your cup of water

292
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
and then

293
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
we talk about regimes of attention

294
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
usually people hear regime they're

295
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
thinking some historical regime of a

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
state

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
whereas regime of attention doesn't

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
necessarily carry that connotation

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
so linguistically there's a lot of

300
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
contact points and that's why i think it

301
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
was a awesome contribution by cerval was

302
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
to just draw those out ground it in the

303
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,000
physics of critical systems and of

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
cognitive systems and

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
that's what is contributing to hopefully

306
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
some of the ways we'll explore it's

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
going to be

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
used going forward so dean and then

309
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
stephen

310
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,639
yeah this this might sound like pushback

311
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,360
or challenge or whatever but i it's just

312
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
i have a personal issue with the entire

313
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
idea of scale free

314
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
like that there's some sort of

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,040
invariance across scales and i i think

316
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,680
that like when we see for example a

317
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
lower case a

318
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,880
morph into an uppercase a

319
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
even though they are of the same

320
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
categorical type

321
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
and fit in the same place

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
in the alphabet there is a there is a

323
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,000
change that goes on and so there is a

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
scale

325
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
variance aspect to this that i think

326
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,880
so again this is my my sense of it as

327
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
opposed to sort of

328
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
the agreed sense that there's a

329
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
scale-free

330
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
process in play

331
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
the other thing i would

332
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
i would wonder a little bit about is

333
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,720
when we

334
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,800
take a constructivist

335
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
view

336
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
a city as built

337
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
i'm not sure what happens to the

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
bi-directionality

339
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
that

340
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,839
active inference

341
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,120
affords so

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
again i i'm not saying that

343
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
we can't find

344
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
qualities

345
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,920
in both but i'm not sure that a city

346
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
as a reflection of something

347
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,519
constructivist is necessarily how living

348
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,440
things reflect

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,560
and predict but again i'm open to having

350
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,720
my mind changed

351
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
thanks dean stephen and then all have a

352
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,599
comment on the constructivism

353
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
i was just also i think it's a good

354
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
point we blew about the uh mike levin's

355
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
work and and the

356
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
question of um yeah how things are

357
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
scaling up and of course the big thing

358
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
that mike levin did mention that you

359
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
know they they've got these quite a lot

360
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
of ideas around how things grow multiply

361
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
and relate but no idea how they stop

362
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,720
and that's kind of also interesting in

363
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
terms of you know when we think about

364
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
scale as like

365
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
has the organism reached its point

366
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
because the top scale the maximum scale

367
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
has kind of been reached or is there

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
some sort of

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
is it that there's it's the dynamics at

370
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
a mid scale which is like an action

371
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,920
scale

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
so it's not it's not that it's ever

373
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
arrived at this thing it's just arrived

374
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
at this

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
meso action policy landscape

376
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
which is

377
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,720
um available uh and

378
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
you know is that availability then

379
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
understood from what's inside or is it

380
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
something that's checked to something

381
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,360
external in the environment so

382
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
that that i think is an interesting

383
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
question

384
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,279
thank you

385
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,079
um capitalizations yeah you have to the

386
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,279
state capital capital punishment

387
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,839
there's so many um other funny word

388
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,800
plays but to the constructivist comment

389
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
so

390
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
um

391
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
one sort of simple constructivism would

392
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
be like i mean there weren't bricks

393
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
there and now there are so the city was

394
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
constructed and now it's the scaffold

395
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,440
for us to interact in so you ask dean

396
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,839
where's that bi-directionality

397
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,519
so i think there's a few

398
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,000
ways to talk about the bi-directionality

399
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,279
so first is niche construction

400
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
can be a symmetric relationship we talk

401
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
about the agent

402
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
modifying the niche and the niche is

403
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
modifying the agent and so it's like you

404
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
have the blanket as the interface and

405
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
then there are

406
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
action and inference on both sides of

407
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,199
the blanket being used as an as an

408
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
interface and so it's more like a

409
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,720
co-constructionism

410
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,600
but if you know lego set a is building b

411
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
while b is building a that starts

412
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,320
looking more like interactionism

413
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
because

414
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
it's not just instructions put the brick

415
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
here

416
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
it's a specification of a protocol and

417
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
an interface for interaction and that's

418
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
what opens the door to improvisation

419
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
into other kinds of dynamics that aren't

420
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,639
just simply like assembly of the 3d

421
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,040
printer and then the other point and

422
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,880
then dean is it reminds me of dennis

423
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
1995

424
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,720
book darwin's dangerous idea

425
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,040
where he talks about basically two ways

426
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,519
that you can talk about the appearance

427
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,800
of design

428
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
in natural systems which are cranes and

429
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
sky hooks and so if you look at a

430
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
skyscraper you think how could that have

431
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
appeared one approach is they built a

432
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
crane to put that last top piece on and

433
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
if that crane was too big to construct

434
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
then a smaller crane built that crane so

435
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
you could have a cranes all the way down

436
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,280
like small things were built and

437
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,799
scaffolds were in place that were

438
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
removed later to result in this

439
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,720
skyscraper

440
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,439
or you can just cut the knot and just

441
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,880
say well maybe there was a sky hook and

442
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,559
they just latched it to the sky and then

443
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,600
built down so that's like top-down

444
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
constructivism

445
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,880
appeals to skyhook technology whereas

446
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
bottom-up

447
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,080
emergent process-based co-constructivism

448
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,880
is more of a crane based approach

449
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,520
so i think that's a very good point how

450
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
even with constructivism we can still

451
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
retain a lot of the important aspects of

452
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
constructivism like physical

453
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
construction but we don't need to fall

454
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
into a

455
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,160
uni-directional um or a top-down trap

456
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
so dean what do you think about that and

457
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,600
then stephen or anyone else

458
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
i think i think the important point

459
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
daniel is what you just mentioned which

460
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
is the trap of

461
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,919
prematurely collapsing to the top-down

462
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,240
privilege um

463
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
for example uh

464
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,559
if you go to if you go to just outside

465
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,400
of denver

466
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
you end up in a place called red rocks

467
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
and then the question becomes did

468
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
did uh did somebody enact red rocks

469
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
because they put a stage at the base of

470
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,200
an amphitheater or did red rocks enact

471
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
everybody who

472
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
was attracted to that place and so all

473
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
i'm basically suggesting is is

474
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
is

475
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,559
when we look at how things are

476
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
constructed we don't want to lose sight

477
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
of the fact that sometimes

478
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,120
things construct us as well sort of the

479
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,479
sky hooks aspect of it

480
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
thank you dean stephen

481
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
yeah and also i mean cranes and sky

482
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
hooks

483
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
it gives that idea of how it links in

484
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
they're also dead items right so they're

485
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
both tools or they're both objects

486
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
um so

487
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
and we can we can bring in

488
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
sky hooks which might be

489
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,919
informational instructions or cranes

490
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,880
which

491
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
are

492
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
you know places to carry the bricks that

493
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
are going to build things but i think

494
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,760
that when we talk about that markov

495
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,600
blanket and what goes both ways is

496
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
yes i think when we're dealing

497
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
particularly with dead things

498
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,200
like bricks and that we construct an

499
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
environment now it's a bit more

500
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
complicated when we impact an

501
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,720
environment that also grows and changes

502
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
and is alive

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
however when something comes back the

504
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
other way from the environment is it

505
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,360
constructing us or is it

506
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,720
scaring us or is it giving us lots of

507
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,919
little

508
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,799
punches in the gut in which we heal

509
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,320
so i'm wondering whether the other

510
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
direction

511
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,039
it can't construct us

512
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,600
but what don't kill us makes us stronger

513
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
type of thing

514
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,840
thanks steven

515
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
um andy please

516
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
and then blip

517
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,600
dean i think in the context of

518
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
cognition in the state

519
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
the specific um the element that's

520
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
missing right is what's the relationship

521
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
between the nation and the state right

522
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,679
so the nation would be the bottom-up

523
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,280
information or the bottom-up cognition

524
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
and the state could be theorized now as

525
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
the top down

526
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
and then broadly speaking right the

527
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
nation creates the state

528
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
the state the existence of the state

529
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
changes the circumstance the changes in

530
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
circumstance forces the nation the

531
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
nation the people

532
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
to rethink how they're operating in the

533
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,280
world around them because their

534
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
circumstances have been modified and now

535
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
you have this constant bi-directional

536
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
relationship between bottom up and top

537
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
down in the context of state versus

538
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
nation and modifying circumstance over

539
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
time

540
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,440
thank you

541
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,559
blue

542
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,039
dean go ahead oh yeah dean

543
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
yeah andy uh

544
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
i like what you're saying except

545
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
it's already collapsed to an a to b

546
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
relationship

547
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,280
and i think what active inference allows

548
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
for is to keep things up on it on a

549
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
generalized abstracted level it doesn't

550
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
have to be here's the nation a and

551
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
here's the people b

552
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
that's the difference

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
essentially is if you want it to be an a

554
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
and b thing

555
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,799
go ahead that's that's

556
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
good for argument's sake but in fact

557
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
what active inference does is it keeps

558
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
one side of this open

559
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
and not necessarily specific

560
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
it keeps it

561
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
in order to be predictable it asks the

562
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
counter factual what if

563
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,840
as opposed to having that

564
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,039
pre-presented as the relationship

565
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,440
and it's new

566
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
it's a new type of relationship that's

567
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
arising and i think that's right

568
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,840
explored in the paper in the deep

569
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
history section there's really the

570
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
specifics there's the minute particulars

571
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,960
of the specific states that we have

572
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
and typified by westphalia and a bunch

573
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
of other historical events that the

574
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,360
specifics matter we're in a complex

575
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,320
system the trajectory really does matter

576
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,559
blue

577
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,880
so i totally forgot what i was gonna say

578
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
um

579
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
but i would like to maybe challenge andy

580
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,559
like what is the the difference between

581
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
the nation and the state like is the

582
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
nation like the people that make up the

583
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
state and then the state is like the

584
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
collective of the people like is it like

585
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,280
a a part whole

586
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,760
concept or are they two separate uh

587
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
larger entities and people make up both

588
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,799
um so

589
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
words

590
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,919
depending on which definitions you go

591
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,280
with right it gets a little bit squishy

592
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
in the context that i use them

593
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,960
state is a construct

594
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
the political organization of a people

595
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,720
is

596
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,919
is downstream of uh the shared identity

597
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,280
of the people

598
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
of a people so the nation would be

599
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
broadly the largest sense of shared self

600
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
distributed among a relatively close

601
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,240
system in this regard and the state

602
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
being the construct by which these

603
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
people organize their affairs inside of

604
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
their nation

605
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
that's a relatively new idea right the

606
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
idea of a nation and the nation state is

607
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,280
relatively new as far as like an overt

608
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,559
construction

609
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,279
um beforehand in in the age of absolute

610
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
monarchy there was no separation between

611
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
the state and

612
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
the people right it was all embodied in

613
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
the in the person of the sovereign

614
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,640
um so

615
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
different different historical contexts

616
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
different periods of time different

617
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
cultural context now you might get uh

618
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
different definitions but in the way in

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
which i was using it

620
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
the state would be

621
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,400
a

622
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,679
policy

623
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,520
requirement of the culture in which it

624
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,279
was born right it's why american

625
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,120
democracy functions significantly better

626
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
than south sudanese democracy even

627
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
though they have literally the exact

628
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,720
same institutions

629
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,840
so daniel maybe you want to flip to

630
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,880
slide um

631
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
33 i think

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
like where we we like kind of show in

633
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
the paper all of the like things that go

634
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,799
into like the production

635
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,520
of a state and so i like i'm curious as

636
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
to like

637
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
where nation fits into this um is it

638
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
like the in the collective identity or

639
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
is it like

640
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,799
um

641
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,720
a relationship between like nation and

642
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,559
collective identity or just what your

643
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,120
thoughts are on that

644
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
yeah absolutely collective identity to

645
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,279
me would be the definition of a nation

646
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,880
shared sense of self

647
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
everything else are things that you may

648
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,159
or may not need a state to accomplish

649
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
that may or may not be more efficiently

650
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,400
conducted in the auspices of the state

651
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
right um control the monetary flow you

652
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
probably need something as sophisticated

653
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,039
as a state but to transfer resources

654
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
back and forth you don't

655
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,720
right you can you can grow grain and you

656
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
can you can trade it for for me

657
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,039
uh go ahead

658
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,840
well just the the um collective identity

659
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,159
i'm just thinking about in organism

660
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,960
and the liver and you know the bone cell

661
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,080
it's like

662
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,840
collective identity doesn't mean

663
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,960
identical phenotype and so it makes me

664
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,600
think of a cultural memory where each

665
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
person maybe there's a few touchstones

666
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,039
that 80 percent of people know about or

667
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,960
increasingly though there's less and

668
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
less shared information

669
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,039
amidst

670
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,400
the informational changes that are

671
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
happening so what does that mean

672
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
when everyone's only going to have a

673
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
little partial facet of the collective

674
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,720
memory

675
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,919
on board

676
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,760
but maybe they can enact broader

677
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,559
processes that are truly collective so

678
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
how do we respect

679
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
differences

680
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,240
and

681
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,400
shared aspects across multiple levels

682
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
so um blue and dean and then serval want

683
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
to hear what you're

684
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,960
thinking about this

685
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
so just like daniel how you were talking

686
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,679
about like the bone and the liver cells

687
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,240
like making up an organism um you know i

688
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,039
think that that speaks here to what's um

689
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
the specialized roles

690
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
and like the density of settlements

691
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,799
enables that like functional

692
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
specialization and

693
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,320
like you can have a blacksmith and a

694
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
shoemaker and a farmer and everybody

695
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
takes on their own little role and then

696
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
goods can be redistributed so it just

697
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,240
like reminded me of that and like that

698
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,279
functional

699
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
specialization um and the importance of

700
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
it

701
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
thank you blue dean and then cerval or

702
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,480
pass

703
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
yeah when i was watching the 33-0 and i

704
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
saw this slide thank you blue for asking

705
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,679
for it to be um

706
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,240
brought brought back again here this is

707
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,039
again an uh a specific to a specific

708
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,559
because it's historical and it's

709
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,080
reflective

710
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,039
and

711
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
the fact that we can look at things and

712
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
say this is what happened we can look

713
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
back on them i'm not sure we want to

714
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
necessarily conflate that with

715
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,200
active inference which is about the

716
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
recursion

717
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,600
so

718
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
this is what happened we can see

719
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
how things moved across a timeline from

720
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,039
point a to point b a city state evolved

721
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,880
but is that recursion

722
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
which is what active entrance is about

723
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
which is variation upon variation

724
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,000
i'm not again i ask

725
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
is that

726
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
i know how we can i know how we can

727
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,559
diagram it and represent it but is that

728
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,520
representative of what actually occurs

729
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,440
in recursion when certain thresholds

730
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
appear and then just as quickly

731
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,399
disappear

732
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,559
interesting so

733
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,520
serval if you'd like to add anything

734
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,840
and then stephen

735
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
so there are a lot of threads that were

736
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,919
opened what are you asking my opinion

737
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,799
about

738
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,040
um

739
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,159
[Music]

740
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,760
i think part would be just uh on

741
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,159
nation and state similarities

742
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
differences um what is and what if

743
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
and then more on this sort of

744
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
integration

745
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,440
slide

746
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,120
where does active inference come into

747
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,559
this tying of the knot

748
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
how does acting in france

749
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
uh about nation i don't think it does

750
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,919
nation is simply a collective identity

751
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,000
that is hated to a political entity it's

752
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
a

753
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
community of

754
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
peers that happen to have some stakes

755
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,960
and power over the behavior of the

756
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,440
institution

757
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
material states

758
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,159
and the fact is that nations are not

759
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,840
universal you have a lot of states that

760
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
are not nation states that are not

761
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
suited to a community of peers for

762
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
example

763
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,559
the roman empire it was a

764
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,840
empire which means that you have people

765
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
who get the power that

766
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,480
form authentic group that is the roman

767
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
and you have all the rest of the people

768
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,799
that exist in there

769
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,679
that also are ruled by the um

770
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,679
by the empire that is dominated by the

771
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,679
romans so you do not have a community of

772
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,760
interests that

773
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
illustrated to a state you have a

774
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
netting group that dominates other

775
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,360
ethnic groups through a state

776
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,520
the nation are not um

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
they are not invariant aspects of what

778
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,919
the state is

779
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
however they are um

780
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,440
a collective identity or at least ways

781
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
to build boundaries between a group and

782
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
ad group there seem to be an environment

783
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,120
of

784
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
efficient human collective action

785
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,360
according to astrum's principles

786
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
so

787
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,720
there may be

788
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,760
more tendency to build nations to the

789
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,039
nation states

790
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,159
uh when you have more uh importance uh

791
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,000
between group selection

792
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,600
and

793
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,159
it is said that i don't know of any uh

794
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,120
computational quantity work that uh

795
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,760
but he said that modern europe is pretty

796
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,840
extreme in terms of um

797
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,559
of

798
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,080
between group conflicts of war

799
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
because

800
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
the diamond agreement is that the

801
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,799
geography basically enables trade at

802
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,720
great scales but prevents

803
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
the constitution of an empire

804
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
in

805
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,399
europe

806
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
so

807
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,080
historically there were a lot of states

808
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,279
in europe as compared as say uh

809
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,440
in china where you have a big state that

810
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,159
is

811
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,279
i don't know

812
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,760
in terms of surfaces maybe uh two or

813
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
three times like western europe is

814
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
and more integrated than when you can

815
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,799
have in south america because of the

816
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,640
mountains

817
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
um so you have a pretty ideal regime to

818
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,919
get a lot of intergroup conflicts and to

819
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,320
get a selection regime that favors

820
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,200
nations uh organizations that somehow

821
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,919
collate with states and that's what

822
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,919
happened to be instituted through uh i

823
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,279
don't know westphalia and french

824
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,440
revolution i don't know the story of

825
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,760
that there are a lot of parkway pathways

826
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,000
in europe from the states but in europe

827
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
you got nation states originated you've

828
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,799
got pretty aggressive kinds of

829
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
imperialism that originated

830
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,519
and both can be traced i think uh to an

831
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,840
intense regime of uh between group

832
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,039
selection

833
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,399
and of war

834
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,519
and

835
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,679
there are results that tend to say that

836
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,840
war

837
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,159
explains in the sense predicts

838
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,200
more political complexity which is

839
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,720
uh

840
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,480
a debatable construct that basically

841
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,159
maps

842
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
this kind of integration of society

843
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
so

844
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
the uh

845
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
history of europe

846
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,080
of modern europe specifically um and

847
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,559
meteorology everything past the roman

848
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,600
empire

849
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,120
would have uh selected for both

850
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,159
nations

851
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,360
and

852
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,559
aggressive kinds of imperialism and this

853
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,960
is the kind of organization we get to

854
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,519
live in now

855
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
thank you

856
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
serval just like the ecological

857
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,559
regularities through evolutionary time

858
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,360
scaffold the evolution of an organism's

859
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,559
cognition

860
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,279
this is a transposition of that argument

861
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,760
to the biogeographical

862
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,559
and contextual and ecological factors

863
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,559
that give rise to and scaffold the

864
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,159
development of states as things as

865
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,080
cognitive entities there are some

866
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,320
parallels there so it's an awesome point

867
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,639
thank you blue and then stephen

868
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,039
there is a

869
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,679
pretty important things trying to say it

870
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,919
that is a state does not actually

871
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,640
correspond to a nation maybe states have

872
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,519
original nations maybe they are

873
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,840
assigned nations now but a state need

874
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,279
another entire nation you know you

875
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
cannot states

876
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,679
like cultural population united states

877
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,480
uh

878
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
well that's kind of

879
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
the usual deal actually

880
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
so

881
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,720
yeah election is a collective identity

882
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
of

883
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,799
in a community of interest states uh

884
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,480
control systems

885
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,640
uh built from administration and it can

886
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
be and often is captured by an elites

887
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,320
that is um technically

888
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
social like socially in terms of

889
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
cultural norms lobes pretty distinct

890
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,679
from the people controls

891
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,200
chicken in the egg

892
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
egg as the secreted

893
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,480
state

894
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,120
chicken as the life form but then

895
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,919
there's a co-evolution so that paradox

896
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,000
stands there too blue

897
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
steven and andy

898
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,918
i'm gonna defer and come back around to

899
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,480
my idea so stephen and then andy

900
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,679
yeah i think

901
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
the the whole

902
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,839
gale question is very interesting here

903
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,599
um and um

904
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,000
where it sort of so often i mean in the

905
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
european union you've got the european

906
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
union it's kind of a reunion of

907
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,440
pluralistic partners is the idea and

908
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,359
you've got this tension where one side

909
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,800
is basically saying no you're not you're

910
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
a state

911
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
and we want to be a nation

912
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
an independent nation there's this

913
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,679
tension right between oh no we're a

914
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
union we're a union

915
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,639
and when actions are working that works

916
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
the union right and uh so i think that

917
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
there's a scale where people try and

918
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
work at and and the rate at which people

919
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,359
work at

920
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,920
what's the dynamics of people

921
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,880
in the same way that when you have um

922
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
politics seems to have a very slow

923
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
trajectory you know things shift you

924
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,720
have the state you have your end

925
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
identity of your party however nearing

926
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,880
an election

927
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,119
a week this praise is a week is a long

928
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,280
time in politics and it is near an

929
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,560
election

930
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
the dynamics start to become much faster

931
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
things can change much quicker

932
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,160
so this scale question again comes in is

933
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,200
what is

934
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,760
what is a unit of identity how does it

935
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
manifest at different rates

936
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,040
um

937
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,680
and just one other thing in terms of

938
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,720
identity is in

939
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,520
participatory

940
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,839
community-based action research

941
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,599
okay they talk about community is

942
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,480
actually a unit of identity it's almost

943
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
like there's so many different types of

944
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,839
fluidity at the community level and

945
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,920
overlaps between communities that it

946
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
becomes a unit of identity to actually

947
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
work with in measuring stuff

948
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
we tend not to do that like at the

949
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,200
higher level the nation it's just the

950
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,599
flag is a unit of identity

951
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,359
it's a very which hasn't maybe changed

952
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,920
in 100 years so it's an interesting

953
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,160
um as well as the you know what how much

954
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
can things change and how much are the

955
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,040
ability things to change caught up

956
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,880
in the artifacts that embody them

957
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,960
the artifacts that constitute them in

958
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
some case

959
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
so andy

960
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,359
any comments or to blue

961
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,280
yes thank you um

962
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
so

963
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,800
i was going to well let's let's go deal

964
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
with what you just said right community

965
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,760
smallest action uh element of action in

966
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,599
this context

967
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,359
uh identity is the smallest

968
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,960
element of action

969
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,920
however it is guided or bounded right by

970
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,680
its ability to affect change

971
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,079
so if you if you deeply identify with

972
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,320
one other person in this world the two

973
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,560
of you uh are the small that you have

974
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
you

975
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
identity becomes basically shorthand for

976
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,359
interest we two people by calling

977
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,040
ourselves a group have a certain

978
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
worldview and a certain

979
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
desire to see our interests achieved we

980
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
have the capacity of two people to

981
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,680
accomplish that

982
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
so what is our ability to affect change

983
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,320
at that scale relatively small once

984
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,839
you're talking about anything larger

985
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,280
than interpersonal relationships right

986
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,520
but it doesn't change the fact that your

987
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
identity is shorthand for your interests

988
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
and that we all at whatever level or

989
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,440
scale we're operating at are pursuing

990
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
our interest to the best of our ability

991
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,960
bounded by relative power right um but

992
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,079
this idea of of nation versus statehood

993
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,680
survival you're absolutely right the

994
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
state is a thing independent of a nation

995
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
sometimes they correspond and typically

996
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,040
we say that that is

997
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,640
um that that's a good fit because

998
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
otherwise it's an empire right otherwise

999
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,040
it is somebody else's ideas of what

1000
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,400
constitutes

1001
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,920
uh right or wrong in terms of

1002
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
projected values or institutionalized

1003
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
values that are now imposed on you

1004
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,640
because

1005
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,400
the state is not representative of your

1006
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
cultural world view or your shared

1007
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,160
identity it is something provided to you

1008
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
by somebody else's in the form of empire

1009
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
but the question that i had right going

1010
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,320
through the slides

1011
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,079
there was this idea that the state as a

1012
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,280
top-down hierarchical control system

1013
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
what is then nation or what is an

1014
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
identity

1015
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
how does that function the sharing of

1016
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,880
information and cognition relative to

1017
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
the state

1018
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,720
thanks for the uh text-driven question

1019
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,640
it was a core argument of the article

1020
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,960
just to quote that states can be and

1021
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
should be understood as hierarchical

1022
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,720
control systems

1023
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,440
so

1024
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,599
um avail if you want to give a direct

1025
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,839
response otherwise dean in blue

1026
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,079
so there is a direct response

1027
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,079
uh which is that

1028
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,680
uh to talk of hierarchical control

1029
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,359
systems specifically to talk after done

1030
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,880
control this is

1031
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,560
i think i've

1032
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,960
reframed the same uh point the same

1033
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,160
thing in saying those both uh words

1034
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,480
and of course there is no cognitive

1035
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
systems that is purity of though but

1036
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,880
there are they do not work they live in

1037
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,680
labs and they are not useful

1038
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,200
uh so

1039
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,160
basically uh the organic

1040
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,200
organization of whoever happens to have

1041
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
a say in what the states is

1042
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
is the

1043
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
at least the ascending dynamics in the

1044
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
collective when they are what affects

1045
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,160
uh in bears in terms what uh change the

1046
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,200
priors and the policies etcetera

1047
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,439
so

1048
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,640
in the case where you a defined nation a

1049
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,160
defined entry group

1050
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,560
that happens to control the states

1051
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,280
which i'd say is exceptional from what

1052
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,880
i've read

1053
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,640
you can't say that there is a meaningful

1054
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,560
nation states fit and

1055
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,480
the nations basically the brain and body

1056
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,200
of the state in the sense that

1057
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,839
well the ascending dynamics that

1058
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,200
influence what the control systems does

1059
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,839
in most cases you will

1060
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,520
have i'd say a pretty much stronger

1061
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,680
decoupling because basically only elites

1062
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
would get to say

1063
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,960
in

1064
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,359
what the state does and in cities where

1065
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
in mercedes the elite is not to define

1066
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,359
an ethnic group

1067
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,598
uh

1068
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,560
in that case you will not have a clear

1069
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,280
fit between nation and states although

1070
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,400
um

1071
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,720
of course the committee of power the

1072
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,040
defender states if you conceive it as a

1073
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,160
nation

1074
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
will uh define what the state's prior

1075
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,200
are

1076
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
well pacified to define because of

1077
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,000
course there are the tools that register

1078
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
thank you so awesome lot of hands so

1079
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,560
dean then blue steven

1080
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
um so i want to just

1081
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,359
circle back to what andy just said andy

1082
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,119
when you if if you go and look at

1083
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,960
this live stream

1084
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
three hours from now even when you see a

1085
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
perfect reflection we'll assume that

1086
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,760
this youtube video comes out exactly as

1087
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,359
as it intended

1088
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
i think what you just said

1089
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,599
proves that we're not talking about

1090
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,880
scale free

1091
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,119
talking about scale friendly

1092
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,960
because what you will see

1093
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,319
is not what you just did

1094
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,720
and so i think that that has a huge

1095
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,760
bearing

1096
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,920
on this idea of what we're talking about

1097
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,160
here we can shape-shift into what

1098
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
stephen

1099
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,560
cilit has pointed out here is that that

1100
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
fact that we can

1101
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
fill

1102
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,440
between these two levels of scale

1103
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,680
doesn't mean that it's it's it's one

1104
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,119
size fits all

1105
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,359
it quite literally means is that we can

1106
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,800
fill we can change we can modify

1107
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,040
and i think that's recursion in its

1108
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,800
essence as opposed to

1109
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,480
taking a reflection

1110
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
and knowing

1111
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
that the next time we look at that it's

1112
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
going to be different because there's

1113
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,200
some elapsed time between the moment we

1114
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,079
set it

1115
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,680
and then the moment we heard ourselves

1116
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,599
say it

1117
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,160
dean i think it's an awesome point with

1118
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,280
scale free and scale friendly skill-free

1119
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,760
people usually mean to say that the

1120
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
mathematics or the formalism doesn't

1121
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,000
have an a priori system of interest or

1122
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,160
scale like this is a centimeter theory

1123
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
or this is a kilometer theory so it's

1124
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,560
scale free because it doesn't have that

1125
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,599
a priori reference scale but then scale

1126
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,480
friendly it's almost like how about you

1127
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,800
tell me what scales you've identified

1128
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,960
and let's make them friends

1129
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,880
through interaction and iterated

1130
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,520
modeling and so we're friendly to scale

1131
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
and scaling

1132
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,520
but that doesn't necessarily

1133
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,599
mean it's free although from the other

1134
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,520
side it's also fair to say that it's a

1135
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
scale-free framework in the way that a

1136
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,680
bayesian computational framework or even

1137
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,000
a linear model is scale-free it doesn't

1138
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,319
a priori say that kilometer is the

1139
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,319
default unit for linear regression

1140
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,280
either

1141
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,079
blue and then stephen

1142
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,040
so i think what i'm going to say is

1143
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
going to touch on the comments that were

1144
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,280
made by both andy and cerval um first of

1145
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,800
all in terms of this relationship um

1146
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
like the mutual interest

1147
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,880
being the fundamental unit of identity

1148
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,200
and like collective identity this really

1149
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
goes back to

1150
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
expansion of your cognitive boundary

1151
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,720
beyond yourself and like when we were

1152
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,079
talking about the computational boundary

1153
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,359
of itself again i'm gonna like always

1154
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,920
refer to that live stream but um there's

1155
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
an informational sharing

1156
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,319
when there's an identity sharing so when

1157
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,400
you expand your cognitive boundary to

1158
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,480
include more than just yourself like if

1159
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,839
you have like a really deep connection a

1160
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,000
really deep relationship with one person

1161
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,160
you have like a a great degree of mutual

1162
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
information between you and that one

1163
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,000
person and then so say you have like a

1164
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,920
family unit or like a network of close

1165
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,400
friends there's a lot a large degree of

1166
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
informational sharing

1167
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,480
and so in this

1168
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,720
sense of building a nation

1169
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
um like the fundamental unit of identity

1170
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,960
then maybe is is actually informational

1171
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
so it goes back to like bayesian

1172
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
principles where

1173
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,640
there's this informational sharing that

1174
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,839
that then allows you to update your

1175
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,400
generative model um so so just to kind

1176
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
of speak to that and then also maybe um

1177
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,520
to

1178
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,319
uh

1179
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,440
just like maybe help andy make the link

1180
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,119
like between

1181
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,440
um downward causation imposed by like a

1182
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,680
government or like a hierarchical

1183
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,800
control

1184
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,200
institution and like the the emergence

1185
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,640
that happens like when people come

1186
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,400
together and share information in a

1187
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,960
collective there's a super cool paper by

1188
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,200
david krakauer called the information

1189
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,440
theory of individuality and it talks

1190
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,960
about like in order to become an

1191
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,480
individual and there are many different

1192
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
kinds of individuals but in order to

1193
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
become an individual there has to be

1194
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,480
like a bi-directional information flow

1195
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
that's both emergent starting with like

1196
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,160
the fundamental units like the people

1197
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,079
sharing information there's an emergent

1198
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,079
and then a top down so bottom up and top

1199
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
down and like when you have this

1200
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,359
bi-directional information flow that's

1201
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,079
like what allows you to

1202
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,760
form a boundary i guess around your

1203
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,119
collective

1204
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,880
something like that

1205
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
thank you blue

1206
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,560
steven and then anyone else

1207
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,079
yeah i um so picking up what dean said

1208
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,640
there and um

1209
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,280
and actually blue and everyone else is

1210
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,240
the formulism is is scale free at the

1211
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,839
free energy principle and then you get

1212
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,760
into applied active so then you get into

1213
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,160
active inference

1214
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
which has a sort of scale-free quality

1215
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,160
and then you get into adaptive active

1216
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,680
inference

1217
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
and then you get into

1218
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,800
you know

1219
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,640
inaction

1220
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,720
of adaptive active inference and then

1221
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,960
you get organisms like us that want to

1222
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,359
apply active inference and i think that

1223
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,720
i think it does like

1224
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,960
really start to go scale friendly

1225
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,800
once you start to go up

1226
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,400
um and and one thing that i find

1227
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,920
interesting i've been this actually is

1228
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,000
nice it ties into this infusion space

1229
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,520
work that i do but i look at the face

1230
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,200
and the body so

1231
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,760
at there's a particular scale

1232
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,960
at which my mind is embodied

1233
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,040
and you can see it

1234
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
and the bit that you see is the bit that

1235
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
we show on this screen

1236
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,200
you're not looking at my foot or my

1237
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,240
shoulder

1238
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,760
or my hands

1239
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,680
you're looking at the face

1240
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,280
so the face

1241
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,440
is the embodiment

1242
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
of my

1243
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
mind as an identity

1244
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,000
okay this is my projective identity and

1245
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,839
it becomes very useful

1246
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,000
so it's it's scale friendly at that

1247
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,880
scale but you know until

1248
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,119
the other scales of my body aren't you

1249
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,960
know my liver doesn't do a great job of

1250
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,599
my identity okay and then we got okay

1251
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,200
what scale do i have to get to i'm

1252
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,800
talking around if i'm just talking

1253
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,280
one-on-one i don't sit here waving a

1254
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,000
canadian flag or whatever right now if

1255
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,560
i'm a crowd of a thousand

1256
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
now maybe we need to have a big flag on

1257
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,160
a stick right and that becomes my face

1258
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,640
right that becomes my projection

1259
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,119
but that's a scale friendly because now

1260
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,079
i've again it's kind of gone in and

1261
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,480
recapitulated the environment

1262
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,319
so that's kind of interesting

1263
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,839
um thanks

1264
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,040
thank you stephen cervald

1265
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,040
i

1266
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
don't really get the debates about uh

1267
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,839
scale fiscal friendly thing

1268
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,720
uh because what a scale-free theory is

1269
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,559
is a theory that is

1270
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,079
in principle a formalism that's in

1271
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,359
principle it's not a really different

1272
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,640
scale so for example my opposition to um

1273
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,599
the weak and strong forces that only

1274
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,720
have a

1275
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,640
measurable effect at very small special

1276
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,880
scales uh gravitation and

1277
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,640
electromagnetism they can influence

1278
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,720
things but that are pretty much so far

1279
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,319
well not release money some because you

1280
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,760
have the um

1281
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,720
um

1282
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,880
cons mutual counseling of plus and minus

1283
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,440
charges but in principle it could

1284
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,640
affect things

1285
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,359
at distance because of uh the error

1286
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,640
square

1287
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,040
the repentancy just kidding

1288
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,440
and uh the fact that you have a theory

1289
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,200
that is capri does

1290
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,920
not entail that every system

1291
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,839
where you express the theory is calculus

1292
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,559
for example you have the

1293
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,559
gravitational theory the skeletri but if

1294
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,480
you study the solar systems it has a

1295
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
scale which is about the distance from

1296
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,680
the sun and the uh

1297
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,160
thing apart if you study

1298
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,559
electromagnetic motor it has a scale

1299
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,359
which is uh well the size of the matter

1300
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,119
and if you study a biological organism

1301
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
with a scale pre-formalism it has a

1302
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,359
scale which is whatever scale at which

1303
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,599
the organism happens to exist

1304
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,480
so i don't

1305
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,760
get

1306
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,960
what the debate is about

1307
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,520
[Music]

1308
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,559
dean

1309
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,680
how about

1310
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,599
give a thought on that

1311
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,680
yeah i got a thought on that so i think

1312
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,160
we can see what a reflection is we can

1313
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,480
see what a triangle is we can see a very

1314
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,559
small triangle and we can see

1315
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,480
a very large one those are reflections

1316
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
but that is not recursion

1317
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,000
and as as soon as you get into

1318
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,480
variability upon variability you're

1319
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,760
going to have to come up with something

1320
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
more than a reflection

1321
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
and i think that's why you have to come

1322
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,520
up with something that more than

1323
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,359
scale free

1324
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
i mean we can see scale free and

1325
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
nobody's arguing against that but what

1326
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,319
was i guess what i'm pointing out is

1327
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,520
that if we limit ourselves to that we're

1328
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,280
not going to see the entire picture

1329
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,119
all kind of

1330
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,920
intermediate i think they're both very

1331
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,480
valuable views scale free is certainly

1332
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,720
more aligned with the way that people do

1333
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,440
talk about formal models whereas scale

1334
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,359
friendly is a little more of a dean-ism

1335
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,520
which is always fun

1336
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,920
i see skill friendly as

1337
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,720
emphasizing the active role

1338
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,160
of the modeler in connecting the levels

1339
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,079
so it's not enough to just say like i

1340
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,400
have a stretchy ruler that could apply

1341
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,559
to different scales it's not an a priori

1342
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,079
scaled ruler

1343
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,800
and then making it more of this process

1344
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,400
of approaching

1345
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,880
the mechanisms and the processes that

1346
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,559
are interacting

1347
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,119
amongst scales rather than just thinking

1348
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,640
well we'll put the linear regression on

1349
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,000
a little thing we'll put the linear

1350
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,160
regression on the big thing and then

1351
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,960
we'll have a scale-free applied theory

1352
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,000
this is more like let's take that system

1353
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
as a indivisible unit

1354
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,119
of function and then like interact with

1355
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,559
it in a little bit more of an active way

1356
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,160
and it can still be scale free for those

1357
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,680
who like that

1358
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,599
way of talking about it

1359
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,160
um but for those who want to get to know

1360
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,480
it maybe scale friendly is approachable

1361
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,599
as well

1362
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,079
stephen

1363
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,319
yeah i think

1364
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,839
there's also

1365
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,280
active inference and adaptive

1366
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
active inference and inactive

1367
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
influence so i think like daniel made a

1368
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,040
good point there is

1369
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,839
uh

1370
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,359
keeping the active influence flowed

1371
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,440
through and helping that

1372
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,359
is really useful right so that we don't

1373
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,200
lose the formalism side because that's

1374
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,280
the danger right we clip off the

1375
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
but but there there is something for

1376
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,160
instance

1377
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,839
at what point is adaptive active

1378
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,079
inference possible like is that the

1379
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,920
point when you need to have the brain

1380
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,680
within a reason or there needs to be

1381
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,200
there needs to be some

1382
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,400
generative process that's regulating

1383
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
active inference for it to then adapt at

1384
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,880
different temporal scales

1385
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,119
um now that that raises some other

1386
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,480
questions about exactly where but

1387
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,280
there's

1388
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
that you know even the idea of what

1389
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,359
adaptive active inference and active

1390
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,280
active inference or adaptive and active

1391
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,839
potentially is

1392
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,359
starts to

1393
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,079
then tie in well you know and if i can

1394
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,839
only do certain adaptive active

1395
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,760
inference with the brain then has to be

1396
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,359
the scale of an organism that has a

1397
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,480
brain

1398
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,599
and below that scale it can't so there's

1399
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,960
something

1400
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,160
that becomes transitionary or

1401
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,799
contextual

1402
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,440
dean on this point and then to serve all

1403
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,960
for a combined response

1404
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,480
yeah um

1405
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,160
so again i think

1406
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,920
knowing that a triangle is a triangle

1407
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
regardless of the volume

1408
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,280
of its footprint is is important i think

1409
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,440
when we include updating

1410
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,920
when we include time

1411
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,920
then we should include

1412
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,800
scale friendly so i'm not discounting

1413
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
scale free

1414
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,559
but i'm saying that the updating process

1415
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,480
whether you want to call that adaptation

1416
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,880
or in action the change aspect of it

1417
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,280
doesn't get resolved simply because a

1418
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,200
triangle is a triangle

1419
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,319
if that makes sense

1420
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,559
bucky fuller said angle is is

1421
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,559
metaphysical and general it doesn't

1422
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,480
refer to any specific substrate to say

1423
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,800
that something is a 60 degree angle and

1424
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,040
frequency is always bound up in space

1425
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
and time and the specifics

1426
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,359
so any realized system is going to be

1427
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,960
both

1428
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,440
serval

1429
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,319
so um

1430
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
stephen i think talk about an active

1431
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,839
acting in france rtx in france is uh

1432
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,480
something that keshav introduced in 2018

1433
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,160
i think something like that

1434
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,880
uh tries to reproduce inactive notions

1435
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,720
of cognition from active influence what

1436
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,680
it says is that you have

1437
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,160
agency when you have a hierarchical

1438
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,000
modulation of

1439
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,520
active influence system you have higher

1440
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
level of action fronts that modulate

1441
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,119
lower levels of active influence

1442
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,960
the question it rise is uh basically a

1443
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,640
question that is

1444
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,200
not solved and i don't even know what's

1445
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,559
happening on it

1446
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,800
in the ontology of

1447
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,839
science and naturalism which is

1448
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,000
do you have different level of existence

1449
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,240
or do we have only scales

1450
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,280
and even at this level when we admit

1451
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,280
that we have things within things within

1452
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,760
things within things and that's what the

1453
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,200
world is

1454
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,400
it's complicated

1455
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,640
the thing is that

1456
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,720
uh to circle back to a question that has

1457
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
been raised initially about how what in

1458
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,240
france relates to other values of

1459
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,599
cognition

1460
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,119
um

1461
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,799
the while keyshot

1462
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,119
tries to formalize inactive concepts of

1463
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,839
cognition is entirely wrong

1464
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,920
because in activists they do not say

1465
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,200
that

1466
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,280
organisms are heretically modulated

1467
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,680
acting from theorists say that the brain

1468
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,640
is killed modulated and they apparently

1469
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,960
projected its own activists but we say

1470
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,480
that

1471
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,440
a system that is cognitive must be

1472
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,520
operationally closed which is it has

1473
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,799
set of

1474
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,319
it has a structure

1475
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,240
uh or an organization i don't know which

1476
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,559
because of their consumption uh that

1477
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,359
basically reproduce its own existence

1478
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,920
without any clear support without

1479
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,559
autonomously from its environments

1480
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,599
uh that's not how they say but whatever

1481
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,119
and you have a specific formulation

1482
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,720
that's computational it was formulated

1483
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,000
by um

1484
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,680
people from the basque center of life

1485
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,920
sciences i think the name is

1486
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,480
uh which is uh constrained closure so we

1487
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,720
have constraints that are slow processes

1488
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,280
that shape how uh faster processes

1489
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,480
behave

1490
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,799
and wealth a lot of them and

1491
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,200
collectively this lot of constraints

1492
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,520
shape faster processes so as to maintain

1493
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,160
themselves that is um

1494
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,319
constraint closure and that is

1495
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,319
what's the latest version of um

1496
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,720
on the elective um

1497
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
not agency but autonomy nation is

1498
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
and this entails not hierarchical

1499
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,000
modulation but uh meshed nets of

1500
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,240
processes that make something else exist

1501
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,640
at in between scales

1502
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,880
and the notion of what is the antics

1503
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,839
that choose

1504
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,240
to give this is pretty complicated i

1505
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,040
don't know i a lot of people that think

1506
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,720
that level is just an epistemic

1507
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,000
construct that is built by scientists

1508
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,480
and this is pretty consistent with a

1509
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
radical approach with a mentioned

1510
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,000
approach

1511
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,799
this

1512
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,720
everything becomes ambiguous the meaning

1513
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,559
of every single terms

1514
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,319
become vigorous so

1515
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,359
i have um

1516
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,359
no idea what will be a correct way to

1517
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,200
refer to this

1518
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,240
uh scale free says what it says that it

1519
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,559
is not interested in specific scales of

1520
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,720
behavior and uh it also says implicitly

1521
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,079
when we are

1522
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,160
in the context back in france that it is

1523
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,319
not interested in a specific antique

1524
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,440
level what applies for ourselves applies

1525
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,000
for a mutual organism which applies for

1526
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,240
societies and which in the case of

1527
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,960
vanilla in france also applies for dust

1528
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,160
vertex

1529
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,118
flames and whatever

1530
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,680
so

1531
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,760
i'm not sure we're still and i'm still

1532
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,359
not sure what the national scale

1533
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,280
friendly is supposed to do and uh how it

1534
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,520
relates to uh

1535
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,200
the question of whether states are

1536
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,040
properly cognitive because we don't need

1537
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,760
a proper version of population of scales

1538
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,680
and proper anti-distinction axing

1539
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,799
distinction

1540
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,079
between

1541
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,880
what is uh recursive and what is only a

1542
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,920
scaling variance we only need to

1543
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,720
state what being cognitive is and to

1544
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,119
check whether states are and of course

1545
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,640
uh what this means for the broader uh

1546
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,200
episode constructs with builds

1547
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,760
around this

1548
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,760
thank you sir blue then steven

1549
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,760
so i have to like go back to um the

1550
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,319
active inference live stream number 30

1551
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,640
we talked about how to count biological

1552
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,760
minds

1553
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,520
and really this like raises so when

1554
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,880
you're talking about the distinction

1555
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
between adaptive

1556
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,559
active inference and like mere active

1557
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,599
inference

1558
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,640
um and in this this theory about how to

1559
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,559
count biological minds is everything

1560
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,040
that's biological is do all things then

1561
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,599
have a mind like even down to like the

1562
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,720
you know single cell organisms and

1563
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,359
in this in this paper like there are a

1564
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,119
lot of people who like have this like

1565
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,839
mind life continuity hypothesis and a

1566
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,880
lot of people really um ascribe to that

1567
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,960
so in this adaptive act of inference

1568
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,720
versus mere active inference i couldn't

1569
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,559
find the line like i really pressed on

1570
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,640
matt sims about this um and and he

1571
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,640
responded beautifully like he also

1572
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,359
couldn't find the line so at what scale

1573
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,000
or what level does adaptive active

1574
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,760
inference transition to mirror active

1575
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,960
inference

1576
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,119
and what i'm fundamentally getting at is

1577
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,359
like okay so are you doing mirror active

1578
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,280
inference if you're a single cell and

1579
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,119
you just move forward and back like

1580
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,599
towards a repulsion or an attractor like

1581
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,599
is this mirror active inference or is

1582
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,119
this adaptive also

1583
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,839
and so like adaptation to the niche

1584
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,480
like to me i think that happens at all

1585
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,440
levels

1586
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,119
but there was this distinction made in

1587
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,720
that paper that like adaptive active

1588
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
inference happens when the collective

1589
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,640
forms some like emergent behavior that

1590
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,799
makes it more fitted to the niche

1591
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,440
environment and so like where

1592
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,319
is the state then a biological mind does

1593
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,160
the state make

1594
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,280
um a set of organisms like more fitted

1595
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,960
to its niche

1596
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,599
through this like collective adaptive

1597
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,640
behavior

1598
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,280
or or is it maybe maladaptive

1599
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,119
because overall like as a species the

1600
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,520
more divides we have like the more war

1601
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,480
we'll have i don't know

1602
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,000
thank you stephen

1603
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,599
yeah thanks for this meshed nets

1604
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,680
idea i think that's that's definitely

1605
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,118
true um and uh

1606
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,799
let's kind of fix in with the kind of

1607
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,559
meshed architecture

1608
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,839
um i i wonder if

1609
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,880
like um blue was mentioned about this

1610
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,799
different scales of active imprints um

1611
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,240
identity is quite important here um

1612
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,119
and

1613
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,319
the nation state um

1614
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,680
is a kind of

1615
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,680
is is maybe identity driven and i kind

1616
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,280
of wonder if we just scale that down i

1617
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,559
was thinking scale down i was talking

1618
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,319
about the face there earlier but for

1619
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,359
instance

1620
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,559
the baby in the womb okay

1621
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,680
is the the release during

1622
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,400
childbirth of the hormones which

1623
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,680
triggers the woman to break her waters

1624
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,400
basically like a broadcast

1625
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,799
from the identity

1626
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,000
of the womb so okay body i'm here now

1627
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,400
i'm a child bearing womb

1628
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,160
i'm declaring myself

1629
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,839
in the same way that maybe the pituitary

1630
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,440
gland but it does it all the time

1631
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,200
declares itself

1632
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,280
certain times to crash out into you know

1633
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,559
create insulin so could we see that then

1634
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,480
this meshed architecture comes at a

1635
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,640
scale where it's possible once the you

1636
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,000
know and then it's like

1637
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,240
and in the same way then

1638
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,119
uh the nation state maybe as we go up in

1639
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,240
scale

1640
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,200
the expression of

1641
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,520
uh signifiers

1642
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,920
to broadcast out becomes greater and

1643
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,039
greater

1644
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,480
you know becomes a bigger and bigger

1645
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,480
part of it and maybe

1646
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,720
the biological

1647
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
processes become

1648
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,279
less a part of it

1649
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,960
well definitely it's the question of

1650
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,359
realism and instrumentalism whether it

1651
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,079
quote is a broadcast or whether we'll

1652
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,880
just choose to model it as

1653
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,720
so one of those is definitely safe

1654
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,760
territory and the other one is

1655
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,920
a little bit harder to make claims about

1656
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,680
what the territory is versus the map

1657
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,119
that we choose to draw around the

1658
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,480
territory

1659
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,480
um but very interesting

1660
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,440
points dean

1661
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,480
okay i'm one i just want to make sure

1662
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,079
that

1663
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,079
i'll get feedback from people on this so

1664
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,000
to me adaptation

1665
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,119
okay adaptation around what is

1666
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,440
which can be scale-free

1667
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,359
or if we're talking about active

1668
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,520
inference do we also include the counter

1669
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,119
factual what if

1670
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,559
and i think if we include the what if

1671
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,920
then

1672
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,359
i'm not sure

1673
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,920
that adaptation

1674
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,280
looks the same

1675
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,520
it's not reflective so i'm not pushing

1676
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,200
back on serval as much as i'm asking

1677
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,480
are we are we over fitting are we saying

1678
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,960
that recursion doesn't matter and are we

1679
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,920
saying

1680
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,760
that scale friendly doesn't matter

1681
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,319
because we only want to concentrate on

1682
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,640
what is

1683
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,680
that's my question

1684
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,680
dean i'll give it a thought then stephen

1685
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,558
and then anyone else

1686
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,640
active inference agents

1687
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,039
that are capable of doing adaptive

1688
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,440
active inference as a title so just a

1689
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,920
recently proposed word as serval brought

1690
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,640
up

1691
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,520
their internal generative model includes

1692
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,039
a model of

1693
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,960
perception and action

1694
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,440
as well as of cognition so that's

1695
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,680
metacognition

1696
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,960
the what is of metacognition at one

1697
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,480
level can be a what if at another level

1698
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,400
what is is

1699
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,280
the agent can actually be imagining a

1700
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,880
counter factual

1701
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,440
with respect to perception and action so

1702
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,880
cognition

1703
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,079
is that

1704
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,839
friendly scale

1705
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,640
it helps us bridge

1706
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,880
the what if and the what is

1707
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,440
because um there's als there's so many

1708
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,119
other angles one other path to walk

1709
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,760
through that would be like um in anil

1710
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,760
seth's book being you

1711
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,160
there's a great discussion about how

1712
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,760
counterfactuals actually are like the

1713
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,240
basis of cognition like

1714
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,440
how do we know that we're looking at a

1715
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,119
real mouse

1716
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,119
like on my computer table versus like a

1717
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,440
picture of one at the same resolution

1718
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,960
because actually there is an implicit

1719
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,280
counter factual i could move at a

1720
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,640
different angle

1721
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,160
and see something different the physical

1722
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,280
object but i wouldn't expect the shadows

1723
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,440
to move on this jpeg

1724
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,720
and so actually

1725
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,400
the difference in our perception between

1726
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,920
two things that visually can look

1727
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,720
identical relates to deep situational

1728
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,839
awareness that actually

1729
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,359
blur or at least

1730
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,599
reimagine the relationship between what

1731
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,359
is and what if

1732
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,920
stephen and then blue

1733
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,240
thanks actually this paper's serving as

1734
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,280
quite a useful bridging

1735
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,079
uh provocation um because as you just

1736
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,039
mentioned there daniel with them

1737
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,599
okay so what if you know way of what if

1738
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,119
and counterfactuals

1739
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,359
so there's there's the cognition which

1740
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,520
is a particular scale

1741
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,200
of perspectival

1742
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,000
or even implicit what if the counter

1743
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,520
factual but

1744
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,359
what if this and that happened in the

1745
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,680
future well the other question is

1746
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,680
what am i becoming

1747
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,599
and actually if we want to look at scale

1748
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,720
3

1749
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,760
if

1750
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
active inference is based on free energy

1751
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,240
principles and free energy principle was

1752
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,920
pretty much the only form of nonlinear

1753
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,680
dynamical system out there but now we've

1754
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,720
got some of the statistics stochastic

1755
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,680
chaos work um also

1756
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,520
um like if you go right back to

1757
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,400
non-linear dynamical systems and

1758
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,079
a lot of discussion around non-linear

1759
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,000
dynamical systems people are talking

1760
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,200
about thinking about that as a process

1761
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,799
of becoming

1762
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,839
so

1763
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,520
how because it gives you a way what

1764
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,440
dimensionality can use well the the

1765
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,680
process of becoming starts to

1766
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,960
tie into that

1767
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,400
um and

1768
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,880
cognition as we see it doesn't

1769
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,839
maybe the process of being

1770
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,680
is more approached of becoming but the

1771
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,079
process of what i broadcast if using

1772
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,599
that term very

1773
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,119
brutally but what my identity conveys

1774
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,720
is a much more

1775
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,720
steady much more of a

1776
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,760
an artifactual state if that makes sense

1777
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,760
especially if i take a photo of it and

1778
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,680
put it on my profile on facebook

1779
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,640
thank you um here's an article on being

1780
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,920
and becoming and that distinction as

1781
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,319
well as i'm sure a panoply of german

1782
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,280
words has been discussed for a long time

1783
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,799
about the relationship between being and

1784
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,000
becoming and

1785
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,960
just to give one thought before blue

1786
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,520
that generative model of the active

1787
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,039
agent includes what kind of agent am i

1788
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,039
what are my expectations preferences

1789
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,440
affordances etc so

1790
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,599
we get in the deep active inference

1791
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,559
framework built in

1792
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,799
what if and then what and then who would

1793
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,720
i be and how would others see me and

1794
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,480
what would they think if i were to do

1795
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,559
this and then this were to change that's

1796
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,720
all part of the state space of what's

1797
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,240
possible

1798
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,640
these are like the grammar in terms of

1799
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,039
the very austere outline of perception

1800
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,680
cognition action and external dynamics

1801
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,839
that allow composition

1802
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
and new design motifs for those kinds of

1803
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,920
questions to be asked

1804
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,640
blue

1805
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,559
so if you wouldn't mind flipping back to

1806
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,359
the twisty slide i think it's 33.

1807
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,839
um and when you're thinking about like

1808
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,359
are we talking about

1809
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,240
what is or are we also including the

1810
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,559
what ifs in the model like

1811
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,240
when we talk about what it's like to

1812
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,920
build a state

1813
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,479
so so this is like how states have been

1814
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,479
built before

1815
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,719
but but how can we like take this and

1816
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,960
like as as daniel was like referring to

1817
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,799
at the beginning of the talk like how

1818
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,080
can we take

1819
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,679
the what has been

1820
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,238
and incorporate like what if via active

1821
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,479
inference to predict

1822
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,679
like how to optimally optimally form

1823
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,640
states in the future so is active

1824
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,238
inference incorporating the counter

1825
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,640
factuals are we going into what-ifs or

1826
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,198
or like what about what's next like not

1827
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,520
just what if but but what's next to

1828
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,520
predict like the the cognition

1829
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,759
essentially of a state

1830
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,920
and how it's it's going to think going

1831
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,080
forward

1832
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,960
great

1833
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,520
question and what's next we can have our

1834
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,198
expectations is we can have our

1835
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,719
preferences

1836
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,439
they can interact in a different way so

1837
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,719
dean then andy

1838
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,040
yeah blue i think that ties in with the

1839
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,600
point twos that we tend to do

1840
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,920
all i would all i would

1841
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,479
all i would add to what's been said

1842
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,529
is that if if we're looking at as

1843
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,640
[Music]

1844
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,600
as is we're looking at this reflection

1845
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,960
and and can we ask off of that of what

1846
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,679
are we becoming of becoming which is a

1847
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,960
function sometimes of scale many times

1848
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,040
of variation

1849
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,759
so i know i keep beating this horse

1850
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,319
because i want to include the variation

1851
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,198
and the fact that time changes

1852
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,719
our picture

1853
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,880
that's that's all i want included in

1854
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,759
this

1855
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,238
and i don't think that that

1856
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:53,359
as

1857
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,440
is a perfect copy as we update

1858
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,480
so i maybe i'm maybe i'm explaining this

1859
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,080
wrong but i think as change occurs

1860
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,000
that perfect reflection that perfect

1861
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,080
copy doesn't move forward without

1862
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,440
variation

1863
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
concentration sometimes sometimes we

1864
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,159
just

1865
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,199
toss it out the window

1866
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,000
andy that's the what if sorry thank you

1867
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,280
dean andy and then i'll give a thought

1868
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,400
on that as change occurs

1869
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,360
so uh in my travels i've run across this

1870
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,600
idea that somebody tried to

1871
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,480
quantify functions of a state

1872
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,080
that are universal

1873
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
right what are the things like how do

1874
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,600
how do you maintain health care not

1875
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,520
necessarily which way is better but

1876
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,400
distribution of resources

1877
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,480
education health healthcare

1878
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,920
things that we associate with the state

1879
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,080
maybe not every one of them every state

1880
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,320
exists or every nation exists or let's

1881
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,080
stick with state maybe not every state

1882
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,520
does every one of them certainly not all

1883
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,520
of them do it to the same degree of

1884
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,520
competency and they are all bound within

1885
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,480
the expectations of the people who

1886
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,400
um comprise that

1887
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,960
that polity or that that entity

1888
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,880
but to get after your question blue

1889
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,360
right if we if we want to get to

1890
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,120
what if how is this different how does

1891
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,239
states form differently what is the

1892
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,600
optimal thing

1893
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,440
then i think you've got to get down to

1894
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,400
like um a core set of variables for

1895
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,159
which states are are

1896
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,679
supposed to

1897
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,360
uh provide

1898
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,719
solutions to

1899
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,400
or address

1900
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,679
um

1901
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,360
and then from there we can see well what

1902
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,880
if they did it this way what if if they

1903
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,960
prioritize this and not that what if

1904
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,120
they prioritize this function over that

1905
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,880
function and why would they right what

1906
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,320
are they responding to

1907
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
i don't think that they're responding to

1908
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,440
um

1909
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,440
necessarily uniquely physical or

1910
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,679
material requirements i think there's

1911
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,360
some interplay between

1912
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,239
um

1913
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,080
intellectual or

1914
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,920
values-based requirements as well as

1915
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,600
material requirements all mixed up in

1916
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,960
time and space

1917
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,840
given

1918
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,280
which parts of history we choose to

1919
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,560
preference

1920
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,880
in a particular moment

1921
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,080
thank you

1922
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,199
so one note on the as change occurs

1923
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,640
so

1924
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,880
here's a very influential

1925
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,280
book with a a broad

1926
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,760
follow-up lineage on the geometry of

1927
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,679
biological time by winfrey and it brings

1928
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,719
us back to the discussion of kairos and

1929
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,719
how change occurring

1930
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,400
in chronos

1931
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,440
we become like pro trustees we have to

1932
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,239
stretch and pull and change

1933
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:33,679
the sequence of action to fit onto

1934
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,880
the scale as defined whereas

1935
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,480
thinking about the space of action

1936
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,800
the geometry of biological time is

1937
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,640
defined more by action

1938
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,120
like embryological events rather than

1939
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,679
how many seconds have ticked on some

1940
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,239
atomic clock in some bunker

1941
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:53,199
so

1942
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,960
that um as change occurs

1943
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,960
can be through time but it may not be um

1944
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,480
the kind of time that gets ticked out on

1945
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,600
a clock

1946
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,440
and that's just a very different way to

1947
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,080
talk about actions and inference because

1948
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,800
it's dynamic but it's not just like okay

1949
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,000
the clock's running and things are

1950
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,159
changing it's like there's actually a

1951
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,080
timeliness to action and so we're

1952
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,000
talking about the dynamics of the

1953
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,080
context and the timeliness

1954
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,000
and then maybe there's ways to map

1955
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,840
kronos and kairos

1956
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,640
or maybe one time we play more into one

1957
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,920
or the other

1958
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,840
so dean and then anyone

1959
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,360
else yeah just real quick thank you andy

1960
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,719
because i think what you did is you

1961
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,800
applied a partition to preferences and

1962
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,880
priority and you made sure that we

1963
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,719
didn't say that they were one and the

1964
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,679
same

1965
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,640
and so in real time we we see we see an

1966
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,120
evolution

1967
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,040
throughout the discourse so i think

1968
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,920
that's

1969
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,920
that's a real example of what kind of

1970
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,040
happens as we update

1971
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,760
so one other random

1972
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,000
thought just from earlier and then of

1973
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,159
course anyone just bring up a thought or

1974
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,840
anyone in the live chat so we were

1975
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,320
talking earlier about like capital with

1976
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,600
the ol and capital with a l

1977
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
okay so this was pretty interesting

1978
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,679
capitol with an ol

1979
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,159
comes from capitolium the name of the

1980
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,159
temple of jupiter at rome on the

1981
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,920
capitoline hill

1982
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,199
so

1983
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,760
dating in english from the 14th century

1984
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,280
so that is referring to like this

1985
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,360
building that's like very much like city

1986
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,640
on a hill

1987
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,679
and um

1988
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,560
city on a hill is used as a multi-scale

1989
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,600
allusion

1990
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,480
to the united states at the very least

1991
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,800
um like capitol hill but of course

1992
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,040
broader notions of what

1993
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,159
the state stands for and then there's

1994
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,239
capital with a l

1995
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,480
capital on the other hand has a far

1996
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,560
wider range of meanings in application

1997
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,400
the word comes from latin as well from

1998
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,280
kaput meaning head

1999
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,800
and then it has a lot of um polycymous

2000
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,920
uses

2001
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,239
like capital punishment which we talked

2002
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,719
of being the seat of government

2003
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,120
like sacramento is the capital

2004
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,640
of

2005
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,640
california but then like venture capital

2006
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,560
capitalization

2007
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,440
so that's just interesting um

2008
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,159
i hope it's not simple word play when

2009
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,920
there's a homonym but it's very

2010
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,320
interesting that they both draw back to

2011
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
rome which was alluded to earlier when

2012
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,440
thinking about the seeds of what today's

2013
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,800
states are on the world stage so andy

2014
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,440
then stephen

2015
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,960
yeah sir

2016
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,120
would institutions of the state right

2017
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,520
like um ministry of foreign affairs can

2018
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,840
be considered an example of embodied

2019
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,960
intelligence

2020
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,679
in the context of cognition for

2021
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,840
the state

2022
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
yes

2023
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,960
something that blue said earlier

2024
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,960
is that

2025
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,120
people proposed a collective agency to

2026
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
be based on the ability of a certain

2027
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,480
kind of

2028
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,560
regime of her behavior

2029
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,440
to

2030
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,760
influence individual fitness

2031
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,840
what i would say is that

2032
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,239
this is wrong

2033
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,800
the biological organization it is by

2034
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,840
definition organization it

2035
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,480
is constraint that exists upon the

2036
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,640
collective behavioral system

2037
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,840
if you look at say its steel beam it is

2038
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,800
a structure it is something that affects

2039
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,880
how the steel beam

2040
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,520
interacts with the world

2041
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,120
and this is something that is entirely

2042
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,880
invisible from the perspective of a

2043
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,040
single particular steel which is the

2044
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,440
natural lower level

2045
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,040
lower scale

2046
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,280
perspective you can articulate

2047
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,960
so the view that

2048
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,679
organization is entailed by

2049
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,480
things that affect the niche of their

2050
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,679
constituents

2051
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,960
is flawed what organization is

2052
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,199
is a constraint at a specific scale and

2053
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,360
specific

2054
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,840
behavior on a specific dynamic

2055
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,159
and

2056
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,880
the relation it does

2057
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,080
with the body

2058
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,199
the body

2059
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,199
which

2060
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,960
certain uh certain schedules of

2061
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,480
cognition is about

2062
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,360
is uh the sets of those constraints uh

2063
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,760
that collectively enacts uh behavior

2064
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,760
that we say is cognitive

2065
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,040
so when a mystery of foreign affairs or

2066
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,960
something is

2067
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,719
doing a thing

2068
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,640
it is embodied in the sense that it

2069
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,199
participates uh in a greater network of

2070
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,920
constraints uh which collectively build

2071
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,360
organization

2072
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,320
uh

2073
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,239
which entail the behavior the specific

2074
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,199
h-specific decision of the um

2075
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,120
ministry of foreign policy so for

2076
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,560
example if

2077
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,520
there is some kind of

2078
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,360
collective

2079
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,000
panic moral panic against communism it's

2080
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,360
likely in the absence of any

2081
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,760
uh formal statement against communism

2082
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,560
that

2083
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,560
uh decision be taken by that this

2084
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,960
shouldn't be best against uh specific

2085
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,679
people and words and

2086
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,560
themes but urban needs communists

2087
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,040
and this is not entailed by anything at

2088
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,880
the formal level at the level of

2089
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,800
symbolic computation that

2090
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,280
could be construed as competing the

2091
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,679
highest or most

2092
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,239
recognizable forms of state cognition

2093
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,880
yet this participates in

2094
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,560
a collective behavior

2095
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,000
that's adapted

2096
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,080
from the border system

2097
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,840
this is basically the

2098
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,280
nation states distinction familiar

2099
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,400
the aggregate behavior of specific sets

2100
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,760
of

2101
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,920
constitution constraints

2102
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,560
past processes will build the strong

2103
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,080
processes and

2104
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,560
physical entire behavior and this is

2105
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,080
um

2106
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,920
not something that needs to be

2107
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,640
acknowledged from any higher level

2108
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,000
and this yes

2109
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,239
is uh cognition

2110
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,080
and this grounds of view of hemorrhagic

2111
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,960
recognition are something that

2112
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,960
follows states um as something that is

2113
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,080
uh grounded in not the body of any

2114
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,760
single individual but in the body of the

2115
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,840
state as

2116
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,520
the set of its consulting constraints

2117
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,520
thanks cerval i also put up a quote that

2118
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,320
people can pause the video and read from

2119
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
the gulag archipelago

2120
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,480
that specifically refers to

2121
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,360
organizations as organs of the state

2122
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,280
which is a little bit of a almost

2123
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,480
sinister meat grinder way to describe

2124
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,120
the state and it refers to this

2125
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,320
interplay between the awareness

2126
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,800
and the actions of individuals

2127
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,640
and the

2128
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,320
systems outcomes at the state level

2129
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,719
stephen

2130
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,760
yeah i think as well as

2131
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,440
this this is really useful i think this

2132
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,320
embodiment and our intuitive ability to

2133
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,920
embody

2134
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,760
um does then recapitulate

2135
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
the influence process

2136
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,080
so as well as these terms

2137
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,520
the seats of government or whatever

2138
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,920
coming from say we see it coming from

2139
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,400
roman literature but over time it's been

2140
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,639
encoded and encoded and maybe abstracted

2141
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,880
out and we use words and sometimes you

2142
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,960
have to look up the etymology to sort of

2143
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,960
find out where they came from but we we

2144
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,800
do intuitively see a difference if

2145
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,560
someone says someone's going to take

2146
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,480
their seat at the senate where you get a

2147
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,920
feel for that but you don't say they're

2148
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,320
going to take their seat at the palace

2149
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,360
they're going to take their they're

2150
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,480
going to they're going to sit in the

2151
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,080
throne right

2152
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,400
because the whole point of the palace is

2153
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,320
that those seats are not

2154
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,239
everyday seats right

2155
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,000
so there's there's a but you get that

2156
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,159
because of how you know space is treated

2157
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,920
around one of those seats

2158
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,360
like you don't you don't put a load of

2159
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,719
seats around

2160
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,040
and roll up a load of thrones you give

2161
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,440
space to it um and there's actually a

2162
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,040
lot of interesting work in physical

2163
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,480
theater where you literally can work

2164
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,760
with space

2165
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,239
to convey how much space you give

2166
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,360
someone

2167
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,320
will convey how much power they have

2168
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,000
that reminds me of

2169
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,239
the term meronym so that's like when you

2170
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,199
say

2171
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,280
there were 10 mouths to feed it's

2172
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,120
referring to a

2173
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,400
system

2174
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,719
by referring to the sub part of the

2175
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,040
system so it's kind of like marrow

2176
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,360
topology is about the parts and holes

2177
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,480
and neurology and so the meronym is when

2178
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,120
revealed through our language we say

2179
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,840
there were 20 seats on that committee

2180
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,040
um

2181
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,800
and the fluidity at which that is

2182
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,360
semantically unpacked

2183
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,199
shows that there is a relationship like

2184
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,480
when you say there was 20 mouths you

2185
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,400
think there was 20 people

2186
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,239
and that includes a lot of our

2187
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,800
assumptions um you know 10 pairs of

2188
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,120
hands or you know 10 hands

2189
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,960
what does that say about our assumptions

2190
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,760
about you know ableism or about what the

2191
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,199
default

2192
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:06,080
is

2193
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,400
in our um way of speaking like that

2194
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,840
stephen and then anyone else

2195
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,679
yeah uh

2196
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,760
and well ableism definitely comes in

2197
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,760
then as these these codes as people

2198
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,360
start to look at ableism that that's a

2199
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,639
very good point

2200
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,560
and also there's that intuitive

2201
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,120
understanding that you know there's the

2202
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,960
idea that a team

2203
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,880
generally is really more between five

2204
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,679
and ten people to optimally be a team

2205
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,679
and then you've got this idea of a group

2206
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,920
so you have an intuit when you hit 20

2207
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,960
you've gone past a small group into a

2208
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,719
large group and there's a whole work

2209
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,120
around large group interventions and

2210
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,320
getting

2211
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,920
aspects of the system in the room which

2212
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,400
is about when you can no longer

2213
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,639
look at each person in the eye and hold

2214
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,080
it which is sort of after 15 16 people

2215
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,080
so again you hit this

2216
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,159
to some extent

2217
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,239
we don't need to be taught that

2218
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,360
these things evoke

2219
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,320
the reality for us as this structured

2220
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,920
organism

2221
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,920
in space in place now it's probably

2222
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,800
different for a dog on four legs

2223
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,480
maybe they can only sniff around four

2224
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,239
dogs right and that's a big crowd for

2225
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,639
them so you know and is that about their

2226
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,560
mind or is that about their

2227
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,480
their morphology

2228
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,400
so is this definitely an interesting

2229
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,719
question

2230
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,880
thank you serval and then anyone else

2231
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,400
i like the way you talk of the throne as

2232
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,639
something that uh whose function is

2233
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,040
communicated through medically embodied

2234
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,320
um

2235
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,199
use

2236
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,320
because

2237
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,239
the community activity of the state is

2238
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,960
embarrassed in

2239
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,360
constraints that are not human but

2240
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,920
uh those constraints needs to somehow

2241
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,639
affect the behavior of humans of because

2242
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,520
those fact faster dynamics are basically

2243
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,840
the dynamics of a human individual they

2244
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
need ways to constrain it and influence

2245
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,480
it to exist as constraints

2246
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,840
and

2247
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,800
a major way they do so is by

2248
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,679
building the niche humans living

2249
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,639
so building the way humans

2250
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,920
embody their perceptions

2251
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,560
relate to each other to each other take

2252
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,560
decisions etc etc

2253
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,000
and

2254
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,480
to simply build a monumental

2255
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,320
architecture to convey that specific

2256
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,600
buildings have specific functions and

2257
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,920
are very important and that you have to

2258
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,040
understand the uh

2259
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,960
the underlying philosophy to exist as a

2260
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,199
functional member of society it's

2261
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,000
a way to do so and that's a way which

2262
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,560
the throne

2263
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,840
basically affects people to believe in

2264
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,199
the kind of exceptional

2265
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,520
qualities of the subbrain which are

2266
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,400
necessary for a state uh

2267
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,260
a state that has a sovereignty to exist

2268
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,719
[Music]

2269
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,840
so the throne in the crown or or any

2270
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,679
other kind of

2271
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,400
token there so it's um it's embodied it

2272
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,280
refers to a wearable or a bodily

2273
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,400
position

2274
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,280
it refers to of course in a cultured

2275
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,719
and a semiotic

2276
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,719
context

2277
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,400
it's enacted that relates to declarative

2278
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,080
speech acts

2279
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,639
i pronounce you married

2280
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:35,600
the speech act is

2281
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,400
the

2282
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,520
action

2283
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,960
and so when we're talking about writing

2284
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,400
and language driven systems

2285
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,320
which is a key part of again that that

2286
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
deep histories section

2287
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,719
declarative speech acts become very

2288
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,880
important when you're served the

2289
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,560
subpoena or when something is ruled then

2290
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,320
the hammer comes down on the table with

2291
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,159
like sort of like the finality of the

2292
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,520
act

2293
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,679
like an onomatopoeia relative to the

2294
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,040
declaration

2295
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,480
that was uttered

2296
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,040
in a certain ritualized context

2297
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,159
um

2298
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,880
these are great examples about

2299
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,400
how we can use like the 4e framework um

2300
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,360
and also i was going to say it's

2301
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,199
extended because the crown and the

2302
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,360
throne they're literally off of the body

2303
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,800
and then what's the story that's like

2304
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,480
the total um

2305
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,280
uh

2306
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,360
like oh king got owned

2307
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,280
emperor's new clothes

2308
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,719
where the extended cognitive apparatus

2309
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,360
that signals the cultural position of

2310
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,639
the king

2311
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:39,520
is revealed to be not

2312
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,960
what it is

2313
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,320
and so it's like

2314
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,040
to strip the person of their role it's

2315
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,440
just like stripping off their clothes

2316
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,239
and these are just all kinds of very

2317
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,239
accessible

2318
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,600
phenomena

2319
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,840
that we can ask

2320
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,159
how does this support

2321
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,760
a 4e

2322
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,239
or an active inference approach

2323
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,199
relative to some other approach like

2324
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,679
signal processing yeah i'm sure you can

2325
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,840
make the neural network that recognizes

2326
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,480
a crown versus other images

2327
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,520
but

2328
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,000
that is like a sub-component of visual

2329
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,360
perception

2330
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,239
within this broader picture

2331
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,600
and then also it helps us ask um what if

2332
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,760
and how we could design

2333
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,800
embodied and cultured enacted extended

2334
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,000
etc

2335
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,120
systems

2336
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,400
that reflect

2337
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,120
the statistical regularities of who we

2338
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,400
are now and how we think things are

2339
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,080
and how we expect and preferred things

2340
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,239
to change

2341
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,159
yeah i i think that's a very good point

2342
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,600
and

2343
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,480
maybe this is where

2344
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,560
you know the survivor was talking about

2345
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,320
constraints there and also i suppose it

2346
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,320
comes back to the idea of when to stop

2347
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,520
i'm talking i talked about this a little

2348
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,520
bit with dean uh yes

2349
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,920
yesterday is um when do we know when to

2350
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,080
stop is one of the big challenges about

2351
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,880
you know ecological context

2352
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,760
and i keep thinking so you know you have

2353
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,920
the hammer comes down you know if you

2354
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,280
have a state you know the hammer comes

2355
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,719
down it

2356
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,880
you you you viscerally have an embodied

2357
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,080
understanding of what's being

2358
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,760
communicated by then

2359
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,440
you know that comes down something's

2360
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,080
been hammered out and in the houses of

2361
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,560
parliament in the uk they have this big

2362
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,719
mace they call it the mace it's an

2363
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,960
ornament an ornamental mace but of

2364
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,639
course amazed well i don't know if this

2365
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,800
is exactly true but i i think the mace

2366
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,639
normally as something you club someone

2367
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,800
at the head with right in a battle right

2368
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,520
so

2369
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,000
it's there as maybe that that big stick

2370
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,040
con idea that's been brought in but why

2371
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,639
one thing that really came to mind when

2372
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,719
i was when this was coming up was what

2373
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,040
happened during nazi germany

2374
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,239
when the new technology of sound systems

2375
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:01,679
came out so the big thing that happened

2376
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,360
was these big rallies that completely

2377
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,760
overwhelm people is no one had had just

2378
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,199
like we didn't have with social media

2379
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,199
before no one had had an embodied

2380
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,600
experience to calibrate

2381
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,199
and in some ways you maybe never can

2382
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:14,960
because it becomes slightly beyond the

2383
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
concepts of embodiment

2384
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,120
what it meant to be in this big

2385
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,280
arena where you heard sound coming from

2386
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,239
everywhere

2387
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,360
and it then the idea is that that was

2388
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,560
part of the reason why it became

2389
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,320
disruptive maybe

2390
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,560
we weren't able to constrain and it just

2391
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,960
became over a cancerous almost overwhelm

2392
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,080
but there's something about new

2393
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,840
technologies and the ability to

2394
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,800
constrain and find a state

2395
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,239
that is

2396
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,159
to some extent

2397
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,520
sustainable

2398
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,600
um and when it becomes out of control

2399
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,520
and is there something about the

2400
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,520
embodiment that daniel was talking about

2401
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,840
there

2402
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,719
thank you steven serval and then anyone

2403
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,880
else

2404
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,719
so i want to emphasize that uh as

2405
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,120
in their formalism i'm a cleaner too the

2406
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,120
the constraint is not

2407
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,600
um does not entail the notion of an

2408
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,480
interdiction of a tap down order or of

2409
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,718
um

2410
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,480
of a stop on a behavior a constraint is

2411
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,639
a through slow process that modulates

2412
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,120
that modulates a fast process

2413
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,560
for example if we agree on the sound of

2414
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,239
some word say a lamp

2415
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,800
so we have a relatively slow process

2416
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,199
that is our couple behavior that will

2417
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,719
constrain our

2418
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:39,840
relative faster processes in the sense

2419
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
that when one of us

2420
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,000
use the word lamp the other will

2421
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,800
understand what it refers to so it will

2422
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,120
basically lower

2423
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,800
the dimensionality of the possible

2424
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,960
behavior i have because i will only pick

2425
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,679
behavior that are consistent with with

2426
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,239
the fact that you said the word lamp as

2427
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,959
i understand it

2428
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,080
so the way that we culturally build our

2429
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,280
niches

2430
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,239
um

2431
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,600
it's not

2432
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,480
uh

2433
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,760
something we understand as constraining

2434
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,480
it's something we understand as creative

2435
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,960
and yet it corresponds potentially to

2436
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,400
the um

2437
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,120
the concept of constraint as would be

2438
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,239
used by a physicist or stem biologist

2439
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:27,120
which is the sense i use in that

2440
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,660
paper

2441
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,320
[Music]

2442
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,159
thanks

2443
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,719
it reminds me of a paper could find it

2444
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,880
with like uh it was like developmental

2445
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,840
constraints or opportunities

2446
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,600
and it was just saying you can think

2447
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,760
about like okay i guess there's some

2448
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,840
morphological creature that just extends

2449
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,120
in a blob

2450
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,239
but any other one that has facilitated

2451
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,800
enabled affordances to grow in one

2452
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,480
direction

2453
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,320
can be framed as the constraints from

2454
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,960
the other dimension and so there are two

2455
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,320
sides of the coin to talk about what is

2456
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,480
the constraint that enables it's like

2457
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,440
chess

2458
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,360
it's the enabling constraints on chess

2459
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,960
moves that allow

2460
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,120
brilliant chess games and a culture to

2461
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,480
actually arise

2462
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,159
so survival with the direct response

2463
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,480
then stephen and blue

2464
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,600
yeah thank you

2465
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,520
uh i think blue uh

2466
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,159
other hand at first i mentioned uh but

2467
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:25,040
what i wanted to say is that um

2468
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,120
to have something that exists as a

2469
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,800
meaningful concept to have interesting

2470
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,840
behavior

2471
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,520
uh you need essential breakings for

2472
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,880
example you need

2473
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,520
a particular gas to not be independent

2474
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,360
the default assumption of a physicist is

2475
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,880
that

2476
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,600
nothing everything depends on nothing

2477
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,760
each particle evolve independently

2478
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,880
essentially

2479
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,679
so

2480
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,679
this means that i need basically

2481
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,600
the mean and the variance of their

2482
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,840
individual trajectories to

2483
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,840
to have all of the insert information on

2484
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,400
my system uh this correspond uh to like

2485
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,920
pressure and temperature and depending

2486
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,960
on

2487
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,960
what the trajectory is

2488
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,040
um

2489
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,280
well this there is no claimation

2490
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,520
actually uh whatever

2491
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,400
uh

2492
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:17,840
but if i uh somehow uh forbids um

2493
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,840
if i somehow build

2494
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,000
a collection between the behavior of

2495
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,159
those particles then

2496
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,920
there are new possible behavior but

2497
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,639
emerge you have new possible elements of

2498
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,159
this dead space

2499
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,520
that exist you have a creation

2500
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,800
as far as a physicist that is concerned

2501
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,679
with behavior within certain species

2502
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,199
um is

2503
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,000
as far as uh by phrase but the physicist

2504
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,920
sees question because there are things

2505
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,000
that were not part of the set base he

2506
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,320
drew at the beginning of this system

2507
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,440
that become an existence

2508
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,840
something that was not in that

2509
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,760
now is

2510
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,400
and what is interesting is this process

2511
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,520
of becoming

2512
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,040
us i don't know who uh as we discussed

2513
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,400
earlier

2514
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,880
uh because uh you have kinds of

2515
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,719
symmetries building and symmetry

2516
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,360
spracking that are constructive and yet

2517
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,600
they need to be constraining because if

2518
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,639
everything just arbitrarily adopts any

2519
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:19,600
kind

2520
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,760
of behavior in the space that is

2521
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,080
accessible that is possible in principle

2522
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,600
you have just a philanthropy you have

2523
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,920
what noise you have literally nothing

2524
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,880
there you have just particles that

2525
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,040
blah

2526
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,159
and

2527
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,239
the facts uh

2528
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,320
of existence that we have things to talk

2529
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,800
about it entails uh the concerning of

2530
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,040
the possible space to

2531
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,400
everything is acrylically to some

2532
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,080
of the things are more likely and

2533
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,519
it entails a meaningful map

2534
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,239
between the possible

2535
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,639
states at the macro level at the

2536
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,400
lowest possible level of description

2537
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,480
and the states as

2538
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,679
we are interested in in a specific uh at

2539
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,679
a specific moment

2540
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,800
so thank you i was uh writing on the way

2541
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,280
that constraints are not restrictive but

2542
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,119
creative

2543
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:18,000
thank you the absence of restraints

2544
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,760
statistically constraints would just

2545
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,280
refer to you know an unconnected

2546
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,560
bayesian graph

2547
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,280
just independently vibrating

2548
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,320
variables

2549
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,400
and so to have anything that's tracking

2550
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,320
or anticipating something else

2551
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,560
we're discussing the imposition of

2552
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,840
constraints using that term stephen and

2553
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,560
then andy

2554
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,800
you mentioned i said daniel you put that

2555
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,080
enabling systems uh slash constraints so

2556
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,040
i think

2557
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,080
um

2558
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,239
there is that i i totally get and i

2559
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,679
think it's a very good point about you

2560
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,440
know you've got the statistics

2561
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,040
stochastic chaos and you've got the

2562
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,440
general dynamical processes and there's

2563
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,400
there's going to be some way of

2564
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,239
constraining that through different

2565
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,280
levels

2566
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,760
um there's also then

2567
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,920
uh you know if we take consciousness as

2568
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,080
being at the break the brain stem and

2569
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,880
not in the frontal cortex you know

2570
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,360
and it's then sending stuff out

2571
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,000
you know i can see that biological

2572
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,639
dynamic but you also have this enabling

2573
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,600
system process of scale i suppose that

2574
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,679
in a way i was just referring to and

2575
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:24,560
these things can start to be like the

2576
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,639
the ball rolling down the hill so to

2577
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:27,600
speak

2578
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,280
you know it starts to accumulate

2579
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,480
its own

2580
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,960
because it doesn't need to extract

2581
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,320
information

2582
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,480
to make inferences to make things happen

2583
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,840
it's just happening through

2584
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,639
thermodynamics and dynamics

2585
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,440
so um i wonder how

2586
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,480
we can think about the challenge of

2587
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,360
these macro systems then

2588
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,360
the enabling system overriding the

2589
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,560
emerging

2590
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,360
dynamical system

2591
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,320
thank you

2592
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,719
andy

2593
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,320
is there a fundamental difference

2594
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,239
between thinking like a state and

2595
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,000
thinking like a tribe or is it just a

2596
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,760
level of sophistication

2597
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,239
um with what specialties are are enabled

2598
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:17,119
once you get a state level

2599
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,679
thanks for the question sir states

2600
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,679
states has administrative systems as a

2601
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,199
tribe does not

2602
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,960
uh so

2603
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,400
like you are

2604
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,600
a lot of ways societies can be organized

2605
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,400
that are uh somewhat in a continuum

2606
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,119
and what i call a state is a specific uh

2607
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:38,239
control system that well is in a

2608
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:41,119
precipitatory state either it exists or

2609
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,280
it does not

2610
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,520
and in the case of uh

2611
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,040
tribes i don't think um

2612
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,360
most of what we call tribe of an

2613
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
integrated decision system more like

2614
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,000
shared

2615
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,920
ethnic

2616
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,000
cultural norms

2617
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,239
and if they have intuitive decision

2618
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:05,280
systems it's certainly nothing like uh

2619
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,920
administration

2620
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,960
it's so fascinating because the tribe

2621
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,800
can be implicitly existing without a

2622
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,679
state as cerval just noted

2623
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,440
and it makes me think about

2624
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,760
web 3 and taos where it's almost like

2625
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,560
the states are being defined first and

2626
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,360
then the people are rushing in to fill

2627
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,560
so instead of the historical emergence

2628
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,199
of specialization and elaboration

2629
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,080
and

2630
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,840
formalization on top of an implicit

2631
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
background of the people

2632
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,080
and then in a complex interplay as we've

2633
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,320
been discussing this is almost like a

2634
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,119
computational state that people are

2635
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,199
migrating to

2636
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,119
with a preset governance system

2637
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:50,719
sometimes one that's incredibly

2638
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,239
constraining and people may not even

2639
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,560
know how constraining

2640
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,000
until they're there

2641
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,400
so that's an inversion

2642
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,679
of

2643
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:01,199
how we've seen

2644
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,320
the um members of the state and the

2645
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,440
state's evolution engage so more things

2646
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,280
change the more they stay the same but

2647
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,760
it's a different river for sure so dean

2648
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,560
blue stephen

2649
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
i think i found something that i can

2650
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,280
i can say i can agree with

2651
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,000
with

2652
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,480
serval and and maybe some of the people

2653
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,440
who really like genetics because i

2654
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,760
i think constraint really matters and i

2655
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,119
i think the idea that ratio

2656
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:34,320
is not phenotypical drift through

2657
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,440
uh neutral mutations even though

2658
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,000
mutations are a ratio of the

2659
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,600
non-mutations

2660
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,840
i also think that ratios and randomness

2661
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,280
accommodations

2662
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,880
are not the same thing so i think

2663
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,639
constraint

2664
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,480
allows us to be able to see the

2665
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,360
difference between those two things

2666
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,159
one is when a triangle is a triangle and

2667
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,400
the other is when a variation plays upon

2668
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,639
a variation and i think we can accept

2669
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,600
both

2670
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,360
that's what i think the constraint piece

2671
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,880
actually helps us

2672
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,600
pull the two things together

2673
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,600
i thank you dean blue then stephen

2674
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,000
so just to kind of go back to what um

2675
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,760
andy was saying about the difference

2676
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,639
between a tribe and a state but also

2677
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:19,440
like

2678
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,560
when do we know when to stop um and

2679
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,119
processes that that constrain and when i

2680
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,440
think about this like bi-directional

2681
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,119
information flow

2682
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:31,760
like if the emergent energy is too

2683
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,880
strong

2684
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,280
like it then it's out of control right

2685
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,280
there's no constraint but but like when

2686
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,440
the constraint is too strong like i

2687
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,119
think about like you know even in mental

2688
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,119
action the idea that like you have your

2689
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,520
grip is too tight and so like what

2690
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,800
whatever you're trying to control like

2691
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,800
pops out of your grip right like so like

2692
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,800
you can squeeze a balloon and then boom

2693
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,199
um and so there has to be like some

2694
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:54,560
balance and i just wonder if that

2695
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,280
balance is like quantifiable like does

2696
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,199
downward information have to equal

2697
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:01,280
upward information flow like

2698
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,840
is there like a balance between those

2699
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,639
two things that allows like a

2700
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,280
self-emergent or not a self-organizing

2701
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,000
entity to maintain in the state of an

2702
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,440
attractor because if like the

2703
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,360
information flow is too much in one way

2704
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,480
or the other

2705
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,360
the balance goes off and it it'll steer

2706
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,080
away from that attractor space

2707
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,840
steven and then i'll add a comment on

2708
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,239
that blue

2709
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,960
yeah i think that there's the the

2710
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,199
ability to constrain

2711
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,840
is going to be at different levels in in

2712
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,199
the state

2713
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,560
you've got certain things which are just

2714
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,520
like

2715
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,360
constitutional you hear this in the

2716
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,040
states there's constitutional rights

2717
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,639
right they're fixed they can't change

2718
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,000
it's been there for 200 years or

2719
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,080
whatever and then you've got more

2720
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,880
negotiation and in the uk you've got the

2721
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,159
government has to go and talk to the

2722
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:52,000
queen every couple of weeks or every

2723
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,480
week so in theory the queen could

2724
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,520
constrain now again they don't just have

2725
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,040
to send a letter they have to go and

2726
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,440
meet in person and talk there has to be

2727
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,840
so then there's this inter-subjective

2728
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,480
dynamical constraint and then of course

2729
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,880
then for scaling you've got the kind of

2730
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,239
we can't really do it as organisms so we

2731
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,920
put in an electoral system but the

2732
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,679
electoral system

2733
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,920
and the the democracy in north america

2734
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,400
comes a lot from the tribe that the the

2735
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,480
sort of scaled tribes of north america

2736
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,480
as much as it does from france it's

2737
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,679
quite interesting and one thing they

2738
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,520
have in toronto we have the treaty of

2739
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,920
the dish of one spoon and the treated

2740
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,840
disher one spoon is basically they sat

2741
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,880
round

2742
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,719
in a circle and they have a spoon they

2743
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,320
have a dish with one spoon and you only

2744
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,239
take enough for yourself and you leave

2745
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,719
enough for nature and it's past rounds

2746
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,800
and that's the treaty of how to look

2747
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,639
after the great lakes

2748
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,239
and actually it was a lot of that kind

2749
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:46,880
of

2750
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,280
slightly scaled version of tribal work

2751
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,159
which then informed and said okay

2752
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,239
europe you're killing each other all the

2753
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,239
time what about something a little bit

2754
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:57,440
like this

2755
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,080
so actually a democracy in the u.s was

2756
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,639
partly from the euro

2757
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:04,719
not really tribes anymore but that kind

2758
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,920
of scaled peace so i think um

2759
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,360
there's there's

2760
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,679
there's that need to sort of draw back

2761
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,920
into something which is more contextual

2762
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,239
more dynamical um as well as the kind of

2763
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,400
i don't know the more kind of

2764
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,280
law based approach

2765
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,040
thank you so people have been mentioning

2766
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,520
the getting a grip which was of course

2767
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,480
from the

2768
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,440
paper

2769
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,080
about how states get a grip on their

2770
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,880
subjects and that was drawn from the

2771
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,600
work of of yella and ritfield

2772
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,159
talking about optimal grip and

2773
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,840
skilled performance and all these other

2774
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,800
cool

2775
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,639
inactive and ecological psychological

2776
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,639
ideas we've talked to so it's like of

2777
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,480
all the trajectories that the golf club

2778
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,920
can take

2779
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,000
we're constraining that to some lower

2780
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,080
dimensional manifold that's getting a

2781
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,199
grip

2782
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:58,000
and i totally agree i think a good

2783
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,560
example of an empirical system

2784
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,000
and about

2785
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
what kind of reciprocal interactions

2786
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,560
exist and what attractor states does

2787
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,159
that beget

2788
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,719
uh is the federalist anti-federalist

2789
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,520
discussion at the end of the 1700s in

2790
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,199
the united states

2791
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,280
with people saying if you have the

2792
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,440
affordance for a standing army at the

2793
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,800
federal scale

2794
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,960
then we'll see this happen at the lower

2795
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,679
state level or if there's the ability to

2796
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,520
engage in foreign diplomacy or print

2797
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,679
debt at the federal level

2798
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:31,760
then we'll see this happen or not at the

2799
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,960
state level and so i think that's where

2800
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,880
we go from sort of the

2801
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,159
what has been and what is to the future

2802
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,159
that we don't know about the what-if

2803
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,360
where

2804
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,639
we are in that scale-friendly

2805
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,800
level where we're talking about

2806
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,920
designing

2807
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,679
or modifying or perturbing or

2808
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,600
intervening in

2809
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,520
those causal threads that do link

2810
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,440
and co-constrain

2811
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,719
the smaller sub-units with the larger

2812
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,159
processes

2813
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:04,960
and

2814
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,239
how do we

2815
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:09,360
talk about the space of design there

2816
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,520
and integrate our preferences and

2817
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,119
expectations

2818
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,960
together with just

2819
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,840
sometimes the um

2820
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,400
dazzling and tragic

2821
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,119
and complex history of just

2822
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:27,119
everything we see on this map

2823
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:32,400
so we'll have just um a few minutes left

2824
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,719
let's from anyone who would like to

2825
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,480
let's just hear like some last thoughts

2826
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,719
what's something cool from today or

2827
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:41,840
what's something that you're looking

2828
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,960
forward to discussing more next week and

2829
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,719
otherwise it's been an awesome

2830
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,199
dot one so stephen and then we'll go

2831
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:52,159
around to anyone else

2832
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,719
yeah following on what you were saying

2833
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,480
there daniel and i'll use this as a sum

2834
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,239
up it slightly opens up a new thing

2835
01:45:58,239 --> 01:45:59,520
which maybe we'll get to the next

2836
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,880
session but

2837
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,199
you know how do we see what happens with

2838
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,159
the nature of tech companies and the

2839
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,080
huge affordances that that puts into our

2840
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,000
landscape

2841
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,159
also the constraints if we take the

2842
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:14,719
mcluhan tetrad of how it then changes

2843
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,880
the way we behave overall

2844
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,639
they're introducing

2845
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:19,920
rather than

2846
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,239
um a constraining

2847
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:23,679
or a

2848
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,040
sort of a wise constraining way

2849
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,880
it's it's putting out there what's out

2850
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,679
there and it's it's affording huge

2851
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,600
amounts of new

2852
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,320
novel interactions be it microsoft be it

2853
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,679
google be it

2854
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,360
facebook

2855
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,760
and then they're getting hugely

2856
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,080
powerful just through

2857
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,280
permeation into society so uh you know

2858
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,119
something that's interesting is then

2859
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,639
where does

2860
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,400
you know i think that may reflect one of

2861
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,159
the challenges we have at the moment

2862
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,239
with corporations getting so big

2863
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,000
so thank you and this is a very very

2864
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,360
good talk and

2865
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,960
lots of things are sparking off it so i

2866
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,400
appreciate it

2867
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,239
thank you yeah like

2868
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:05,920
nation states used to be like states

2869
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,400
were the big players in town

2870
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,520
there was big ones and there were

2871
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,679
smaller ones but that was sort of like

2872
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,840
the ultimate level of analysis

2873
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,040
web 2

2874
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,239
we saw

2875
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:20,320
websites stock tickers apple amazon etc

2876
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,719
become bigger than many states and

2877
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,800
intertwined and amongst them in a way

2878
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,440
that sometimes is even more advantageous

2879
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,440
though they don't have citizenships

2880
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,000
themselves they have user identifiers

2881
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,600
they have revenue flows they have

2882
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,280
governance models

2883
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,800
and then now

2884
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,560
into web3 we go

2885
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,280
and platforms and protocols maybe even

2886
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,440
decentralized ways

2887
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,760
of accumulating governance and economic

2888
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,800
systems

2889
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,320
that will also

2890
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,040
be

2891
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,400
at least initially

2892
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,880
larger than smaller nation states and

2893
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,280
web to tech companies so there's gonna

2894
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,480
be like

2895
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,480
legacy like web zero one two three four

2896
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,920
all of these

2897
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,400
systems are going to be

2898
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,080
on the same territory

2899
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,840
but they're going to have different maps

2900
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,080
so they're going to be coordinating

2901
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,800
very differently

2902
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,400
um would anyone else like to give a

2903
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,600
closing

2904
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,280
thought i think there's a lot of stuff

2905
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,040
in the dot too that we'll be able to

2906
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:24,000
like jump off into like survival next

2907
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,280
week i want to

2908
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,360
hear about where we go next like what

2909
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,679
are your next personal research

2910
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,760
goals and what are other

2911
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,000
opportunities for individuals who want

2912
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,159
to like learn more or research or apply

2913
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,000
in this area or under this framework

2914
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,280
blue and then anyone else

2915
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,040
so just a final thought i'd like to like

2916
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,199
discuss more or maybe get more into like

2917
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,280
what is the state anticipating i mean

2918
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,840
how do they anticipate uh what's coming

2919
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,760
next just predictive behavior

2920
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,719
yeah and it will be fun also to like

2921
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,360
just connect some of these to

2922
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,440
the core terms in the active in

2923
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,840
anthology just like what are the sense

2924
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,679
states of the states what are the action

2925
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,000
states of the states

2926
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,080
let's you know what is attention is that

2927
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,400
the most wanted list

2928
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,920
what are the ways that we can just take

2929
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,599
the terms that we already have and start

2930
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:19,199
to build up this table of mappings

2931
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,520
so that we can and maybe it's gonna fit

2932
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,360
on multiple levels so it's not gonna be

2933
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,040
just the one and only

2934
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,480
map of maps but it'll be a draft

2935
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,880
versionable participatory set of

2936
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,560
mappings and that'll be fun

2937
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,639
dean

2938
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,800
yeah what i really appreciated about the

2939
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,119
paper was the ability to sort of look at

2940
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,599
things through the scale in variance

2941
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:43,840
lens and now i'm really curious to see

2942
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,000
what would happen if we got off the map

2943
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,679
it started moving around and then

2944
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,480
actually incorporated scale variants

2945
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,239
because i think that's really the and

2946
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:54,639
then what happens piece that this paper

2947
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,239
of paper forwards it gives us a good

2948
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:58,400
grounding and now we can step off of

2949
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,920
that and see

2950
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,239
to think in the hypothetical space i'm

2951
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,280
really curious to see where that goes

2952
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,679
excellent

2953
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:11,280
andy if you have any last comments

2954
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,440
well thanks for letting me play i really

2955
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,599
enjoyed the conversation

2956
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,080
um and a lot of this was new to me right

2957
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,320
i'm new to the even the idea of active

2958
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,159
inference but being able to discuss it

2959
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,560
in concepts of the state uh

2960
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,840
incredibly interesting so thanks for

2961
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,520
letting me participate

2962
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,719
excellent well it's always a two or more

2963
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,199
way street so we all had an awesome time

2964
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:34,960
thank you everybody for

2965
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,719
participating we hope to see you here

2966
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,679
and or participants through listening

2967
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:44,719
in another live stream in the lab

2968
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:46,960
working with us on projects so

2969
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,400
see you all later talk to you next time
