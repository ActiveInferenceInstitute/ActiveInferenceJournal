00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
welcome to the actin flab everyone

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
we are a participatory online lab that

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
is communicating and mute if you're not

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
going to be speaking thank you we're a

10
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
participatory online lab that is

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,719
at the links here on this slide

14
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,879
this is a recorded and an archived live

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,799
stream so please provide us all with

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
feedback so that we can improve our work

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
welcome here

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
we'll be following good video etiquette

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
for live streams and respecting our

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,040
awesome facilitator blue

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
at this short link you can find the

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
streams past and upcoming and we are

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
about to be heading into the second half

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
of november 2021 where on the 23rd and

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
the 30th we'll have two participatory

27
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
group discussions on this very paper

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,759
we're going to discuss today thinking

29
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,960
like a state

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
and then we have yet to set the december

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
papers so if you know someone who might

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
be interested in joining or you yourself

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
would like to discuss a paper of yours

34
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
get in touch with us

35
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,280
today in active stream 33.0 the goal is

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
to learn and discuss this paper thinking

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,200
like a state

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
embodied intelligence in the deep

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
history of our collective minds by aval

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,119
guinin kalu

41
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
and the video like all

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
zero videos even though we do have the

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,879
author here it's just an introduction to

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,480
some of the ideas

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
and how to pronounce them not a review

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
or a final word so we'll introduce

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
ourselves and then go into aims and

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,760
claims abstract and roadmap

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
keywords figures and formalisms etc so

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
let us know especially if you'd like to

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
participate in the upcoming 33.1 and

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,200
33.2

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,160
we'll start with just an introduction of

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
saying hello and what we're excited to

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,599
talk about or resolve either in the dot

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,519
zero or in the upcoming group

57
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,640
discussions

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
and then we'll culminate with the author

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
and transfer facilitation over

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,720
so

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
california

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,959
and

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
i'm just excited to

65
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,599
check in on the progress of this

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
important topic people have been

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
theorizing about societies and cities

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,480
and states and everything in between

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
since as long as they were there

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
probably a little bit before

71
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
so it's just a fun topic and i'm really

72
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
excited to see how active inference can

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
give a new lens at resolving some of the

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
long-standing questions in that area

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,359
i'll pass it to stephen

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
yeah thank you daniel um

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
i'm steve and i'm based in toronto and

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,040
uh

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,840
i'm really interested in the multi-scale

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,519
implications of

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
state and

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,200
niche construction particularly for me

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
because i'm interested in working around

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
what i call social topographies which is

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
probably at the scale of

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
events and moments in people's like

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
lived experience and in their

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,080
architectures and places so i i'm really

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
excited that this is bringing in this

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
idea of state

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
and larger scale but also bridging that

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,840
with

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
active inference from the kind of

94
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
faster smaller scale so yeah lots of

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
good stuff here lots of ontological

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,159
questions as well which i think is

97
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,200
really cool

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,079
um and uh i passed it over should i pass

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,959
it over to blue blue or sharp yep over

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,479
to you

101
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
so i'm blue i'm an independent research

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
consultant in new mexico and i really

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,759
like this paper

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,000
and i really like working and talking

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
with avell about ideas because these

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
ideas are kind of at a bigger scale

107
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
i am interested in self-assembly of

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
things like at the cellular and maybe

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
even subcellular level and like this

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
takes it to the very big level and i

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
think that active inference really kind

112
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
of unifies this it's a skill-free

113
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
framework and so that's kind of what i'm

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,680
excited to talk about today and maybe

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
not resolve but discuss and get some

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
other perspectives on um and i'll pass

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
it to the first author of the paper or

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
the only author of the paper avail if

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
you'd like to just introduce yourself

120
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
say a few words

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,199
so i'm

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,199
available

123
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
i have a training in collective science

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,400
and physics mainly i'm interested in

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,759
philosophy and a lot of things

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
what we learned here is that i funded

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,440
and helped organize cairo's research

128
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
participative citizens laboratory which

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
aim is to understand

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,880
how to act or to navigate

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
contemporaries and show historical

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,919
dynamics

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,160
and part of this is to understand

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,479
why we have states and

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
how those states that we now have are

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,080
like

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,960
um

138
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
so the goal of the paper is to basically

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
understand how states have constituted

140
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
and what it tells about their continued

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,560
structural identity through ages and

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
this

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
of course the topic is big there are

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
several kind of states but the very

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
first thing we need to do is to

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
understand what your state is

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
and where it comes from and that's what

148
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
i'm trying to do there

149
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
awesome so moving on to the aims and

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
claims of the paper

151
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
uh so this paper thinking like a state

152
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
embodied intelligence in the deep

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,759
history of our collective mind

154
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,280
in the paper it states that the core

155
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
argument of this article is that states

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
can be and should be understood as

157
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,759
hierarchical control systems essentially

158
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,280
similar in their core physical

159
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
architecture to brains

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
and we will leverage active inference to

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
ground the study of intelligence in the

162
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
way an organism maintains their

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
structural autonomy to formally assess

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
the collective brain hypothesis

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
and the big question of the article

166
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
is what kind of intelligence is

167
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,479
displayed by city-state systems

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,720
and how is it embodied in their

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
structure

170
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
so we'll go through the abstract daniel

171
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
do you want to take the first section of

172
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,919
the abstract

173
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
yeah stephen first

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,639
oh just one comment just because i know

175
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,599
you mentioned kairos there and

176
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
i've done an activity with the kairos

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
blanket

178
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
or it's like a mapping

179
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
thing where you stand on parts of canada

180
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
and to look where it came from so i

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
don't that connects to i if i'm writing

182
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,000
you kairos is

183
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
working at that kind of regional

184
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
national scale to look at

185
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
questions around that and

186
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
from what i hear that's informing

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
how your research is

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,960
being approached is that correct

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,879
i did not understand the question um

190
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
not correct

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
yeah it was an activity it's an activity

192
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,919
actually not to do with a fristen

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
blanket literally where they put a big

194
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,520
blanket um about

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,720
parts of canada on the floor in a room

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
and then people have to stand on it and

197
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
they keep taking away bits

198
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
which were basically um

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
which which were not are no longer

200
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
in the territories of the first nations

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
and then you see how much is left

202
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
there's not a lot left

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
so to speak so it's talking to that idea

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,599
of statehood and

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
settlers and how much is left and i

206
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
wonder if that speaks to the wider work

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
of kairos and

208
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
questions of states and how do we

209
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
understand how we fit into that or maybe

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
i'm i'm mis

211
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,919
misunderstanding

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
so that fits in the work of keros

213
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
because it uh tries to bridge scales

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
i never heard of these keras broadcast

215
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
this is not related to what we do in any

216
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
environment it helps embody an

217
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
impression of how well settlers have

218
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,760
appropriated

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
indigenous american territories so this

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
is something that's

221
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
called that fits the mandate of karus

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
but the core

223
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
idea of keroses

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
it's the greek notion uh for time for

225
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
three in a greek and carlos is the

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,480
instant uh and it's uh coded

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
actively like it's an instant where you

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
can see the opportunity

229
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
and um this is basically what embodied

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,279
agents do they build skills and they

231
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
build capabilities and they enact them

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
when it separates this is the goal of

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
chaos to understand and reproduce uh

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
this uh core ability and

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
a lot of people have used kerosene you

236
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
have anarchists

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
that claim um that are called cairos you

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
have a christian concept that is called

239
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
cairos you have a lot of people that

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
make the use of the concept because it's

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
very broad and it's very um

242
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
it's not something that has been

243
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
imported in the

244
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
christian concept of times really in

245
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
like what you have today so if you want

246
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,440
to talk about this you use you just use

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
the greek word which is kairos so

248
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
yep just one thought then i'll go to the

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
abstract which is that kairos as opposed

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
to kronos like a chronometer with

251
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
decimal time kairos is like timeliness

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
and it brings action and sort of

253
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
a little bit of a moment that transcends

254
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
the tick tick tick tick tick so it's a

255
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,519
cool term

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,519
i'll read the first

257
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
third of the abstract

258
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
this article aims to show how the deep

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
history of early state societies entails

260
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,959
the development of a collective form of

261
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
cognitive agency

262
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
it relates classical works in the

263
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
anthropology of states

264
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
in particular scots seeing like a state

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
with the inactive account of biological

266
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
and cognitive organization thanks to the

267
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
unified ontology for self-organization

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
dynamics across scales offered by the

269
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
active inference framework

270
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
stephen do you want to take the next

271
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
piece of the abstract

272
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,040
yes

273
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
okay

274
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
so active inference conceives of

275
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
cognition

276
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
a synchronization across individuated

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
sensory motor states

278
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
it entails that biological or

279
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
sociocultural constraints display

280
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
minimal form of cognition by shaping the

281
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
behavior of faster dynamics in a certain

282
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
way

283
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
when such constraints collectively

284
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
define a basic life form

285
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
an integrated operationally closed

286
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
system

287
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
they can therefore be said to embody

288
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,440
adaptive knowledge properly speaking

289
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
and then i'll just take the last part it

290
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
says the inactive inference account i

291
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,920
articulate here strongly motivates and

292
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,200
methodologically grounds a hoist

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,079
a holist approach in the social sciences

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,920
indeed it grounds the study of human

295
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
societies in the role of structural

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
constraints whose meaning depends both

297
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
on the broader systems activity and in

298
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
the historical context of their

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
emergence

300
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
the present account of the dynamics of

301
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
early urbanization and state genesis

302
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
aims to illustrate this approach

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
and a quick just walk through the road

304
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
map of the paper we're gonna go through

305
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
the introduction section and then there

306
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
are three main sections of the article

307
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
the embodied intelligence in nested

308
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
minds is the first

309
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
the second is the deep history of cities

310
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
and states

311
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
the third from the urban metabolism to

312
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
the collective mind and then

313
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,719
we'll go through the conclusion

314
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,440
and first up in this

315
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
dot zero contextualization video we're

316
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
going to discuss the keywords which i

317
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
think there were no official keywords

318
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,240
but these are the words that i created

319
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
for the paper when discussing it

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
at the conference so we pulled out

321
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
intelligence

322
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
autonomy embody intelligence active

323
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
inference the free energy principle the

324
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
concept of thinking through other minds

325
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,839
and we've done that in a stream before

326
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,279
daniel is that true i think we have

327
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,240
right

328
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
um and then uh niche construction so i

329
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
don't know i don't have the facts on the

330
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,720
on the exact number of the thinking

331
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,360
through other minds um stream but we can

332
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,959
find that out somewhere during this

333
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
during this talk we'll look it up

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
um

335
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
so

336
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
evel do you want to maybe speak to we'll

337
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
give you the first stab at talking about

338
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
what you mean by intelligence and

339
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
autonomy we've pulled a couple quotes

340
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
out of the paper but maybe you'd like to

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
say a few words

342
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
so if i remember well intelligent

343
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
etymologically it's the capacity to make

344
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
links

345
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,639
to connect dots of data and to build

346
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
antiquity understanding of it

347
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
i don't want to commit to any specific

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
notion of intelligence because

349
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
i am not aware of any meaningful

350
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
first principle definition of it

351
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,720
there is a lot of work in measuring

352
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
intelligence like iq

353
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,680
which

354
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
maps to specific cognitive abilities and

355
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
has literally zero reason to generalize

356
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
to other life forms than humans

357
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
and we contribute to other life forms

358
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
than humans in occidental societies

359
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
the national autonomy is much more

360
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
specific it's important to uh

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
okay so etymological is one's ability to

362
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,839
build one's own rules so for example if

363
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,560
your city state has lows and

364
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,079
the organs that make the law are within

365
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,639
these states it is autonomous in a

366
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
strictest sense

367
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
it is also recruited in the study of

368
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
life and condition and the way cognition

369
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
is grounded in life

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,040
by inactivist scholars

371
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
where it is

372
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,440
related to a personal closure under

373
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
precarious consensus

374
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
so it is something that is

375
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,839
able to operate and able to recreate the

376
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
conditions in which in which it operates

377
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
while there is no uh exogenous force

378
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
that help himself do so

379
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,600
for example if you have a candle it

380
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
helps

381
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,399
there is a burning fire which uh

382
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,720
generates a flaw from season so as to

383
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
maintain itself but if someone does not

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
keep um

385
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
fuel going

386
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,079
this dies so this has no really way to

387
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,920
recreate the conditions at which it

388
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
operates this is in contrast to the

389
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,800
simplest bacteria there is which is able

390
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,480
to look for food basically

391
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
so the

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,120
active concept seeks to capture that

393
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
nice um daniel do you maybe want to read

394
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
the the quotes from the paper directly

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
referring to

396
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,079
um

397
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
intelligence and autonomy as described

398
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,839
er intelligence is the general ability

399
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
for a system to understand the world

400
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
either in a reflexive propositional way

401
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,560
or as enacted in their ecological

402
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,839
activity

403
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
and autonomy refers to the property of

404
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
operational closure under precarious

405
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
circumstance ie to the capability of

406
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
biological systems to continuously

407
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
maintain and recreate their own

408
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
structural identity as a result of the

409
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,920
collective activity of their

410
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,959
constitutive processes

411
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
right and these are processes that are

412
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
actively generating and sustaining

413
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,560
identity

414
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
and i think avell spoke really well to

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
operational closure um in the what you

416
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,720
just described but we just want to refer

417
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
anybody who's listening to

418
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,079
this paper by

419
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,040
monteville and massio in 2015 this

420
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,560
biological organization as a closure of

421
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,839
constraints as closure of constraints

422
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,399
so i want to emphasize

423
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
that there is i think it's pretty old

424
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,160
the percentage it has at least 10 years

425
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,880
and the monteville paper is an attempt

426
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,079
to formalize it in uh logics

427
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,000
so it is not necessarily the the

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,079
reference on this i don't remember what

429
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,579
is the reference paper on this

430
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,119
[Music]

431
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,559
awesome thank you

432
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,039
um maybe let's move on to embodied

433
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,439
intelligence and stephen if you uh this

434
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
is perfect for you if you want to read

435
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
the quote from the paper describing um

436
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
what embodied intelligence refers to

437
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
yes okay

438
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
embodied intelligence refers to the

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,840
ability for understanding

440
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,760
adaptation so sort of a mixture of both

441
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
that is imprinted in an agent's physical

442
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,520
structure rather than in some

443
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,280
general computational ability

444
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
yeah that's significant and then we have

445
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,360
the wood lice

446
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,720
alias yeah don't use the jitsi chat fyi

447
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
you can use key base if you want a back

448
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
channel

449
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
but that's the wood lice example that

450
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
carl firsten provided in the 2018

451
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,600
example that's a little shout out there

452
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
awesome

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
um

454
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,160
yeah so

455
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
the uh does anybody want to say a few

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
more words about embodied intelligence

457
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
maybe avel or steven or if there's

458
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,600
something that comes up for you guys

459
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,280
feel free to raise your hand

460
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
if there's something else you want to

461
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,160
discuss

462
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
and the slides are the slides that we

463
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,720
prepared avail for the

464
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
talk they're in the key based chat as

465
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
well

466
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,799
so i'll i'll mention just to say i mean

467
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,320
because we're kind of introducing at

468
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
this stage i won't start raising those

469
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,160
and loads of questions and

470
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
we'll save that for the the next one but

471
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,480
uh and i just note that um

472
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
that this is useful just to highlight

473
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
how this is being structured because

474
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
you've got this word intelligence

475
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
embodiment and

476
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
uh i know in the there's them talk about

477
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
the brain or the idea of the brain and

478
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
the idea of the mind

479
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
um so i think it's interesting here that

480
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,600
um

481
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
this this paper sort of bridges a bit

482
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
across

483
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
um the brain

484
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,039
intelligence mind culture kind of

485
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,640
uh area so when it's talking here it's

486
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
kind of seems quite an open description

487
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,760
um

488
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,400
and is um

489
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
really making sure it's clear to

490
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,840
speak to the difference to this general

491
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
computational ability

492
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
and that it's it's somehow a different

493
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
type of

494
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
uh knowing that's been done maybe with

495
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
the word you know morphological

496
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,080
computing sometimes is used in that in

497
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,559
that world

498
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
nice thank you

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
um maybe daniel do you want to

500
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
explain the free energy principle and

501
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
active inference

502
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,320
sure so

503
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
as on the slide here the free energy

504
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
principle states that dynamical systems

505
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,200
given sufficiently regular boundary

506
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
conditions which are required for their

507
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
continued existence

508
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
spontaneously self-organize so as to

509
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,320
minimize their expected variational free

510
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,919
energy through time

511
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
effectively maximizing evidence for the

512
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,080
world model they enact

513
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
so the expected variational free energy

514
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,880
which we talk about in more detail

515
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,679
elsewhere it's kind of like all aspects

516
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,400
of the system through time are what have

517
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
to

518
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,440
be handled in order for persistence

519
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,559
and

520
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
using some technical formalisms

521
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
that turns out to have

522
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
equivalence with evidence for a

523
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
generative model where one is persisting

524
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
active inference explicitly brings

525
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,440
action into that inference process and

526
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
it's the process by which dynamical

527
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
systems maximize their evidence for the

528
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
model of the world which they enact this

529
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
can occur by a system altering its

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
environment to fit expectations i.e

531
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
niche modification

532
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
so it's the difference between

533
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,960
the free energy principle merely saying

534
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
that persistent systems are going to be

535
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
isomorphic with those that have high

536
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,799
evidence for the world model which they

537
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,039
enact and then active inference as a

538
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
corollary process theory says

539
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
and the way that they're going to do

540
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
that is through

541
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,039
inference updating their internal model

542
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
or through action

543
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,000
which can be

544
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
just sort of like a flock of birds

545
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
action in the sky or it can be niche

546
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,760
modification like stigma g

547
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
nice thank you

548
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
um and then we can go on to thinking oh

549
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
stephen you have a comment to say

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
yeah just one piece here also sort of

551
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
flags up for me is the the use of the

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
word model because we talk about their

553
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,520
own model of the world and yet um

554
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
often we think of models as something

555
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
that we've created in the world you know

556
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
on a piece of paper and things like that

557
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
so again there's a sort of ontological

558
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,039
challenge in the sense that

559
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
it's it is kind of like a self model but

560
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,400
it's

561
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
it's it's a self model that's not a

562
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
representation

563
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,000
um so um but our language is kind of

564
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,919
couched in our history

565
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
um so anyway i think that might be

566
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
something that sort of resurfaces and

567
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,320
have to kind of

568
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,520
keep restating because people might have

569
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
this representational

570
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
kind of inbuilt

571
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,960
way of

572
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
you know those metaphors are quite

573
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
embedded so it's hard for people to

574
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
necessarily switch to what it means to

575
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,559
move away from representation

576
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,918
representational approaches

577
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,679
i have one question as well

578
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,520
the reason why we're talking about

579
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,280
active inference and free energy

580
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
principle in this paper so

581
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
avo

582
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
what

583
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
does

584
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,960
active do for this paper are there other

585
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,840
contender theories in the game how else

586
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
are people trying to take a unified

587
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
approach to studying

588
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,120
the specifics and the generalities of

589
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
states

590
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
so the um

591
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
the approach i have i define as an

592
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,240
active inference with the n

593
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,880
between parenthesis it's a synthesis

594
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
between what is said by an activist and

595
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,879
what is said back to influence theorists

596
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
the core framework is inactive i'm

597
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
interested in um

598
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
characterizing states uh

599
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
state societies

600
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
as a network of constraints so as uh

601
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
slow processes

602
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,559
that are

603
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,720
exist at the holy scale

604
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,679
uh not with the individual not between

605
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
individual but in some sense over

606
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,960
individual

607
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
and that

608
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,320
shapes the activity of individuals so as

609
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,720
to maintain itself that's the core

610
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,360
argument society is our organism but now

611
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
if i want to get there i need uh some

612
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
strong instincts

613
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,039
i if i need to get there in if i need to

614
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,440
formalize the role of states which are

615
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
at core information processing machines

616
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,880
in it i need to formalize in a struggle

617
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
in a stronger sense the relation between

618
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,679
um

619
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,360
public synchronization basic

620
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,159
authorization and epistemic states and

621
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,240
that is precisely what active influence

622
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,039
does

623
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,360
so i need uh the two

624
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,880
uh i need elective uh

625
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
formalism the native approach and i need

626
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
active influence formalism to

627
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,960
make the link between the

628
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
ecological activity of states

629
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
as an international process and the

630
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
body the

631
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,679
constraints that actually consists

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,680
that actually statistics consist in

633
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,360
[Music]

634
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,158
nice thank you

635
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
we can i guess move on to

636
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
uh thinking through other minds

637
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
um stephen did you have a comment just

638
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
one other comment as i was interested by

639
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
the um you know you're using the term

640
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
constraints

641
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
so

642
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
and in active inference is sometimes

643
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,520
thought of as the higher level processes

644
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
are in some ways constraining the

645
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
behavior of lower level processes rather

646
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
than necessarily dictating them so

647
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
they're you know it's look like i'm

648
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
doing the faster jig

649
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,360
and someone's just

650
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,760
slowing me down a little bit um

651
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
and so on so

652
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
yeah just curious that that word

653
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
constraints has brought in because often

654
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
people think of

655
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
you know intelligence is all about doing

656
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,480
things and

657
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,640
you know not constraining things so

658
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,919
anyway just curious about that

659
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,799
yep that's related to synergetics hawken

660
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,039
not bucky and about like a wave and a

661
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,039
ripple like the wave constrains where

662
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,799
the ripple can go the faster

663
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,200
fluctuations are constrained by the

664
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
slower ordering parameters

665
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
so here we have thinking through other

666
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,919
minds

667
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,120
and this

668
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
is another body of work which we won't

669
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
spend a ton of time on but

670
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,919
for

671
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
organisms that are making generative

672
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
models of their niche

673
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
sometimes that niche contains other

674
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,120
organisms such as their self

675
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
and it matters how those other organisms

676
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,640
also include generative models of

677
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,039
oneself so thinking through other minds

678
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,320
is describing how in a shared epistemic

679
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
niche shared informational niche with

680
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,520
shared salience cues for example

681
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,880
that two different agents are able to

682
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
coordinate

683
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,760
because they are thinking through each

684
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
other's minds like if i put up my hand

685
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
then blue will think that i want to

686
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,200
speak

687
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
so it's sort of like a little bit of a

688
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
theory of mind but with more of a act

689
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
imp flavor

690
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
so both like the idea of constraint and

691
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,919
this concept of thinking through other

692
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,960
minds bring me back to mike levin's

693
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
paper the computational boundary of the

694
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
self because of of the nested like

695
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
cognitive cones right and when he kind

696
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,279
of talked about it he talked about you

697
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,520
know the the higher order or like the

698
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,720
larger level the higher level organism

699
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
um or collective constrains the behavior

700
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
of like the the individual um like sub

701
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,080
level collectives um so that was kind of

702
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
this idea of constraint and and then

703
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,720
also um like thinking through other

704
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
minds like specifically we talked about

705
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,679
um

706
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,440
how

707
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
connections between

708
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
cells individuals but the connections

709
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
that that essentially breed

710
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
information sharing so so when you have

711
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,559
like a shared informational niche that

712
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,960
enables this this process kind of of

713
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
thinking through other minds where you

714
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
think more as a collective and so that

715
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
expands the cognitive boundary of the

716
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,159
self to then include other you know

717
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
individuals within that cognitive

718
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,639
boundary stephen

719
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
yeah and that ties into the work of andy

720
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
clark and uh the extended mind so

721
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,279
there's a

722
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
um so the way that that gets uh there's

723
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
there's a bit of um talk about how do

724
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
you think about that extension happening

725
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,200
and how much is it an extension of the

726
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
individual and how much i suppose is

727
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
what's being talked about here is how

728
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
much does

729
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
what has been extended start to become

730
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,799
its own

731
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,158
sort of cognitive agent

732
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,559
nice and maybe very appropriately avail

733
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,520
has returned and we are moving on to

734
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,559
talk about

735
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,200
niche construction and i think um avel

736
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,399
might have

737
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,960
a lot to say about the niche and its

738
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
role in

739
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,520
extending the cognitive boundary um so

740
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,360
maybe do you want to give us a few a few

741
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
insights into can we help us think

742
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,600
through your mind

743
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,760
modify the audio visual i'm not sure

744
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
what i could say about the niche

745
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,279
sorry modify the audio visual niche of

746
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,200
our joint

747
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,760
well that's attention

748
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
we modified the niche i will actually

749
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
actually within english i don't know

750
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
anyway um

751
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
i can't change your model of the niche

752
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,399
this is not what i'm going to do

753
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,840
i think

754
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
i'm not trying to do that activity at

755
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,200
least uh whatever um

756
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
so the there is body of work in

757
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
biology

758
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
uh evolutionary biology

759
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
which is centered on how organisms

760
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
modify

761
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
their direct environment

762
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,000
in a way that somehow fits their

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
their ecological needs

764
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,720
so a typical example is how beavers will

765
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,440
be

766
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
dumb source to get i i honestly don't

767
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,720
know what beavers get out of them but

768
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,960
they get something

769
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,640
and

770
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,320
the basic arguments uh in the um

771
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,240
thinking through of the minds uh

772
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,000
framework is that the way humanifier

773
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,520
niche has a cognitive value it's

774
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
externalized expectations

775
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
and

776
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,000
by analyzing expectations it allows

777
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,840
expectations to synchronize between

778
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,520
individuals

779
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,799
and

780
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,039
it's

781
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
there is a very clear

782
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,960
analogy or identity between

783
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
once you accept there is a cognitive

784
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,159
value in a niche construction as the

785
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,360
externalization of expectations

786
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,919
there is a very clear analogy and even

787
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,559
identity between uh niche construction

788
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,440
and excellent cognitions beaver are just

789
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,480
extending uh their cognition

790
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,799
their expectations the domain of the

791
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,159
world that

792
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,000
somehow participates

793
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,200
to the fact that they um

794
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
they live they keep on leaving and

795
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
understanding the world

796
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
so

797
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
there is a pretty basic way in which an

798
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,519
organism can expand

799
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,720
the

800
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
extent of the world the domain

801
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,159
which is operationally closed and which

802
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,480
participates actively in their

803
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,000
maintenance

804
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,840
and

805
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,200
this is basically

806
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,159
what's

807
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
there is to be found in this

808
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
construction by shaping their niche

809
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
organism shapes

810
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,080
their world they shape

811
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,399
their cognition they shape

812
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,039
their body

813
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,039
and

814
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,320
i'm not sure

815
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,399
i'm trying to give a general insight in

816
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,320
uh initial section and how it relates

817
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,679
but i'm not sure

818
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,720
how

819
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
relevant it is because i'm not sure what

820
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
is the point that is to be made

821
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
followingly

822
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,279
just that niche construction is an

823
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,600
important mechanism of

824
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
extended cognition like the recent

825
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,399
stigmargy models show that individuals

826
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,799
don't need to carry on board or

827
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
internally the entire cognitive

828
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,440
apparatus they only need to know how to

829
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,640
interact and potentially modify a niche

830
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
and then also i think this is important

831
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
when we're talking about

832
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,200
cities and so on and states because

833
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,600
our niche can as per thinking through

834
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,919
other minds include other

835
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,360
others like us

836
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,840
or distant from us but also it includes

837
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,120
the abiotic niche so climate change and

838
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
resource utilization those are niche

839
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,519
modifications there are some radioactive

840
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,480
mountains

841
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,039
that have been niche modified and so it

842
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,760
it provides a continuity

843
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
between

844
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,279
the kinds of ecological changes that

845
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,559
humans make

846
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
with the cognitive approach to

847
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,159
ecosystems and so that's why it's a very

848
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,440
rich framework to build off

849
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,600
so i just want to read this quote from

850
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,360
the paper really quick and then and then

851
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,600
stephen will come to your comment so it

852
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,320
says as stated previously the network of

853
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,159
constraints defining the structural

854
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,480
identity of basic life needs not be

855
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
printed in flesh it only needs to

856
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
influence faster processes so as to

857
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,519
continually recreate itself

858
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,080
and there the references for this are

859
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,320
there on the slides if you care to probe

860
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,960
further it says such constraints can be

861
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
embedded in the informationally rich

862
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
sociocultural niche which enable the

863
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,840
human ecology by affording adaptive

864
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,559
coordination and the development of

865
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,600
complex skills and i i think one of the

866
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,960
the main things that um this paper does

867
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,039
and uh feel free to correct me if i'm

868
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,799
wrong but it kind of takes the idea of

869
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,519
cumulative cultural evolution

870
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,880
and

871
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,520
brings the niche into this as a

872
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
cognitive extension

873
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,918
so i think that's one of the key moves

874
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,399
made here

875
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,359
basically i know a cultural revolution

876
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,239
uh i have known revolution for like five

877
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,480
years or so actually in france for one

878
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,879
year only so cultural relationships so i

879
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
see things and i'm currently writing a

880
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
paper on uh that could be integrated on

881
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
reductionism in cultural

882
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
and the fact is cumulative cultural

883
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,239
evolution in cultural revolution

884
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,399
is the replacement of low fitness

885
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,800
variants by high fitness variants

886
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,960
within a variant i mean of cultural

887
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
tokens that are implemented within minds

888
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
our behavior because there is not a

889
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,719
strong ontology on what the replicator

890
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,280
is in cultural evolution

891
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,879
and

892
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,200
a basic inside

893
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,640
world to convey is that

894
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,720
culture does not stop in the brain

895
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,359
culture does not certainly does not stop

896
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
in uh individuated cultural cocaines

897
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,079
and

898
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,760
one of the goal of the paper is to show

899
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
that social revolution it has analyst

900
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
extension uh our intention i don't know

901
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,839
uh

902
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,640
it does it exists uh not only within the

903
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
minds of individual and within uh the

904
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,280
verbal effects of cultural tokens it

905
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,780
exists

906
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,960
[Music]

907
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
instructors that are not apprehensible

908
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,680
uh by an individual

909
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,079
and that are not entailed by any

910
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,839
specific cultural token

911
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,640
hence the holism

912
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,760
thanks thank you stephen

913
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
[Music]

914
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
yeah also bringing that beaver example

915
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,680
is

916
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,760
to some extent the beaver constructs a

917
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,079
dam and to some extent maybe it grows a

918
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,200
dam

919
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
um maybe in the same you know so by

920
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,359
adding pieces it's it's growing

921
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
something a bit um and at what point

922
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
does it

923
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,359
sit stand back and say oh that

924
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,720
move that one a bit to the left move

925
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
that a little bit to the right and sort

926
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,040
of

927
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,440
improve the construction and how much is

928
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,680
it an evolving process

929
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
i suppose there's also the idea that

930
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,599
once something has grown

931
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,599
and it's changed the niche

932
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,599
um something else

933
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,599
you know just like the brain effectively

934
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,160
has to grow before it can do its

935
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,480
thinking um so maybe there's something

936
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
about

937
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,839
how these structures have grown

938
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,079
and been constructed so i don't know i

939
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,680
won't i'm just mentioning that

940
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,079
awesome thank you um i guess uh maybe we

941
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,320
kind of got ahead of our of ourselves uh

942
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,839
talking about niche modification and

943
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,920
cultural evolution um i love this

944
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,359
picture because it really uh shows like

945
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,520
kind of um how much we have offloaded

946
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,079
our our cognitive selves into the niche

947
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,640
environment like we don't need to know

948
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,240
how to use directions or what

949
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,160
restaurants are good or we don't need to

950
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,839
know actually any of that anymore

951
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,520
because it's all like riding around with

952
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,240
us in a smart phone in our pocket all

953
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,640
the time um so so we've just put put our

954
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
brain we've offloaded all of the

955
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
cognitive capacity of our of our brain

956
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,119
or at least a good portion of it so what

957
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,359
do we think about now what makes me

958
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,359
think about that always um it says in

959
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,560
the paper we claim that niche

960
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,480
modification is critical

961
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,640
for cumulative cultural evolution and

962
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,560
advancements such as writing allow

963
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
active inference to occur between agents

964
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,520
and stigmatic cues embedded in the niche

965
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,839
although

966
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,599
did i say what you did i write what you

967
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,000
just said

968
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,359
okay

969
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
what i want you to note is that what you

970
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
described the way we offload the

971
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
information on our social analytical and

972
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,160
technological

973
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
environments is the classical uh

974
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,920
collective brain picture which is

975
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,440
entailed by uh

976
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,839
mostly um void which has shown in

977
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,400
handwritten of cumulative cultural

978
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,599
evolution

979
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,000
uh what i want to show is that uh

980
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
together step beyond

981
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
we do not only have a self that is

982
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
augmented by

983
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
environmental cues there is a self

984
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
outside ourselves there is uh things

985
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,160
that shape social life and that are not

986
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,880
their agency that shape social life and

987
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,599
that is not human that is institutional

988
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,320
so that's the step beyond the collective

989
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
brain in the vanilla a collective brain

990
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
view which is maybe an anti-collective

991
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,320
brain there is

992
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,160
actually such a thing as a connective

993
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,000
brain starts an image and we can study

994
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
it

995
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
well we can study it now through

996
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,960
wikipedia and the internet like our

997
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
network of the collective brain steven

998
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,240
yeah it's interesting as well in terms

999
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,880
of

1000
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,599
we have all this extended information

1001
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,400
but

1002
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,599
there's this there's a very good book

1003
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,760
called the paradox of choice

1004
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,520
so the the thing is we have all this

1005
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,440
information but you still have to do an

1006
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
action policy

1007
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,000
on what to do

1008
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,359
and the challenge is you can have so

1009
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
many you know it's like going to the

1010
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,400
supermarket and you know you can buy

1011
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,200
50 different types of olive oil

1012
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
okay it's just olive oil at the end of

1013
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
the day but now you've got to choose

1014
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,480
between 50 and you've got you know so

1015
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
this there's a sense of abundance but

1016
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,320
there's also a need for an action policy

1017
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
which is of course what active influence

1018
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
talks about um that ultimately it's not

1019
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,240
the volume of information that's going

1020
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,040
to be

1021
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,160
the game it's the ability to

1022
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
act

1023
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,440
and uh inappropriate ways um and make

1024
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,320
sense of how to be in your niche so

1025
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,280
that's kind of interesting

1026
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,839
awesome thank you

1027
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,440
um so we are gonna move on um we're

1028
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
gonna go into the next section embodied

1029
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
intelligence in nested minds but but

1030
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,040
just to quickly

1031
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
summarize here like what was the main

1032
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,720
the brought up in the introduction so

1033
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,800
we've gone through the keywords but just

1034
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,359
to clearly just state it out autonomous

1035
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,200
systems are defined by a set of

1036
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
processes that create and sustain their

1037
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
identity they embody their understanding

1038
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
and adaptive abilities within their

1039
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,319
physical structure they enact a model of

1040
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,400
their world and seek to maximize

1041
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,640
evidence for this model through active

1042
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,680
inference

1043
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
and they can maximize model evidence

1044
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
through modification of their niche so

1045
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,240
just to kind of sum up what an

1046
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
autonomous system is and what where we

1047
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,520
are at this point and then we'll move on

1048
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
to um

1049
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,240
discussing embodied intelligence in

1050
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
nested minds

1051
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,040
so a quote from the paper it says uh

1052
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
here we argue that innovations are

1053
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,800
instead an emergent property of our

1054
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
species cultural learning abilities

1055
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,440
applied within our societies and social

1056
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
networks our societies and social

1057
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,079
networks act as collective brains we

1058
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,640
outline how many human brains how many

1059
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
human brains which evolved primarily for

1060
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,880
the acquisition of culture together

1061
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,119
beget a collective brain oh this isn't

1062
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
actually from from the thinking like a

1063
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,800
state paper this is from the innovation

1064
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
in the collective brain paper

1065
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,119
and this framework this collective brain

1066
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,400
framework grounds the study of

1067
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,560
intelligence in the way that an organism

1068
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
maintains structural autonomy and allows

1069
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,040
the formal assessment of the collective

1070
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
brain hypothesis so the collective brain

1071
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,119
hypothesis has been

1072
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,680
put forward but not formally assessed up

1073
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,200
until this point avail do you want to

1074
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
talk a little bit more about that

1075
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,440
because i probably just botched it

1076
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
about how the collective brain pathogens

1077
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,200
is not commonly assessed

1078
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,040
yeah

1079
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
so

1080
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,240
in cultural evolution you have

1081
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,880
what i'd say is the dominant theory is

1082
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
gen coevolution uh gene culture

1083
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,480
qualification theory

1084
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
which is basically centered on how um

1085
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,880
we have cultural variants that have an

1086
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
adaptive role and there are a set of

1087
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,560
cognitive bias

1088
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,319
or cognitive mechanism but actually

1089
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,240
cognitive bias uh bias actually actually

1090
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,960
that help us identify what are the most

1091
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
adaptive cultural variants and this uh

1092
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,040
has a feedback effect on gene selection

1093
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,560
which has an effect on cultural

1094
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,920
selection and

1095
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
basically all of your interpretation is

1096
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
until the process of

1097
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,640
a convolutional process between a

1098
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,839
genetic and cultural

1099
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,240
evolutionary information

1100
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
processes

1101
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,919
and

1102
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
the fact is

1103
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
there are claims there are numerous

1104
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
claims in the literature that

1105
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
there is some sort of collective

1106
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,760
computation that you entered our

1107
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,839
corrective cognition that is entailed by

1108
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,319
this so there is if i remember well uh

1109
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,680
henry and mata krishna who wrote the um

1110
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,760
innovation in the collective brain paper

1111
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,319
and there is i think boyd and um

1112
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,599
svaldino

1113
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,200
boyd which is

1114
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,280
basically one of the two founders of the

1115
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,040
initial formalism and smart dino which

1116
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,920
is

1117
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,839
one of the most competitively study a

1118
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,400
member of the current literature that

1119
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,800
wrote a paper on a collective cognition

1120
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,599
no

1121
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,280
collective comp distributed computation

1122
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,480
because revolution has discrete

1123
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,280
computation i don't know neglect data

1124
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
but it's

1125
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,720
uh i want to accentuate it a lot it's

1126
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,200
words like they have a model of

1127
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,720
individual bias

1128
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
in a selection

1129
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,720
and they have a narrative interpretation

1130
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,880
of this somehow in telling some kind of

1131
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
computation and there is

1132
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,079
nothing in between there is a few paper

1133
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,200
of

1134
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,599
less introductors that's kind of

1135
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,319
interested in the convolution of

1136
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,200
social networks and cultural variants

1137
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,760
access and smaller to name them

1138
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,119
there is

1139
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,960
literally not one paper that explains

1140
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,680
how is this supposed to be cognition

1141
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,400
what are the mechanisms what is the

1142
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,319
cognitive architecture there is nothing

1143
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,520
on it

1144
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
uh or it's marginal and i did not heard

1145
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,520
of it

1146
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,960
and

1147
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,119
the goal of the paper uh

1148
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,720
is to basically explain how we can grant

1149
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
a view of connective mechanisms that are

1150
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,119
entitled by the social cultural networks

1151
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,800
and structural constraints that are

1152
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,400
embedded within a society

1153
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,839
and that's it's not a model because

1154
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,920
uh to build a full causal model of any

1155
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,160
brain or organism is not

1156
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,839
tractable but it's to prove that it's uh

1157
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,960
meaningful

1158
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,319
it's a

1159
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,200
there is a positive way in which we can

1160
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
model societies as or at least process

1161
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,160
within societies as a collective form of

1162
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,359
cognition

1163
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,560
and a key example of this is the state

1164
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,319
because we have access to the mechanisms

1165
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
we have access to different papers with

1166
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
which they understand and predict and

1167
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,990
control reality

1168
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,359
[Music]

1169
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,040
awesome that's a perfect i think

1170
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,599
transition into the next slide

1171
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,200
do you want to read this first daniel

1172
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,319
this paper uses the framework described

1173
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,680
to illustrate that the co-evolution of

1174
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,920
top-down control and cultural niche

1175
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,079
construction enabled the inversions of

1176
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,079
the city-state complex and how these

1177
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,160
collective organizations maintain

1178
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,200
structural autonomy

1179
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,640
awesome thank you

1180
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,960
and so that's kind of the

1181
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,160
the summary i say of the of the section

1182
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,000
the embodied intelligence and nested

1183
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,920
minds uh section does anybody want to

1184
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
give a thought or we can go on to the

1185
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
next section

1186
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,920
just what you just said about how we

1187
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,720
know the mechanism level of the state

1188
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,920
um

1189
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,960
i'm thinking

1190
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,119
we see its neurotransmitters and its

1191
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,640
action selection

1192
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,319
policies

1193
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,880
so it's like

1194
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,560
every system has advantages and

1195
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
disadvantages for its study

1196
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,960
this is one where many of the key

1197
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,160
features

1198
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,560
are designed and so it's a lot more like

1199
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
investigating the connections of a

1200
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,400
program that was written

1201
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
rather than the potentially like map

1202
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,640
territory debates over like what is the

1203
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
bacteria really doing are we really

1204
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
measuring the bacteria but it's like we

1205
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,800
know how certain processes in the state

1206
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,839
happen

1207
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,599
but not all of them and citizens usually

1208
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,079
don't know

1209
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
steven

1210
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,200
yeah so following on to what daniel said

1211
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,839
a quick question in a way is

1212
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,800
how

1213
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,359
much you

1214
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,839
may be trying to have a sort of a

1215
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,319
realist approach on the idea of the

1216
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,920
brain or being a

1217
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
brain or how

1218
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,480
how much is it an instrumental tool or a

1219
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,119
metaphor so be curious as

1220
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,040
you know you take that correlation

1221
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
because you've got brain you've got mind

1222
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,119
you've got intelligence you've got

1223
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
extended cognition

1224
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,480
is it that you are really wanting to

1225
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,720
make it say that is like a brain that's

1226
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,079
kind of

1227
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:08,960
in

1228
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,359
enacting its own

1229
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,599
action policies or

1230
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,880
um so that would be that might be

1231
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,560
helpful

1232
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
so i think actually like maybe we should

1233
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,359
hold that to the end section from the

1234
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,800
from the because i think we're going to

1235
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
get more into how is a city like a brain

1236
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,240
um as we get closer to the end of this

1237
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,160
contextualization we'll save it for dot

1238
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,480
one and dot two because we'll cover just

1239
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
the background here but it's a very good

1240
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,599
question

1241
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,599
yeah very good um it's going to provoke

1242
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,880
a lot of discussion so that's why i'm

1243
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,160
like well maybe we should get through

1244
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,960
the rest of the rest of the

1245
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
talk going on first

1246
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
so um

1247
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,680
it is

1248
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,359
so we're moving on now to the deep

1249
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,960
history of cities and states

1250
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
uh here is another quote from the paper

1251
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,319
uh stephen do you want to read this for

1252
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,400
us

1253
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,599
yes okay

1254
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,800
cultural niche construction

1255
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,760
allowed humans to alter their social

1256
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,680
cognitive ecology

1257
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,920
in a way that allowed extensive

1258
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,839
functional specialization and the

1259
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,160
evolution of supra

1260
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,040
individual agency through mediating

1261
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,920
institutions

1262
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,760
that makes me think about the evolution

1263
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,240
of functional specialization in ant

1264
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,359
colonies

1265
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,559
and it's like

1266
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,839
you can't have the super specialized

1267
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,440
task you know you can't have somebody

1268
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,400
who specializes on just sourdough bread

1269
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,839
until there's somebody else who can help

1270
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,520
them with some other tasks

1271
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,559
and that's the economic inspiration for

1272
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,920
why they call that process in ant's

1273
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,839
division of labor

1274
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,520
downstream of adam smith 1776 the

1275
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,200
economic division of labor and the

1276
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,880
candidate maker and the shoemaker and

1277
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
all of that so once you have a lot of

1278
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,000
people living together they can

1279
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,839
specialize in a new way there are new

1280
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,640
institutions needy needed to mediate

1281
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,559
and that results in more being different

1282
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,800
i love how daniel like says ants and

1283
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,280
gets like giddy and excited

1284
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,680
a stephen

1285
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,920
yeah and i noticed this term super

1286
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,160
individual so there's kind of this

1287
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,599
um i suppose in the anchor you think of

1288
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,000
the queen but in in our world we we have

1289
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,119
these

1290
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,319
and actually i've been thinking about a

1291
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,880
lot of this myself in terms of how we

1292
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,839
relate to these bigger scales so this

1293
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,359
idea of a supra individual or

1294
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,200
supra

1295
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,839
collective

1296
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,040
ties into the idea of the state you know

1297
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,920
because

1298
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,160
you know we think of you know

1299
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,520
the word state is actually used

1300
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,319
literally in the united states to be

1301
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,720
you know a region but there is an idea

1302
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,319
that is trying to maintain something so

1303
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,839
um that term i think is a is a useful

1304
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,040
one to sort of put out and uh

1305
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,240
and that is super individual agency so

1306
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,400
that ties it into active inference in a

1307
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,040
in an interesting way um

1308
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,920
it would be interesting to know the term

1309
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,599
socio-cognitive ecology it's not one

1310
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,119
i've heard before

1311
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,559
in quite that way

1312
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,000
so i don't know

1313
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,240
that could be something just to just to

1314
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
maybe ground that term

1315
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,280
in this context

1316
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,599
well we can return to it and i added the

1317
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,680
book cover for leviathan

1318
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,919
with the person made up of other people

1319
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,559
awesome thank you

1320
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,000
uh

1321
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,040
so um

1322
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,440
in this section of the paper avelle

1323
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,000
explains how state niche

1324
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,640
niche construction depended on

1325
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,520
serial monoculture uh the technology of

1326
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,400
writing

1327
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,880
material infrastructure uh dense

1328
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,280
sentiment dense settlements

1329
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,079
and engineering societies from the top

1330
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,800
down as documented in seeing like a

1331
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,079
skate seeing like a state by scott

1332
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,400
um avail do you have a few maybe words

1333
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
to say about this i mean more than the

1334
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,079
brief kind of overview i just gave

1335
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
so i'm not sure identified a key uh

1336
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,319
subject like on the um

1337
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,280
importance on the uh morphogenesis of uh

1338
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
states from a social scientific

1339
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,440
perspective

1340
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,680
just we're just talking about state

1341
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,520
niche construction like what what did

1342
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,400
that depend on

1343
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,480
all of the things

1344
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,319
um

1345
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,280
but the career states is um

1346
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,880
i think we could have a lot of

1347
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,839
definitions uh their campaigns it i

1348
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,839
think it's okay it is said in certain

1349
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,000
tenses that it is uh

1350
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,319
essentially a monopoly of on legitimate

1351
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,359
violence

1352
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,520
so if there is a group of men

1353
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
that has weapons and that has the

1354
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,880
exclusive rights to use it and that this

1355
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,400
right is

1356
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,599
probably accepted it is a state

1357
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,200
uh i'm mostly interested in the mode of

1358
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
operation of a state so for me it's a

1359
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
chain of command basically it's an

1360
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,760
emissive systems that

1361
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,119
makes people do things

1362
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,760
so these those two definitions they

1363
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,920
entail

1364
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,319
the loss of human autonomy then tell

1365
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,640
that you have at least a subset of

1366
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,559
humans that

1367
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,599
are constrained to follow the laws laws

1368
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,119
that are uh extremely imposed

1369
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,559
so that's in clear deviation from what

1370
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,800
is done say in iroquois society where

1371
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,359
at least by the personal contact

1372
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,240
mostly no one has the power to coerce

1373
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,040
anyone else and any decision is grounded

1374
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
on rational debates

1375
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,119
so this is not what a state is like a

1376
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,200
state is when you are a guy with the

1377
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,720
biggest bird and you can say okay you go

1378
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,119
kill this person because i want to i

1379
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,000
want this weapon and

1380
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,240
um

1381
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,320
you have a

1382
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,000
[Music]

1383
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,760
definition of the states that's

1384
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,839
uh sorry

1385
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,000
your definition of the state there is

1386
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,559
that is uh grounded in the

1387
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,800
sub-brain i'm not sure when it initiates

1388
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,920
i think it's with leviton which i did

1389
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,720
not read but basically that the state is

1390
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,319
a central actor that has power um on

1391
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,520
anyone

1392
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,800
which is um sorry of

1393
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,000
chats

1394
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,880
things

1395
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,160
um

1396
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,559
so state is uh something that has power

1397
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,240
on anyone it's not tied to a specific

1398
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,799
individual

1399
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,079
so that entails the capability for a set

1400
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,680
of for institution or a set of

1401
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,119
individuals to

1402
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,880
basically coerce other people to do

1403
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,839
things

1404
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,280
and this entail

1405
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,760
for example enough at least a north

1406
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,599
centralization of resources for other

1407
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,119
people to not flee

1408
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,720
or enough imbalance in wealth for other

1409
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,359
people to get to you even though they

1410
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,200
know it will strip them of their

1411
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,520
autonomy so it's about the grounding on

1412
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,040
which the literature that project

1413
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,520
literature on um states and state

1414
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,280
emergence is written

1415
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,920
and this entails agriculture uh trade a

1416
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,480
lot of ways for basically wealth to be

1417
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,119
centralized and powerful people to be

1418
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,559
able to constrain everyone else

1419
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,599
awesome and that like speaks very well

1420
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,400
to um how

1421
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,839
states get a grip on their subjects and

1422
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,559
themselves um and what is the the common

1423
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,040
grounding maybe that um

1424
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,359
is used to get like to get a

1425
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,880
heterogeneous

1426
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,680
um

1427
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,599
understanding of states oh sorry

1428
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,480
emergency alert ah

1429
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,720
your attention please your attention

1430
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,400
please

1431
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,760
update in action policy requested from

1432
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,240
the state

1433
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,599
exactly exactly so so now states get a

1434
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,160
grip on us through like our our

1435
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,680
cognitive offloading into the knee

1436
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,520
strike

1437
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,079
um stephen did you want to say something

1438
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,680
yeah i mean this also speaks to that

1439
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,760
challenge of being able to get a grip on

1440
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,079
things which are beyond the adjacent

1441
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,400
scale like that you know they're trying

1442
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,559
to get you know they have to use they

1443
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,760
have these technologies they can reach

1444
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,200
out to everyone but at the same time

1445
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,480
it's kind of

1446
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,040
they can't easily get a grip

1447
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,960
so there's um there's some interesting

1448
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,119
points there around um

1449
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,559
you know because there's a few scales

1450
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,720
between us and the state right

1451
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,839
um

1452
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,920
and that's that's interesting

1453
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,400
and technological development

1454
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,359
like

1455
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,880
little tiny chips that track where you

1456
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,000
move

1457
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,680
that makes it a little easier to get a

1458
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,000
grip on where somebody is moving

1459
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,400
so it's a co-evolution with the states

1460
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,640
and technology going back to

1461
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,599
agriculture and writing and ledgers and

1462
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,400
now we're in a new phase of ledgers from

1463
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,520
zero one two three

1464
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,200
nice stephen

1465
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,520
yeah and of course the challenge is that

1466
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,280
they get a grip on what you're doing but

1467
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,440
they their influence is about why you're

1468
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,520
doing it

1469
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,640
decontextualized so

1470
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,799
they think someone's

1471
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,559
doing x

1472
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,799
or y and

1473
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,839
it may be wildly different

1474
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,680
you know they may be underestimating the

1475
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,040
risk or they may be radically

1476
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,480
overestimating the risk of behavior

1477
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,720
awesome so i'm going to just flip

1478
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,119
through these next few slides

1479
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,000
so

1480
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,720
uh dense settlements the what the

1481
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,559
function of the dense settlement did was

1482
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,520
allowed for economic codependency and we

1483
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,680
talked earlier about the functional

1484
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,079
specialization that was like you know

1485
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,920
necessary for this economic

1486
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,760
co-dependency and it also facilitated um

1487
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,520
the development of

1488
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,040
nested social communities uh um and

1489
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,319
daniel wrote is their scaling

1490
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,079
relationship here and i think we have to

1491
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,839
wait and address that maybe in the in

1492
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,359
the dot one

1493
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,640
um

1494
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,240
and uh moving on it says enforcing state

1495
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,400
control over urban systems

1496
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
mandates building acceptance into the

1497
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,720
population and this is like how do you

1498
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,640
let the state be in charge of you how do

1499
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,839
you grant grip to the state

1500
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,960
and this is

1501
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,680
the people must perceive competency in

1502
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,359
the authoritarian

1503
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,839
regime and there's a redistribution of

1504
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,720
wealth like for example paying taxes

1505
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,280
and also symbolic legitimacy which is

1506
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,599
achieved through the church

1507
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,760
um largely or maybe maybe there's other

1508
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,880
ways but but was in in the in the early

1509
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
development of cities and states largely

1510
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,680
um religious based

1511
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,599
so what um

1512
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,960
there's a lot of things that that we've

1513
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,000
talked about so that tie into

1514
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,640
formation of cities and states and it's

1515
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,040
large-scale coordination collective

1516
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,400
identity

1517
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,480
crop redistribution which i thought was

1518
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,240
interesting like some people grow it

1519
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,000
some people eat it some people take it

1520
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,839
some people sell it

1521
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,000
and then the functional specialization

1522
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,520
specialized rules

1523
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,400
and the control of the money and the

1524
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,640
flow of the money so all these things

1525
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,760
together

1526
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,280
unify to give a state grip and allow

1527
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,200
this kind of top-down control

1528
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,960
is is there any comments on that or if

1529
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,119
not we can move on to the next section

1530
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,040
just that if those are the necessary and

1531
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,960
sufficient features

1532
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,920
when there's a crisis of competency or

1533
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,839
distribution of wealth or symbolic

1534
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,000
legitimacy

1535
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,480
what is that forbode

1536
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,240
avail do you have a an answer i'm sure

1537
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,559
waiting and waiting in the wings

1538
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,440
yes uh the answer is basically uh a

1539
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,640
structural

1540
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,960
structural demographic theory which is

1541
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,000
central side results in clevelandics

1542
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,160
which basically

1543
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,000
states afford the possibility for the

1544
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,760
elites to ignore

1545
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,280
the social

1546
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,240
maintenance and just capture wealth

1547
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,359
and

1548
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,680
when they do too much it causes

1549
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,640
political instabilities so

1550
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,480
and this entails uh fluctuating um

1551
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,640
protecting cycles of integration and

1552
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,920
distribution

1553
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,960
in states developments and by the way

1554
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,400
we in the sense of france the us and

1555
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,359
likely

1556
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,160
global capitalism are in a phase of

1557
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,319
disintegration which

1558
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,079
uh needs

1559
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,160
which entails that we have uh you don't

1560
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,680
need to understand how to organize

1561
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,760
outside or

1562
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,000
in spite of

1563
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,359
administration and to understand where

1564
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,000
they come from

1565
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,200
cool

1566
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,119
so we're going to move into the last

1567
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,839
section of the paper which is from the

1568
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,160
urban metabolism to

1569
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,799
the collective mind

1570
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,400
and we're going to go back to the main

1571
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,359
question of the article which was what

1572
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,280
kind of intelligence is displayed by

1573
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,680
city-state systems and how is it

1574
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,480
embodied within their structure

1575
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,720
and uh maybe stephen do you want to read

1576
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,760
this quote from the paper

1577
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,599
yes

1578
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,160
okay so answering this question in terms

1579
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,280
of inactive inference entails revisiting

1580
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,359
our accounts of the urbanization

1581
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,319
dynamics as the results of city-state

1582
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,520
systems

1583
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,040
actively managing to get a grip on their

1584
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,720
world ie

1585
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,960
minimize their expected variational free

1586
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,359
energy

1587
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,240
cool and there are a couple more um

1588
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,640
quotes from this section uh that we can

1589
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,079
move on to

1590
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,599
daniel do you want to read this first

1591
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,520
one here

1592
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,920
basic autonomy is indeed formally

1593
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,880
defined as operational closure or more

1594
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,040
precisely the capability of a network of

1595
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,559
constraints to canalize faster processes

1596
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,359
like metabolic flows into maintaining

1597
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,000
and recreating itself

1598
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,680
i like that's kind of a twist on the

1599
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,079
kantian organism concept the

1600
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,400
teleological definition the organism is

1601
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,200
like the level it makes sense at

1602
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,760
and this takes a more operational and

1603
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,200
mechanistic approach towards closure of

1604
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,119
mechanism and

1605
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:45,920
uh

1606
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,079
constraints and autopoiesis rather than

1607
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,480
merely end directedness which doesn't

1608
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,559
immediately suggest a mechanism

1609
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,440
and then

1610
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,680
since the material and socio-cultural

1611
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,839
landscapes of urban systems canalize

1612
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,839
human activities so as to maintain

1613
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:00,799
itself

1614
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,039
the process of urbanization clearly

1615
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,440
intains the constitution of cities as

1616
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,200
basic life

1617
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,319
food comes in waste goes out

1618
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,000
city's alive

1619
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,680
awesome and i love this picture of like

1620
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,799
the elephant is the city um sir did you

1621
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,280
want to say

1622
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,079
i want you to something out that

1623
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,640
the first point you made is that um with

1624
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,720
the mountable and moisture definition or

1625
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,520
my

1626
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,039
account of them is a twist on the

1627
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,359
conscience idea that organism is the

1628
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,640
level

1629
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,640
at which it makes sense

1630
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,440
and it's basically the movement that

1631
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,000
monteville and monsieur and moreno make

1632
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,960
because

1633
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
uh in activism at first it's surrounded

1634
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,119
in concertal philosophy and feminine

1635
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,079
energy

1636
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:46,790
um

1637
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:47,920
[Music]

1638
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,559
this this is the grounding in which uh

1639
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,559
varela and maybe machrena i'm not sure

1640
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,960
articulated uh the view that cognition

1641
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,200
is in fact grounded in life

1642
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,280
and what uh

1643
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,839
mostly people and the basque center for

1644
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,559
life sciences i think it's called try to

1645
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,960
do is to mechanize it to personalize it

1646
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,079
to ground it into specific uh chemical

1647
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,680
biochemical processes so it's you

1648
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,119
precisely captured what this account is

1649
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,680
meant to do

1650
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,160
awesome

1651
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,200
and good good job inferring daniel

1652
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,960
based on based on the um you know

1653
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,559
stigmatic cues left in the niche uh and

1654
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,880
and we can move on to a couple more

1655
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,599
quotes from the paper um

1656
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,520
this is one that really resonated with

1657
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,160
me and it's paraphrasing jablonka and

1658
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,839
lam in 2006 this paper that's here the

1659
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,520
evolution of information in the major

1660
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,720
transitions

1661
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,480
says a full-fledged evolutionary

1662
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,079
transition typically entails the

1663
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,079
emergence of new forms of information

1664
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,720
systems mediating regulation at the

1665
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,200
collective level and or the heritability

1666
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,839
of collective traits

1667
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,920
and then another quote from the paper

1668
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,960
is also taken from this gaudian crawl

1669
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
paper in 2014

1670
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,720
it says the emergence of city-states

1671
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,319
with their professional classes and

1672
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,400
their mediating institutions

1673
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,720
based on writing technologies constitute

1674
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,039
a clear case of such a transition

1675
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,280
especially in the case of the late

1676
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,160
agricultural civilizations and i i

1677
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,559
totally get this and also it really

1678
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,760
speaks to how stigmatic cues left in the

1679
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,480
niche environment can can contribute to

1680
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,799
the formation of our collective brain i

1681
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,599
mean writing like we can leave stigmatic

1682
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,039
cues for generations yet to follow and

1683
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,280
some writing in stone right like so this

1684
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,760
is like still we can read it many many

1685
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,880
many many ages and generations later

1686
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,559
which i thought that was really uh

1687
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,599
poignant stephen

1688
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,440
yeah one thing i'd be interested in in

1689
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,960
terms of the state is um

1690
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,359
how much different

1691
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,559
areas of society or the state

1692
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,119
are trying to achieve similar types of

1693
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,400
outcome

1694
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,599
so when there's um and when there's i

1695
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,240
mean we've just had that case of um

1696
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,760
that video of

1697
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,559
a

1698
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,839
cortez being murdered and uh you know so

1699
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:18,960
like within

1700
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,839
the state you have

1701
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:24,160
internal conflicts you know within

1702
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,119
within the state itself um but also

1703
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,720
how much does the people at different

1704
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,039
scales have to be aligned or how much

1705
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,599
will the state itself kind of do what

1706
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,079
states do so to speak as its own mind

1707
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,960
awesome thanks daniel

1708
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,799
yeah i agree about

1709
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,960
not every single action in the state

1710
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,720
necessarily being the same like if you

1711
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,480
looked at the body you said well no

1712
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,160
we're supposed to be making glucose why

1713
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,440
are there cells that are breaking it

1714
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,200
down or like

1715
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,400
there can be sections that are doing

1716
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,359
processes that seem directly opposite to

1717
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,400
each other

1718
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,160
but that can be part of a broader

1719
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,440
regulatory process so

1720
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,039
it

1721
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,400
brings into question you know what are

1722
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,000
the official

1723
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
processes versus the things that are in

1724
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the gray zone of the state

1725
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,559
and how do we go from this model into

1726
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,760
more useful forms

1727
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,799
nice thanks

1728
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,599
um and so we can move now to another

1729
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,520
quote from the paper that is from

1730
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,880
paraphrasing

1731
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,720
this paper that we actually just did in

1732
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,880
a recent live stream um how to count

1733
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,799
biological minds by

1734
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,240
matthew sims

1735
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,920
and in

1736
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,440
in the thinking like a state paper it

1737
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,599
says if the nested hierarchy of

1738
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,760
regulation systems enables adaptive

1739
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,000
behavior at the system scale it

1740
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,319
effectively enacts a collective mind

1741
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,760
regardless of

1742
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,079
whether system components retain their

1743
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,400
cognitive ability

1744
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,839
and this speaks back to what we were

1745
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,000
saying earlier about the the top level

1746
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,720
kind of constraining the lower levels

1747
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,160
like maybe there's like a uh

1748
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,000
once you contribute to the collective

1749
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,960
then you know you've contributed to

1750
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,720
something greater than yourself and your

1751
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,400
your own cognitive ability perhaps

1752
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,520
doesn't matter so much

1753
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,079
any thoughts on that or we can move on

1754
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,599
to some more topics from the paper

1755
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,440
daniel do you want to read this

1756
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,520
quote

1757
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,079
the closest analog

1758
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,000
of our intuitive picture of a mind in

1759
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,319
urban systems is their most disembodied

1760
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,799
mechanism for adaptive regulation

1761
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,319
administration

1762
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,280
indeed just like neuronal cognition

1763
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,440
it entails the top-down regulation by a

1764
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,760
specialized population with the help of

1765
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,280
a specific purpose information system

1766
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,880
it makes me think about those tubes that

1767
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,720
they used to put the physical

1768
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,880
packages in and send them and now

1769
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,039
they're special information channels but

1770
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,079
you better be listening when that

1771
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,720
channel calls

1772
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,960
so that's like futurama like they have

1773
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
like i mean the bureaucracy like the

1774
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,640
administration and i mean administration

1775
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,160
i love this quote from the paper i do

1776
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,160
think like administration is totally

1777
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,760
like disembodied from like reality and

1778
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,960
bureaucracy is like so imposing but like

1779
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,560
in the futurama they all have like you

1780
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,560
know it's like space age modern

1781
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,399
transmission like you could just click

1782
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,479
docusign on the internet and like yet

1783
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,399
they're using like tubes literally like

1784
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,799
to send the things off um and it takes

1785
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,040
seven years to get approval or something

1786
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,439
ridiculous like that but it like it does

1787
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,198
work like that right bureaucracy is is

1788
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,439
kind of crazy

1789
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,080
this next quote says the institution of

1790
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,319
state-sponsored legal codes affords a

1791
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,158
way to directly transcribe

1792
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,560
administrative expectations into

1793
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,279
individual minds rule of law is

1794
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,279
therefore a core tool by which states

1795
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,040
create their world through building the

1796
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,520
basis of their own intelligent behavior

1797
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,839
into their socio-cultural niche and this

1798
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,759
is brilliant right like just yesterday

1799
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,040
my landlord called the codes officer um

1800
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,960
because my neighbors have weeds right

1801
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,399
like i know they're not allowed to have

1802
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,198
weeds it's beyond the expectation of of

1803
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,960
like you know our neighborhood that

1804
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,040
nobody has weeds and everyone knows that

1805
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,640
this is the expectation some people

1806
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,640
don't maintain their weeds and we all

1807
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,198
have the right and duty and obligation

1808
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,158
to you know impose that on our niche

1809
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,920
environment daniel

1810
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,238
um so the uh

1811
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,520
expectations the normative expectations

1812
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,640
a lot of laws are like you know it shall

1813
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,960
be within two weeks after this giving

1814
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,560
notice that this happens so their

1815
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,040
expectations and then they're called

1816
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,560
codes and so maybe think about

1817
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,000
predictive coding

1818
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,560
and it's like we can predict that this

1819
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,000
technology is going to be used this way

1820
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,799
so i know it's not exactly what people

1821
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,960
mean with the neural rate codes etc with

1822
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,040
predictive processing predictive coding

1823
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,159
but

1824
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,760
laws are

1825
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,199
normative they're saying what should

1826
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,679
happen and that helps

1827
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,719
behave as expected you want to be on the

1828
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,120
right side of the road driving in the

1829
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,239
u.s so that's like an expectation and

1830
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,920
then it becomes an intersubjective

1831
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,840
preference that is sponsored by the

1832
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,880
state so it's just kind of cool again

1833
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,719
showing points of contact between

1834
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,040
people's day-to-day life

1835
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,159
and their intuitive explanations for how

1836
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,719
these systems work and then it's like

1837
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,280
yes we have an ontology that picks up

1838
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,480
right with you

1839
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,840
and then

1840
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,040
goes a little further than you might

1841
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,600
have expected to

1842
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,159
awesome serval

1843
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,719
yes that's exactly

1844
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:41,920
the idea

1845
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,320
knows until the externalization of

1846
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
expectations the fact that they are

1847
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,640
normative is i think

1848
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,199
incidental accidental it's a phenomenon

1849
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,880
to their core role which is to shape

1850
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,080
behavior

1851
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,640
you have a project in

1852
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,239
legal studies i don't know how you call

1853
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:58,960
that

1854
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,600
which is called i think homogeneous

1855
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,480
ridiculous or homogeneous or some

1856
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,520
closely associated formulation which has

1857
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,239
a behavioral approach to bone

1858
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,360
and

1859
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,559
we need to do that more

1860
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,159
yeah sounds good

1861
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,679
um so we just have some summary um

1862
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,239
quotes maybe from the paper and to kind

1863
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,480
of summarize the ideas that were

1864
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,960
presented here daniel do you want to

1865
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,560
read one or some of these

1866
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,080
okay i'm just picking which one i would

1867
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,880
want to read i think the second one is a

1868
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,640
lot like what we were just talking about

1869
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,360
with

1870
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,400
the state defining expectations and then

1871
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,600
modifying its own niche that operational

1872
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,199
closure to

1873
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,199
implement those expectations lest it

1874
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,960
dissolve

1875
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,120
then i i like this top quote our notion

1876
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,719
of intelligence is based upon active

1877
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,040
inference a scale-free framework

1878
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,120
applying to any system with individuated

1879
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
boundary states

1880
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,560
and then it's like

1881
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,719
even the word state is upon as avail

1882
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,960
pointed out before it's at being state

1883
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,600
and french and we talk about internal

1884
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,880
external blanket states boundary states

1885
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,239
that sounds like it's going to be at the

1886
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,239
boundary of the empire

1887
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,320
and then this is what it looks like to

1888
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,199
apply active inference to a real system

1889
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,840
to go from a sort of bayesian graph

1890
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,400
boundary notion to being like well what

1891
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,440
if that boundary state

1892
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,480
country

1893
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,280
was

1894
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,520
intermediating and insulating between

1895
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,800
these other two so i like how even the

1896
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,600
word state

1897
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
comes into play i like that i i really

1898
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,040
like that too and i like that like that

1899
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,520
that's kind of a play on um like the

1900
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,520
first in particular physics like

1901
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,320
specific particular physics but also

1902
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,199
like physics as related to a particle um

1903
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,960
and and the idea of a state actually

1904
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,320
something when i was proofreading this

1905
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,159
paper was like you know i know that

1906
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,840
you're talking about like city states

1907
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,040
but it's not

1908
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,440
immediately obvious to the reader that

1909
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,960
like you might want to say like city

1910
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,120
states to kind of flesh that out like

1911
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,120
from the get-go because it is it can be

1912
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,880
such a play on word right it's a

1913
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,719
boundary state it's a blanket state it's

1914
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,960
an active state it's a you know city

1915
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,360
state daniel maybe one other thing we

1916
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,480
can talk about in the dot one and two is

1917
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
states as we know them

1918
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,280
are

1919
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,560
new

1920
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,040
and so it's only been a few generations

1921
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,960
like your great great great grandparents

1922
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,719
that's a long time ago it's a lot of

1923
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,640
tacos ago but

1924
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,320
it's a blink of the eye

1925
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,159
in terms of evolution

1926
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,880
and in terms of deep history

1927
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,880
and so even pre westphalia that was not

1928
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,239
so long ago

1929
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,679
and there's so many

1930
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,000
world traditions and so just

1931
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,640
realizing that we're in a very

1932
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,920
non-stationary moment

1933
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,760
with the development and the

1934
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,440
implementation of states

1935
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,960
it's really important because it can be

1936
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,199
easy to be like oh it's a grind all the

1937
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,360
states in the u.n and you know 50 states

1938
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,800
in the u.s it's like

1939
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,560
even 70 years ago there weren't that

1940
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,840
many states in the u.s and there was

1941
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,600
different countries in the world so

1942
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,560
things are changing it just sometimes

1943
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,000
it's at a different time scale which

1944
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,440
makes sense because they're bigger and

1945
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,360
slower entities than we are

1946
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,440
cheval

1947
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,400
i want to point out two things first the

1948
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,199
pawn is not intended but no i will claim

1949
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,320
it is and no one will check

1950
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,840
um the second is that

1951
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,000
the received you is that

1952
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,320
states emerge with agriculture it is

1953
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,520
what gordy and kroll said in the paper i

1954
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,640
cited

1955
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,040
um it is not accurate or we don't know

1956
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,880
whether it separates uh you have a

1957
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,239
pretty good single review of the

1958
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,159
literature of the

1959
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,640
state emergence and the fact is we do

1960
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,800
not know what human societies were like

1961
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,640
before written history we do not know

1962
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,400
so i

1963
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,000
and most importantly it's um

1964
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,640
something uh grabber and one grow to a

1965
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,400
leading anthropologist in historical

1966
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,440
apology like to uh rave about

1967
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,360
uh there are kinds of conversations that

1968
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,040
are authoritarian there are kinds of

1969
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,199
transactions that are not so even with

1970
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,400
if we are

1971
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,480
signs of i don't know great ritual

1972
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,360
states or anything we don't know whether

1973
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,120
those kind of organization

1974
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,080
were like what we know today because uh

1975
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,400
western national states are extreme in

1976
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,640
kind of extractive and corrective

1977
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,199
behavior but they are shaped by war

1978
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,239
within europe and between europe and um

1979
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,880
colonial colonialized uh countries

1980
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,400
uh so i prefer i much prefer to ground

1981
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,280
uh the history in which i talk uh in

1982
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,760
europe and history in a modern history

1983
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,199
after westfalia after the birth or

1984
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,199
in the roots of the birth of the

1985
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,600
national states because

1986
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,679
it's pretty hard

1987
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,760
to talk about the roots of sumerian

1988
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,239
states we need to do so because

1989
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:05,920
those are states we need to do so if we

1990
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,480
want to talk about what states are but

1991
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,400
if you want to talk about what our

1992
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,040
states are we need to go uh in west

1993
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,360
faria we didn't mean not to go in summer

1994
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,000
or egypt or whatever

1995
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,320
so just to kind of play off of that um

1996
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,080
extractive and corrosive behavior

1997
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,159
and that states are often born out of

1998
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,280
war um something that you mention in the

1999
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,920
paper but um i i don't think maybe gets

2000
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,520
enough um

2001
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,920
attention is the concept of shared

2002
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,880
identity because in this shared identity

2003
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,719
like that's what makes us faction off

2004
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,560
into our own state we're going to divide

2005
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,159
and become something new

2006
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,480
and daniel was saying how we have so

2007
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,400
many states now so many more states than

2008
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,480
we've ever had before and this like

2009
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,719
factionalism and we all have like this

2010
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,280
distinct identity is this going to breed

2011
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,520
more war or is every state going to

2012
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,080
become so small because they'll just

2013
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,760
faction and keep dividing i mean you can

2014
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,000
get something the most homogenous human

2015
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,320
culture you can imagine and they will

2016
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,800
find something to divide them so so is

2017
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,400
this good is it bad if it we keep

2018
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,920
dividing is it going to be like a

2019
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,640
homogeneous like bunch of sub-factions

2020
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,719
or is it just going to lead to like more

2021
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,480
division and more war

2022
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,520
um

2023
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,000
if i discuss that it will take a lot of

2024
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,520
time

2025
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,360
i understood this session was excellent

2026
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,080
we are much off track

2027
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,480
definitely

2028
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
we'll save it for the dot one

2029
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,560
um

2030
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,320
okay so moving on uh the collective mind

2031
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,760
does not directly emerge from

2032
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,080
inter-individual interactions but from

2033
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,320
slower evolving dynamical constraints

2034
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,280
which supervene on but do not reduce to

2035
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,360
human activity

2036
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,280
therefore the proper scale of analysis

2037
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,440
of collective cognition is an integrated

2038
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,000
activity of entire urban systems and

2039
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,920
should more specifically be grounded in

2040
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,600
the broader processes by which they

2041
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,520
maintain and reproduce their structural

2042
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,159
identity understood as an operationally

2043
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,239
closed set of constraints underlying

2044
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,679
their metabolic cognitive and ecological

2045
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,000
activity

2046
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,159
you know replace urban with

2047
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,679
brain body

2048
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,560
just you could say the same exact thing

2049
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,400
the brain the body have to be an

2050
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,360
integrated unit

2051
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,040
finally

2052
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,880
blue what does it mean to think like a

2053
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,080
state

2054
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,600
i'm going to put your overlay over the

2055
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,120
video so it'll look like you're a state

2056
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,480
go for it

2057
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,239
the cognitive activity of states is

2058
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,880
defined mechanically by the standardized

2059
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,719
administrative systems they use to

2060
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,040
understand and manipulate their world

2061
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,280
and functionally by their drive to build

2062
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,600
and enact grip over the material and

2063
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,560
sociocultural niche

2064
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,880
so there it is the question the answer

2065
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,040
we made it through from a to z and i

2066
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,000
like it's not what is it like to be

2067
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,520
a state it's not the nagel 54 what is it

2068
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,600
like to be a bat

2069
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,280
this is more of a cognitivist

2070
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,199
interpretation

2071
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,000
that

2072
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,159
helps us actually

2073
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,000
potentially find useful

2074
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,920
ways you know

2075
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,520
like

2076
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,440
i don't want to do a you know in in x

2077
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,640
country

2078
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,320
you grip the state

2079
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,760
people can kind of write their own jokes

2080
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,400
on that theme

2081
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,280
nice um and we can just think about what

2082
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,640
maybe these

2083
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,360
questions lead to maybe what a good

2084
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,760
understanding of this work might enable

2085
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,400
um avail mentioned earlier the

2086
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,600
necessity for this understanding because

2087
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,640
of the the kind of divide divided

2088
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,960
space that we're in right now

2089
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,880
what are the next steps for the fep and

2090
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,719
active inference

2091
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,640
what are the goals what are you still

2092
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,880
curious about if you want to participate

2093
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,040
in either of the discussion videos get

2094
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,280
in touch with us we would love to have

2095
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,840
you on to talk about these ideas in more

2096
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,080
detail do you guys have any closing

2097
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,400
thoughts

2098
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,920
yeah just in dot

2099
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,520
one let's

2100
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,159
dive in and open some threads take some

2101
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,120
notes

2102
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,920
in dot two let's see where we go maybe

2103
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,679
somebody would like to

2104
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,199
pick up on one of those threads or apply

2105
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,120
one of these ideas and say oh i was

2106
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,920
working on a history of my region and so

2107
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,800
i wanna

2108
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,480
see how i can apply that

2109
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,040
so we applied active inference to get

2110
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,679
thinking like a state and then how do we

2111
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:38,800
apply

2112
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,560
thinking like a state

2113
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,639
for

2114
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,480
something else whatever it is that

2115
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,440
somebody is interested in seeing

2116
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,440
avel thank you for coming and kind of

2117
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,840
guiding us through our contextualization

2118
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,239
video it's always a pleasure do you want

2119
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,759
to have the final word

2120
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,840
i don't know and it is anything smart to

2121
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,199
say so

2122
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,960
yes but

2123
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,679
these are the words

2124
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,679
the paper does speak for itself uh quite

2125
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,639
brilliantly i will say

2126
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,560
all right authors who come on dot zero

2127
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,159
are the best

2128
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,120
no it's all good thanks for joining blue

2129
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,960
and facilitating see you later survival

2130
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,719
and thanks also to stephen so hope to

2131
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,800
see you all in the dot one

2132
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,560
with the dot two or beyond so bye

2133
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,150
bye

2134
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:33,280
