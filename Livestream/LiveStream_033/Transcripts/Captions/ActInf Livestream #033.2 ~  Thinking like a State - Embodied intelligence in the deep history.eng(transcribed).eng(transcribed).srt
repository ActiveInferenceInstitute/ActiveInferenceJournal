00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,771
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,605
Thanks for joining.

3
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:46,279
It's November 30th 20, 21
and we're in ActInfLab LiveStream number 33.2

4
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:51,718
on "Thinking like a state:
embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds."

5
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,355
This is the second discussion we've had on this paper.

6
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:03,163
And if you're watching Long Live definitely ask us questions
because it'll help us have a fun feedback and discussion.

7
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,133
Welcome to Active Inference Lab.

8
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:13,405
We are a participatory online lab
that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.

9
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,309
You can find us at the links here on this slide.

10
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,616
This is a recorded and an archived live stream,
so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work.

11
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:30,190
All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome
and we'll be following good video etiquette for lectures

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,393
it's a new slide.

13
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,928
The short link is gone.

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:42,602
It's been deprecated thanks to the work of many awesome
active lab participants and especially Jessica B,

15
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:49,442
we have moved over our live stream past
an upcoming database to a coder site.

16
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:54,047
So you can go to this Coda site or maybe somebody can post a link.

17
00:01:54,347 --> 00:02:00,452
And this is an interactive way for you to look at the date video,
the title, the number,

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,289
the guests that were on the stream, the keywords, all the links.

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,362
This is linked up with our knowledge management as well as our people

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,966
management. CRM, as they call it.

21
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:20,607
So this is an awesome tool that we're using with Kota
and hopefully it improves the find ability and the index ability

22
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:25,612
so that if you're looking for some keyword,
you can find all the live streams where we discuss that keyword.

23
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:31,017
Or if you have somebody who you like to listen to,
then you can find them in the guests or in the participant section.

24
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:35,121
And you can hear what they had to say
about a certain topic at a certain time.

25
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,791
Today in

26
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:47,567
Active Stream 33.2, we're going to be having our dot to jump off
slash speculate onwards and upwards.

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:56,009
Discussion on the paper by Avel Guénin–Carlut, "Thinking like a state:
embodied intelligence in the deep history of our collective minds."

28
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,545
So we'll just have fun.

29
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:08,654
We have some topics from last time that we put on a slide for 33.2
that we can talk a little bit through as always, things come up

30
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:18,798
and it'd be great to have anyone's questions in the live chat, otherwise
we're just going to be chilling and talking about this cool paper.

31
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:23,335
So we will start with introductions and then just take it from there.

32
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,271
I'm Daniel.

33
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,373
I'm a researcher in California,

34
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:37,884
and I'll save my specific excitements or what I'd like to or remembered
about the paper for our kind of intro round and I'll pass to the.

35
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,354
I am Denham Calgary.

36
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:51,965
And I'm kind of interested, like said, in seeing
what happens when like our migration from Google to Coda

37
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:59,739
and we and we pick up and move off of some of these representations
or some of these ideas what that looks like.

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,075
And I'll pass it over to Steven.

39
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,911
Hello, I'm Steven.

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:13,353
I'm based in Toronto
and and yeah, I'm interested about the generative business.

41
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:20,293
I think this paper starts to create and I've had some good conversations
with Dean actually, and we've been chewing over

42
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:25,999
how much this maybe opens new doors
maybe is a step too far at this stage.

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,802
And the where other doors we might have that

44
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,438
we can step into.

45
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:39,344
So it's
I think it's an interesting set of mirrors and the alleyways to go into.

46
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,549
So I'm curious what those doors are.

47
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:49,989
Which ones have ramps, which ones are downhill
which ones are a spiral staircase?

48
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:54,460
Like what places would one go from this paper?

49
00:04:54,794 --> 00:05:00,599
And I'm sure we can start even writing on our 33.2 slide, like,
what are those doors?

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,101
Are they ajar?

51
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,870
Are they locked?

52
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,180
So, Daniel, one of the things in
I don't know if this is sense making or just messing with something,

53
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,754
but if a city was made up, oftentimes
like what we see in some of the empty ashes work

54
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:27,994
and then there were Markoff blankets all over the place,
what might that look like relative to sort of the

55
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,733
the city that I live in
or the city that you live in or the city that Steven lives in?

56
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,170
And are there ways that we can air the similarities?

57
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:43,509
And are there real differences between what
that sort of mixture world and mark of blankets

58
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,582
would represent as versus their actual representations of actual cities?

59
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,452
That's one of my questions.

60
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,756
So let me kind of unpack that.

61
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,157
You're talking about the M.C.

62
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:05,131
Ascher art with the stairs going in different apparent directions
and asking

63
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:10,068
whether those portals would reflect intelligently designed

64
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:16,376
transporters
or what does that physical or cyber physical city look like?

65
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,510
Yeah.

66
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:28,154
And many of these large rooms, you've had one image on the slide
that has the ants walking around the I forget what that symbol is.

67
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,156
Yeah. Mobius strip with an answer to.

68
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,057
The Mobius Strip.

69
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,927
So that would be an example of a real representation
that we could generate.

70
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,296
But is that a city? That's my question.

71
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,902
OK, Stephen, and welcome, Dave.

72
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,573
Yeah. Is that as it is?

73
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:55,614
I mean, it also takes me thinking about cyclotrons or just simple
transect walks, which is what you can do in a participatory

74
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,186
engagement with a town or something where literally you transact,

75
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:07,260
you walk through a cross section of a town
that you're not encountering it's the ways of structuring participation.

76
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,230
But it's it's an interesting question, right?

77
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:16,502
So basically start to move through
and we go through a path and start to see what's on that route.

78
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,471
And it's the same thing.

79
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,442
That's a question that goes back to you
as to why the doorways, it's like they're gone.

80
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:28,514
So to find my doorways and start squeezing through the doorway
or when do I need to again step back

81
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:34,053
and find the unifying principles
and where do I need to go back to accuracy and complexity?

82
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:40,860
And when do I go in to try and force through the doorway, you know, and

83
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,430
active influences allow me to

84
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:52,205
step back and hold more rather than try and not worried
about fitting through the doorway.

85
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,240
However,

86
00:07:54,474 --> 00:08:00,712
as we realize we're talking here, like at some point
you need to put stuff into the communications

87
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:09,121
encoder and Google Docs, you know, so in some ways
you're going to categorize for practice practical purposes, right?

88
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,692
But it's not the same as walking on the Mobius Strip.

89
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:20,032
So there's an interesting challenge as practitioners that we face Hmm.

90
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,404
OK. Welcome back, Dave. I hope it's working.

91
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,710
Just everyone remember to, you know, mute
if you're not talking and turn off all your messaging applications.

92
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:39,151
The idea of the transact, that reminds me a lot of ecology
where we know that there's spatial and temporal variation

93
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:50,096
but a common approach is to take a transect, like either going up
an elevation gradient or going within the same elevation gradient.

94
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:56,736
So those are kind of like the two directions that we always talk about
going on, the rotational component that climbs straight up the hill

95
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,974
to see how elevation changes biodiversity or to go at the same altitude

96
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:12,218
maybe on a north to south to ask how does latitude influence
biodiversity at a given elevation that's like that ISO contour.

97
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,689
So then the transect is a sampling approach

98
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:23,462
that in the context of a generative model gives us a picture of

99
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,232
the map

100
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,535
of the territory so yeah. Steven.

101
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,070
Yeah, that's good.

102
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:40,313
I think it's probably been ported over when whoever did
that is probably more used in participatory development and

103
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,183
community development than participatory theater.

104
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:51,924
And so it's like support development might touch on it,
but a lot of times space of work doesn't really let up.

105
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,595
When you go there. They just talk about scenes and situations.

106
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:05,204
But I I think the transit is a nice way to sort of walk through
and get a cross section in that kind of semi scientific way.

107
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:12,278
But I actually then was much more interested in going through social
topography, just allowing people to get the whole landscape out there,

108
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,545
which in some ways

109
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,114
once we get

110
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:21,420
into the kind of agent based work,
which I didn't know about that, but you know,

111
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:27,393
then the argument would be, well,
the transit is already adding all this complication.

112
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:34,400
You've got people who can take in a cross section of the town
as opposed to having something nice and clean, adding some why,

113
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,534
why go even further.

114
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:45,611
But in my experience as well, it's OK
if you regime if attention is being organized around a certain type of

115
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,681
objective inference, right.

116
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,051
So yeah, you don't be doing if you're deducting

117
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,822
because you just get completely swallowed, swallowed up by it
so that that could be interesting.

118
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,824
So cross over that.

119
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:06,365
Well, it's like one way to take the transect
and perhaps a null transect would be a quote straight line

120
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,334
that would just be unbiased or it's a simple choice.

121
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:15,975
And then in a city you might want to take that transect
or you might be on rails so you might be taking

122
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,477
the f muni in San Francisco.

123
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,114
And that's like giving you scenes of city life.

124
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,819
And that actually speaks to the difference between Kronos and Kairos.

125
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:34,627
Kronos is like that straight line that just doesn't care
whether you're putting the meter stick over the city or the mountain

126
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:43,202
and then Kairos is like that streetcar or the path
that's like you're walking along the path, but it might have curves,

127
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:48,641
but that's the path that you're on.
So then that's more like Kairos. Then

128
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,545
yeah. So I

129
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,016
don't know whether the author was intending this,
but one of the things that I took away from the paper that I thought was

130
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:07,960
really potentially an amazing insight from the paper was the fact that
if you go into a city, you can get a sense of a feeling of the city.

131
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,132
So there is a collective feeling
you can I'll take my own personal example.

132
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,805
You can go into the city of Barcelona
and it isn't just where it is situated on a coast

133
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,908
there is a fundamental feeling difference.

134
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:29,448
As somebody who is now within that geographic territory,
then the one that you

135
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,452
you sense when you're in Madrid or when you're in Lisbon,

136
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:41,761
they each each have a collective feel about them
and it isn't just that you want it to be different

137
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:48,000
because the architecture is different
or where it's where it's situated on a hill is different.

138
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:55,040
There's actual social aspects of that feeling
which make themselves present and which you attune to.

139
00:12:55,741 --> 00:13:02,014
So I don't I would never argue with the fact that as an example of

140
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,486
a collective act of inference that cities couldn't

141
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,689
exhibit those

142
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:19,397
those types of of not just behavior but sense of of who we are
and what we are, what we are.

143
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:25,337
But I'm not sure like, again, I'm
not sure if it the scale aspect of this

144
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:31,110
actually works because as I said in my mind,
I could do the mixture thing all the time.

145
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,550
I can twist things and invert things,
but it's hard to do that with dead things made of concrete.

146
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:45,257
Not I'm not saying it can't happen,
but I don't see examples of that out there when things scale up and out.

147
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,460
Thanks, Stephen.

148
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,030
Yeah.

149
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:58,237
And say as you walk in, if you say walking down
these routes in Barcelona, for instance, as you mentioned, that

150
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,173
you know, this the route that we pass along

151
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,977
and that's kind of what's available.

152
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,746
And there's a there's a scale that's friendly to being available.

153
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,617
There's a certain size building that certain
you know, at the end of the day, if you're walking in

154
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,621
or you're going through some ambulatory routes,

155
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:23,329
there's this things available to you there's this,
but there's also then what's adjacent to that and what's hidden

156
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,631
and what's hidden right next to you.

157
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,968
Maybe there's a homeless person on the site they on the same route.

158
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,204
Are they seeing the same things I'm seeing?

159
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,208
Are they seeing the same affordances? Are they seeing what's you know?

160
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,211
And often that route is where the vantage point is.

161
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,981
So where's where's what's behind that?

162
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,283
All on the right, what's hidden

163
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,723
from the time that we see these buildings.

164
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,959
And I think that that is

165
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:04,335
that's an interesting question of, you know, this the system
as seen from a perspective and then this what it's really like

166
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,973
in many different contexts.

167
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,477
Thanks Thanksgiving, Dean yeah.

168
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:20,151
Which which brings me to the rather familiar which to me
standing beside it sticks out at up and all over the place and has

169
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:32,097
allusions to termite mounds and, and, and, and like it's one of those
attempts, I think to actually mimic the things that we eat here.

170
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,867
And it certainly is building oil and ramping.

171
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:43,575
I mean, it's if you want an example of where architecture
is actually doing a symbolic

172
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,280
how do you do this?

173
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:55,187
Rather familiar would be a perfect example of that in terms of what
in terms of what about activity for some of the

174
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,557
some of the shapes we see

175
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:04,463
kicking out from some of the math
that's happening in the on the in the statistical mechanics.

176
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,099
So that's kind of fascinating to.

177
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:15,741
You know what you mentioned a few you know, little references
since we're in the fun data there we go viral.

178
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,410
So the Tower of Babel

179
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:25,651
weather or whatever
it was, it's often at least classically represented as a spiral ascent.

180
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,389
So that's very interesting. That that's it's not like the Tower of Pisa

181
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,792
with just rings.

182
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,362
That's like ISO contours that are separated from each other.

183
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:42,301
But there's something about the way that it's classically shown
that makes it look more like it's a spiral, which is,

184
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,504
as we've discussed from a technical perspective,

185
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:54,780
related to the decomposition of that spiral into an uphill irritation
or component and a purely rotational component.

186
00:16:55,414 --> 00:17:00,886
And then the other sort of reference was to William Blake's poem London,

187
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,956
where he says, I wandered through each charted street

188
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:11,330
near where the chartered Thames does flow and mark in every face
I meet marks of weakness, marks of woe.

189
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:17,469
So here there's so much about how the streets are chartered,
the flow of people

190
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:23,041
and the river is chartered,
because it's also part of the niche that's been engineered.

191
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,643
And there's also flow.

192
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:29,648
Which brings us back to number 32. That was our big lead in was flow.

193
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:39,925
What is flow and how can different systems have similar mappings
of heat flow, information flow bulk flow, particle flow, liquid flow.

194
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:47,066
So how does flow matter in a city,
the sewage going out and the resources coming in

195
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,171
and then also it's like even niche modification on our countenance.

196
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:58,444
It's marked on the faces that Blake is meeting.

197
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,314
Aspects of the city are kind of imprinted on them.

198
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:07,486
And then that speaks to what Dean was saying
about how there's like a collective feeling that's

199
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:13,759
partially architectural, but it's like a feedback
that's complex between the people and the time and the place.

200
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,627
So Dean then.

201
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah, and and it's, it's interesting too,
because the article that's part of this,

202
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:27,873
whether it's a cathedral or, or whatever the artifacts are
they get kicked out.

203
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,409
We can look at that from an ingredient standpoint.

204
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,679
Like we can look at beer as having

205
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:39,852
water and yeast and barley and, and whatever.

206
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,352
Right.

207
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:46,992
But but the fact is there's also time required and there's also energy
that has to be applied.

208
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:54,366
And I think that's the part
the time and the energy piece of city states that are

209
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,171
are the real key to whether or not we can see what

210
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:05,343
as individuals, we we perceive active inference

211
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:13,085
as affording versus what on the collective level,
we see act of inference as if I think where it

212
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,121
where it separates is on the specific set the ingredients.

213
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:21,660
But where the common is is in terms of the energy applied
and the time required.

214
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,899
Thanks, Stephen.

215
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,937
You know, with the idea of the time and energy

216
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,910
and we're to mass scale and stuff,
you know, when you're around the Thames,

217
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,713
when back in the day there was that big, there was a
there was a boat full of

218
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:48,787
important people and so royalty or the politicians or whatever,
but they were on the Thames and the boat sank

219
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:55,561
and the people in the water because the water was so putrid
and rank that a lot of them died basically.

220
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,697
And, and that instigated a lot of the cleanup.

221
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,601
So I suppose there's this question of like how close is close?

222
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,739
You know, like you get closer to water
and at some point you put your head in it.

223
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:13,879
You can't really make anything out of water,
you know, then you've got like certain vantage points which allow you

224
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:20,185
to understand that you're in a chartered Thames you get so close,
you could be in any body of water and then you move out further.

225
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,591
So there's a there's this there's a scale dependency in terms
of how you can structure.

226
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:31,463
You relate to the information and then just, you know,
whether you like it, there's a structurally dependent

227
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,498
nature of the scale of the Thames, right?

228
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,469
So I can't walk across the Thames
and it's too small compared to it's Wall Street.

229
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:44,509
So these are these are some of the questions in terms
of how the information's going to be processed

230
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:51,183
and how much of that information is adjacent to someone,
how much is if it's hidden, who's those people on that boat

231
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:56,888
they live next to a smelly tends for a long time, actually,
the people in the House of Commons, you have scented handkerchiefs.

232
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:03,428
They cut their nose
so that they could overcome the smell of the sewage in the Thames.

233
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:09,368
And so you know, at some point they got
they got up close and dirty to it and

234
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,472
probably change their perception of what was really going on.

235
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:17,776
Interesting.

236
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:24,850
So another thing I had written down
and kind of connecting us to some of the core terms in active affordance

237
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:32,591
which is the capacity for action,
and those are the opportunities for policy selection.

238
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:41,966
They're chosen among the different affordances
and in cities, it's very related to ability and access to people

239
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:48,840
who are walking down the street are able to enter different doors
and they're able to sit down in different places.

240
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,947
And so I think that's a very tangible and important example of embodied
extend it and cultured,

241
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:02,354
et cetera, cognition, all these and other letters,
because it's something that we all experience.

242
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,723
They're issues that people really care about and

243
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,026
putting them under a

244
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:13,332
descriptive, I hesitate to say neutral banner of affordances,

245
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:22,741
financial affordances or physical, or however it may be,
it helps us have a discussion about what the affordances should be.

246
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:27,112
Should you be able to get into the bus in the back of the bus,
there's trade offs for that.

247
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:32,150
You know, maybe it's harder to clock the fares,
but then it might be easier to access for some people.

248
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,554
But then now there's this ability for people to evade the fare.

249
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,358
But then how bad is that relative to the busses being late?

250
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,928
If everybody has to go in the front
like all of these kinds of trade offs

251
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:53,972
act of inference is giving a way to talk about the antic level,
the individual person on the streets of the city and their perception

252
00:22:53,972 --> 00:23:02,514
and cognition and action, which are selected from their affordances,
which are situational, not just like all people can go up a staircase

253
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:10,122
and then we have a individual level model
and can ask then, OK, collective model

254
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:22,734
feedback with a niche, and then where adults paper takes
it is like the city and the states as active inference agents

255
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:31,410
composed of subunit active inference agents, just like
we can have an acronym for model of a body as well as of the cells.

256
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,612
Stephen

257
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,547
Yeah.

258
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:42,487
I'd be curious what your thoughts are on this, Daniel, in terms of
when when we have the active inference models,

259
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,457
like you mentioned and often, you know, particular low dimensional

260
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:57,536
ways to get into sort of types of user attention, you know,
maybe it's the model or the nature of people, you know, looking at this

261
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:03,241
that they're their attentional states, X, Y and Z and the post,
the challenges,

262
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:10,881
once you go and you start walking through different doors
and you're in a town and you've got this question about what,

263
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:17,422
how do you model that when when the actual low dimensionality
becomes very hard to to work with

264
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:24,863
and I suppose that question then is at
what point do you look at what actual people are doing,

265
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,534
which hasn't happened as much in active inference,
and then try and go back

266
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:36,174
and try and understand, OK, what is what they've done
and how that's inscribed on the leash, reflective of the action

267
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:44,683
policies and versus how much is it about looking at the sensory room
that might explain the generative model

268
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:50,789
that we anticipate going on and emulate in that and say
that might relate to I suppose you might have that same question events.

269
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:57,128
You know, when you try and do an agent based model of a few agents
and as a conceptual

270
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,501
and when you try and understand what answer to in situ,

271
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,971
you know, because obviously that gets kind of complex, right?

272
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,440
Because they're all moving around.

273
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,644
So I don't know that has a correlation
to that question in that field as well.

274
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:19,284
But I think that relates here to this situated cityscape scale
because it's very granular once you get into that.

275
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,488
And in some ways it's nice to make it become like a mind.

276
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,859
It's nice to make all of that
because suddenly it kind of fits in with the model in

277
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,661
that we kind of use it.

278
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:36,234
And in some ways it might there may be some validity,
but it may be that the

279
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:41,373
we have to bring in that mind body environment, dynamic or mess

280
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,011
that opens in questions about what how do we go about that

281
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:48,947
good question.

282
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:54,718
So here on this slide, we have the dimensionality of active models.

283
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,423
So we can even just emphasize maps, not territories.

284
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:07,198
And then what
what does the next step in formalizing this model look like?

285
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:13,305
So let's think of a specific city situation
and then we can talk about like modeling

286
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:20,445
that city situation and what would the dimensionality of the Model B,
where does regime of attention come into play?

287
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,481
So what would be like a city situation

288
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,952
common situation, fringe situation,

289
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:36,061
important situation, like what's a case that we care about in a city,
maybe one that involves complex interactions between,

290
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:43,768
for example, bureaucracy, which was the main topic of the paper,
and legacy history and affordances of agents.

291
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:51,142
Think to get there
you'd have to have a lot more of the bottom up aspect of that

292
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:55,480
being honored as opposed to more of the top down control piece.

293
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,384
I don't know what the final product would look like
because it's act of inference.

294
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:05,255
I would be inferring and I would think that there would be
there would be

295
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,828
13 million architects and one citizen

296
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,002
which is not how cities are typically designed.

297
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,438
And that's one of the struggles that I have with this in terms of

298
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,011
drawing and drawing a parallel across scales

299
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,346
because there's only one to be.

300
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:33,318
But I've got however many neurons and I'm kind of dependent on those.

301
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:43,594
So OK, yes, I see where you're going
and I think we'll we're going to keep the bottom up and top down.

302
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:53,071
And I think this modeling approach, it's not the only one,
but starting with a scenario and kind of like Bruno, the tours

303
00:27:53,071 --> 00:28:03,481
actor network theory or agent appropriately we can start by identifying
traces and action trajectories in that scenario.

304
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:11,289
And let's see if in a bottom up way on our first pass,
we can get to like a skeletal active model.

305
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:16,528
And then the iteration is infinite slash perpetual.

306
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,597
So I don't think it's about just going for one,

307
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:28,372
getting bottom up input once and then laying the grid work down
and then crusties from there on.

308
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,511
It's an iterated process and this is how we start from the bottom.

309
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:40,185
We're going to kind of like start from the bottom up of a scenario
that's real, that describes subject verb object

310
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:47,958
that people will recognize person gets on bus
and then let's think about what active core terms we would want to

311
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,629
apply to different nodes,

312
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:57,435
recognizing that even the assignment of internal external blanket
states, it's conditional on our model.

313
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:02,474
It's not like the door is a blanket state outside of us
modeling it a certain way.

314
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,276
And certainly we know external and internal are that way as well.

315
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:10,548
Stephen And

316
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:17,322
then we have this, this question of model
and of course this is where the leash and how much the needs can come in

317
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:23,161
I think one of the things if we take in more modern societies,
I mean certainly more recently

318
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:31,402
is there's been an increasing role of this top down
or my call literally copy and paste.

319
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,103
I mean,

320
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,807
in Canada they've got something called Shopper's Drug Mart.

321
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:40,645
They've got these kind of stores now. And having worked in some

322
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,517
agencies, graphic agencies is I can just imagine

323
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:51,923
like there's like a design for a store, it gets tweaked and it literally
and this couldn't really happen in the past.

324
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,292
It literally gets copied and pasted

325
00:29:54,292 --> 00:30:01,533
and it looks like, you know, looks like, oh, here's another shop,
that's another drug store, but more like a chain, you know, franchise.

326
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:07,871
McDonald's is a classic case of suppose there's some adaptation,
but it's pretty much like Plunk, Plunk.

327
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:14,379
And in some ways that's that
that now there's an infant is kind of devoid from active inference.

328
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,447
And that may be part of the problem is the more that it's done that way

329
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:24,122
and the less that there's a kind of an even in the top down,
there's not really even an inference process going on there anymore.

330
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:30,461
It's like, what are we going to do I'm just going to copy
and paste using the machine, something that was done elsewhere.

331
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,097
It's not even contextualized from the top down anymore.

332
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:37,202
It's just we just completely bulldoze whatever we need to make it fit.

333
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,604
Agree that

334
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:49,981
that's the franchise model, which allows for rapid deployment,
for example, and then on the other side, from the user's perspective,

335
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:59,290
maybe walking into a franchise is comforting and there is a reduction
of uncertainty about aisle seven is where the cereals are.

336
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,760
Oh, well, I was right there actually.

337
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,834
They're even though I've never been in the city
and so that is definitely a evolutionarily novel context

338
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:17,275
to have that level of precision of like what you'll find somewhere
you've never been but it allows for an

339
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,648
increasingly globally accessible reduction of surprise.

340
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:28,253
And maybe we're seeing that the reduction of uncertainty of
what is there

341
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:33,725
and the quality and how many grams are going to be in that box
and the profit margins of everybody down the line

342
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:43,968
that system in many cases displaces the, you know, hand
shoveling of granola and every little co-op having its own granola blend

343
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:50,241
and these are definitely scenarios
that can be models of active inference.

344
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,578
Dave and then. Steve.

345
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:59,884
Yeah, the cut and paste mentality for corporate decision
making in particular is really destructive.

346
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:05,924
The single biggest determinant
for where you're going to locate a new business

347
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:12,196
if you're a corporation, either putting in your own outlets,
doing franchises, is there lots of competition?

348
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,466
There's lots of competition. That's the location I want.

349
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,938
So you've got all these outlets competing with each other.
When you go across town,

350
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,178
there's this whole underserved area where everybody would be happy,
including your employees and your stock owners.

351
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:34,953
I've seen this in when a Walmart came into my old town the one big draw

352
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:41,125
that would send people to
the Kmart is Kmart had not changed any of their layouts for decades.

353
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:47,432
So all the little old ladies who had trouble remembering
where they lived could still find the granola.

354
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,303
So what happens when one Wal-Mart opens up across the street?

355
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,441
Well, they went in, reorganized Kmart and all the little old lady

356
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:02,780
says, well, if there's no reason to go to Kmart any more,
I might as well save a few cents at Wal-Mart.

357
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:10,154
And and again, on the first pass,
it's like put it where there's less access to that thing.

358
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:16,761
But you go, Well, I already know people are shopping here,
and now I can draw people who are shopping and people who are new.

359
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,232
It makes makes dollars, doesn't make sense.

360
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,469
What do they say, Stephen?

361
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,639
Yeah, this this question about how to deal with a niche

362
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:34,846
is a massive, massive challenge, you know, because the

363
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:46,791
the bottom up ability to self-organize once that's lost,
if you do, you're now in a different regime.

364
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,695
You've lost something and it becomes

365
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:57,802
it becomes augmented by these other
because it's not even like we say that somewhat.

366
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,407
We look they don't necessarily look like if I was in a town,
I might look where people are shopping.

367
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:11,616
But actually what's happened is they're looking at the outputs
of some metrics which tells someone ahead of this

368
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,885
the the

369
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:19,891
key performance indicators
from which they can algorithmically make some decisions.

370
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,960
And it all starts to, you know, rolled out.

371
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,533
And one of the things that does mean in the initial stages

372
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,571
with, say, food, like one reason for say,
oh, why would I go to McDonald's?

373
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,109
Like, well, at least they think they wash, they don't know it.

374
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:45,016
But by washing everything in ammonia
or by basically buying things always not having a code I

375
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,485
which is not an incidental thing in some areas.

376
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:54,358
So you go there and it's like it becomes like this will never fall
below a certain standards.

377
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,194
That's what their main thing is.

378
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:03,034
We've got buckets and buckets of disinfectant around the back,
so you never have to worry about any of the equipment blah, blah, blah.

379
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,635
But of course, the downside of that is

380
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,004
that you

381
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:12,243
get into this vicious cycle of mechanization
which, you know, suits that kind of

382
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,378
producer.

383
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:23,387
That reminds me a lot of our discussions with Steven Fox,
I think in 27 about industrial engineering,

384
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:29,327
and before Dean could even reload, there was the craft dimension

385
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:37,668
and it was about the integration of craft and industry
and how just bringing up here's the tolerable limits like that.

386
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:43,307
Does it mean that you're going to take it
to some extreme over mechanic sized way?

387
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:49,881
But balancing those two,
I just want to return to a specific scenario, particular scenario

388
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:54,552
in a city that will help us extend and connect to the paper.

389
00:35:54,919 --> 00:36:00,391
And then we're going to go through some of the terms
and actually just stay with one model

390
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:05,963
and look at what does an active inference model of a city look like.

391
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:10,401
Some people may read Savile's paper and then think, OK, it was prose.

392
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,337
I didn't see a figure I didn't see an equation. I didn't see an example.

393
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:23,346
So what are we going to do to actually connect this to my local public
transit planner or this grant that we have in this area?

394
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:23,881
Steven.

395
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,552
We could use an example.

396
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,721
Helping to connect people connects across agent culture

397
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,159
and using public spaces and

398
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,595
Internet access.

399
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,432
So using actually the project, we're just looking at the moment

400
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,338
where we're putting in a Y find mesh in a community

401
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:53,711
as sort of a newcomer community, relatively low income.

402
00:36:53,711 --> 00:37:00,151
So this questions about, OK, do you do you bring in resources

403
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,488
so that people get

404
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,058
more stuff at home?

405
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,460
And then how much of that stuff at home

406
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:16,901
is enough to leverage something outside of just in in

407
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:25,743
how does that then leverage doing something with it
back in the community, making it something that extends the leash,

408
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:34,952
you know, and things like Meetup so I think that's a familiar platform
which has been quite useful for people to self-organize.

409
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,522
So we see this ability to do that through the Internet. But of course,

410
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,659
well, what's the ability to

411
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:49,900
do that in real life as well, like the coffee
shops, the cafes, you know, so you know, you know, anyways.

412
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:56,107
Yeah, let's pick a we can do like a meet up,
you know, planned or unplanned meet up at a certain spot.

413
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:04,615
But let's pick like a very specific scenario
where somebody can say, I haven't seen that be modeled this way.

414
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,952
There are new ways that we can now

415
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,487
talk about that scenario.

416
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:14,825
So many important areas connecting across ages and cultures, et cetera.

417
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:18,828
So let's think of some public space like we could do.

418
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:24,635
Say a cafe, a cafe adjacent to a park.

419
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,370
Let's say that.

420
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:32,609
And we know that that will might be related to other cafes,
which we say if there's this cafe next to a park.

421
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,979
And how does that relate to

422
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,582
you know, getting a coffee?

423
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:42,086
But obviously it's not just about getting the coffee, is it?

424
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,553
That is an interest in.

425
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,456
Yeah. What does that relate to the niche?

426
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,891
So we're going to talk about this

427
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:53,097
so how does that relate to the niche,
the ability to have action policies, the ability to serve service needs?

428
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,901
Yes. But also service wants and loves.

429
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,806
So actually in actually one thing
that you might find an interest in in in the

430
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,312
in the development world when they're trying to look at more complex
context is you got needs want and loves.

431
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,549
What would what needs to happen,
what would I want to happen, what would I love to happen?

432
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,552
And often what would love to happen is actually more generative.

433
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,457
We often everyone wants to talk about needs
or I need to get a cup of coffee.

434
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,359
OK, ego.

435
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,761
I need what she needs now.

436
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,631
I need a drink. OK, here you go. And it's kind of stuck, right? Well,
what do you want?

437
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,167
What would you love?

438
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,238
And that's kind of what humans have a role in.

439
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,607
You know, we're not a machine that needs filling in one humans.

440
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,145
So I wonder how you what your thoughts are in terms of how that

441
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,616
so a café should we think of because we're all going
to have a different cafe in our minds.

442
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,650
Here.

443
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,386
Let's yeah, I agree.

444
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,924
You know, it
shouldn't be like the cafe on in my little town on this corner.

445
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,661
So we're going to talk about a cafe adjacent to the park also.

446
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:02,066
Dave, thanks for the cool sumo references in the live chat.

447
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,838
I think that's an example of how you can scaffold and use ontology
as a thought pump

448
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,711
and explore formal dance towards the formal
and then back towards the qualitative.

449
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,714
So it's a cafe adjacent to a park.

450
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,353
We're not describing the territory that would be like a Boris

451
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:28,158
horror novella where we're trying to describe to the atomic level,

452
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,163
you know, the paint coding on the street light.

453
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:37,301
So dispense we're doing a human centric model.

454
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:46,710
Maybe there are assistant animals, but we're going to build up the model
and that's why we're discussing this on the slide with dimensionality.

455
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:52,283
So what's the dimensionality of a cafe next to a park?
I mean, the question barely makes sense.

456
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:59,522
You could have a parameter in your state space
for every molecule of air, but we're talking about a communicable,

457
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:08,332
simple model that might be on some sort of perretto optimal front, Bayes
optimal front of accuracy and complexity.

458
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:16,874
So it's like I can't explain this to the local politician
in a third of a seconds, but 3 minutes is probably too much.

459
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:28,085
So we're going to find some communicable level of detail and make a use
oriented act in skeleton and then see where that takes us in.

460
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,623
So this is a I'm asking this question because I don't really know

461
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:38,162
if we've got a cafe adjacent to a park, are we having some kind of a

462
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:45,602
are we assuming some kind of a compounded sense around
what is an attractor state here?

463
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:53,110
So it's a great question like dwell times,

464
00:41:53,677 --> 00:42:00,217
like maybe there's some transition frequency from the cafe,
you know, from non locations that we're not even discussing.

465
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,819
It's not the whole world.

466
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,287
This is our map.

467
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:11,662
It's just a little map into the cafe and then from the park to the cafe
and then there's like the ingress and egress of the park

468
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,230
and then it's relationships.

469
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,669
So we could even start to think about like nodes and edges
that are connecting the location of a person.

470
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,941
Stephen And then we'll start working through the list
or feel free to say in the Yeah.

471
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,811
Think that's the image
I was thinking about like the non equilibrium steady state is.

472
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:32,582
So maybe we need to think, OK, you've got cafe adjacent support.

473
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:39,522
OK, so like you say, you could be what's the non equilibrium
steady state of that grass if there's grass on the edge of the park.

474
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:44,161
Right, OK, what's the non equilibrium steady state for the

475
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,033
the behavior section.

476
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:57,741
And she has some really interesting work and that's how we have does
with behavior settings so maybe that could be another.

477
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,111
So and of course

478
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,414
we'd have to see what scale.

479
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,318
So again, what sort of scale is friendly to this kind of question.

480
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,653
If, if

481
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:17,428
the behavior setting was just kind of it's kind of an idea of the niche
almost as is capitulated by each person.

482
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,731
And of course this is where the challenge is in terms of

483
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:26,971
if I'm going to be taking the sensory state perspective,
I kind of have to take an agent.

484
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,076
Yes. There's no sense to outside of a specifically defined agent.

485
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,745
So which agent are we going to be looking at?

486
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,950
So we take the risk, join us, take the barista. That might be easier.

487
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:44,688
Look, let's just do human. OK? Human, OK,
so these are people who we're talking about.

488
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:49,593
There's other entities
there could be drones flying around for sure. There's ants.

489
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,697
There's all kinds of stuff happening in the territory, allegedly.

490
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,667
But we're going to be making a reduced dimensionality model,

491
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:05,075
maybe one that has low computational overhead or maybe one
that's easy to communicate or one that explains a lot of variance.

492
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,410
But not every single nook and cranny.

493
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:13,917
So we're going to be talking about humans in the cafe
adjacent to the park in a city Dean.

494
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:23,359
So if we're looking at this through the lens of active inference,
there's two things now that have been raised.

495
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,630
One is, do we have do we have an attractor state?

496
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:32,636
And meaning will people migrate, will they move, will they congregate,
will they gather?

497
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:40,044
And then Stephen brings up the idea of, OK,
so how do people remain in that non equilibrium steady state?

498
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:47,183
How does the expectation now
get realized once the migration has occurred?

499
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:54,024
This is what an action in active inference
working together allows where something gets kicked out at the end

500
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,060
right?

501
00:44:56,393 --> 00:45:01,965
Some some material thing with with ingredients
that we can now account for gets kicked out at the end.

502
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:07,471
But in the meantime,
what we have to do is we have to actually look will people gather?

503
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,976
Is this actually a place that people will now move towards?

504
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,978
And then because that's a city right?

505
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,080
They've all congregated.

506
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,285
And then we have to ask is will expectations meet intentions?

507
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:27,357
That's what active
that's what going through an active inference process actually affords.

508
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,961
It doesn't guarantee, as you said, Daniel doesn't guarantee this.

509
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:38,067
The specifics and the particulars
what it does, it holds up on a more abstracted level

510
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:44,041
for a longer period of time before energies actually applied,
before something actually materialized.

511
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:52,883
And I think that's what gets most people up
because there isn't a critical path ready to be fulfilled.

512
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,054
It's an act of inference process that has to have certain

513
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,890
anchors in the ground

514
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:06,029
before you can before an anchor is meaning abstract
that you have to have available

515
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:15,172
that act as affordances that eventually kick out the blueprint,
which eventually kicks out the dwelling the edifice.

516
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,209
Thanks, Stephen.

517
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,248
And so you've got this kind of broader dynamic.

518
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,817
So again, so resolving scales again.

519
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:35,492
So it comes in because it's like there's going to be the broad level
customers and someone serving in the cafe right

520
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,897
a Starbucks customer, a barista.

521
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,800
It's a tie in with that vibe.

522
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,737
You've got
they've got a different tell logical expectation even in the abstract.

523
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,705
We haven't even worked out who they are right now.

524
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,340
Of course, that's not quite so true.

525
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,709
If one of the customers is

526
00:46:54,011 --> 00:47:01,884
an adult with three year old child the three year old child's
expectations are slight different in terms of what it is to go in there.

527
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:11,461
So you've got this, but essentially speaking, there's
a regime of behavior that each of them are totally logically attuned

528
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,263
to to some extent.

529
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:18,000
Look, let's go through these terms in this order
and there's a specific reason why.

530
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,705
So affordances are capacities for action.

531
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:27,678
They're what actions are selected from? Yes,
they're ecological et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

532
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,548
Which affordances will we put in our model?

533
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:38,589
So taking out a phone of your pocket, it's an affordance
but is that the model that we're making?

534
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:49,867
So again, not the dimensionality of the territory, but what is our model
are we interested in treating the person like a blob?

535
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,402
And the affordance is literal.

536
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:59,042
Just go to the park or leave the scene
and so we can have a simple matrix.

537
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,778
Are you going to be in a three by three matrix?

538
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:10,621
Are you going to be in the cafe in the park or neither with a transition
on the off diagonal and the diagonal would be your dwell time.

539
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:16,226
So that is like the person is just like a point OK.

540
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,864
Also, affordances can be zoomed in and a lot more granular.

541
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:26,169
The affordances could be the angle of every joints in the person's body

542
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:32,576
and that might be relevant if the steps are going up to the cafe
and someone doesn't

543
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:39,783
have joint mobility to raise up their leg, a certain level,
then that is going to influence their transition movement matrix.

544
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:45,721
So when we course grain to just the blob
and that three by three transition matrix which is simple,

545
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,394
that may abstract above important layers.

546
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,930
So that's why iterated modeling is really important.

547
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:57,167
But iterating means we need to have something there to iterate on.

548
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:07,109
So for a first past, do we want to do a model of movements of the people
among the different spaces so that would be like one example.

549
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:12,015
Another example would be like, we're interested in drinking behavior.

550
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:18,654
So the affordance that we're going to
model is the choice of no drink, coffee, tea, smoothie.

551
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:29,966
So we're making a kind of behavioral economic model
and actually we're not as interested in the movement transitions.

552
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:36,773
We're interested in how the knish,
the temperature influences people's buying habits.

553
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,875
Or we could have both.

554
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:43,180
We could have where they are as a blob and what drink they buy.

555
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,585
Or we could have where they are and all their joints
and what drink they buy.

556
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,622
And then looking at the phone, that's the dimensionality of the model.

557
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,792
It's not the dimensionality of the territory
because we're still talking about the same place.

558
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:01,264
So what kind of affordances do we want to focus on?

559
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,102
Like we know that you could do anything
a person could do is going to be in Affordance,

560
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,972
but what affordances are we going to be talking about here?

561
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:15,879
I like the idea of working with the where, the awareness,

562
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:22,051
and I think there's a lot of tendency for what person orders,
what the thing is,

563
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:27,390
the sort of thing that you can in some ways potentially emulate in that

564
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:38,435
I don't think you can emulate the way in this in a lab like so
what sort of zones might they occupy like this, this around round

565
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,239
tables there's around the doorway.

566
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,741
So it could be, you know, you've got these.

567
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:49,946
Yeah, you've got the park. So even more broadly,
yeah, it might be a very broad level. There's the cafe there's the park.

568
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:57,254
And then that can, that can then break down by some zones
or maybe they've pulled out from the model

569
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,291
but so yeah.

570
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:10,667
So these, this is going to be fun because I'll just do like so
the diagonals of the Matrix this is like a movement matrix.

571
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:15,472
So the stay is the number could be like zero to one.

572
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:20,444
The probability in the next hour
or the next minute is not an absolute claim. It's time dependent.

573
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,948
And then you could imagine within staying at the cafe,

574
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:26,416
we could

575
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:32,022
make another little matrix
that had the table, the bathroom, the counter,

576
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:41,298
but it would be only and strictly within that top left cell,
that's the sub matrices that we were looking at in number 32.

577
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,403
So we're going to be in a state
and that's what course screening means somewhere.

578
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:53,810
Someone can't look at our matrix and say, How could you not have modeled
the counter in the bathroom when people have great,

579
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:59,883
we made a three by three matrix,
now let's make a sub matrix and let's make that fine grained or

580
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,185
and that sub matrix could be defined in terms of Chronos.

581
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:13,497
Like what is your coordinates in the cafe three comma, four or it could
be Kairos, they're at the counter or they're doing something spatially.

582
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,632
We're not putting a number on it.

583
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:21,071
So staying is the on diagonal
because we're making a course grained movement model.

584
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:25,942
We're not looking at their elbow angle,
we're not looking at where they are inside the park.

585
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,411
This is a first iteration an of a model.

586
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:34,116
And then if there was surprise coming from our model
discrepancies with the observations,

587
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:38,355
just like asked if we could update our model.

588
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:42,893
But again, iteration entails
we need a complete model before there's anything to discuss.

589
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:48,732
If people are just throwing out random core terms and terms
outside of the active ontology it's part of a discussion,

590
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,502
but we're not iterating on a model, so it's fine.

591
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,940
But that's not making an active inference model. Dean
and then will continue.

592
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,610
So I like this because materialization piece.

593
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,146
No, what gets kicked out is on a gradient descent.

594
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:10,654
But, but my question again then is so
when you're talking about affordance, are you including availability

595
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,623
as in what Steven was talking about?

596
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:23,933
Because of where I am now, things are at hand or proximal
or are you talking about threshold lowering, meaning ease

597
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:30,674
at which something can be attained is they're not
they're not the same thing.

598
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:35,445
And I want to know whether or not we're including both in terms of

599
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,349
crystallizing this materialization

600
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:42,686
Stephen.

601
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,855
And then we'll come to that.

602
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,925
And this is helpful. Like nothing is good.

603
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,894
This idea is truly down.

604
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,196
And I suppose this is this is this extra question.

605
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:59,803
Maybe it's at the side there, but is how much to

606
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:07,043
does the nature of things change by being in

607
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:14,783
the conversation or being how much by staying in one location

608
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,021
or moving between locations?

609
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,391
Is that question about this kind of
I suppose is it's kind of fluidity. Right.

610
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,628
And that's an interesting side question, which.

611
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,932
We can we can put it in our model.

612
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,134
We can we'll be able to actually iterate on that question.

613
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,971
And I'd argue this isn't drilling down. This is building up.

614
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,876
There's nothing to drill into until we have this fully described.

615
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:45,315
Otherwise, it's just like to people aren't
you can't drill into a linear model that hasn't been specified.

616
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:49,551
So there is no drilling down
until we're talking about something particular.

617
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:56,960
And then we could coarse grain
or we could fine grain, or we could iterate or elaborate or transpose,

618
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:02,065
but we're at the zero to one step in active modeling here. Dave.

619
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,934
Yeah, and

620
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:12,909
making those transactions actually change
as the inventory of potential affordances of other participants.

621
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:20,250
When you walk into a room, you give every person in that room
seconds to either greet you and establish

622
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:27,157
a potential relationship or to say, Oh,
this guy doesn't want to talk to me, or he would have nodded

623
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:33,430
or Goffman goes into painful detail on how that stuff works.

624
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:38,201
The and that one relationship can persist for years.

625
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:42,372
The guy you nod to and the guy you never to, you know it up or down.

626
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:52,282
And it's very personalized and cultural and that's definitely
like a level that we we haven't even gotten into the entire agent.

627
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,118
OK, but we can we'll we'll get there

628
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:02,192
and we can see is this part of our zero to one model
or is that going to be included in our one to two model

629
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,296
but repeatedly returning to not not you know,

630
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:12,669
it seems about thing but just repeatedly returning
to aspects of the territory before we have a model to iterate on.

631
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,171
The model is going to remain uncompleted

632
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:26,182
and you'll have done a partial inventory of a territory
in a totally ad hoc pseudo linear way when it could have been all there

633
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:34,691
and iterated using our ontology and framework,
which we're here to work on. Dean and then Stephen.

634
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:40,430
Is the sedan
and maybe you can help me because I say when I think about this,

635
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:47,270
the availability piece
because it's proximal doesn't mean that it's not on a on a high shelf,

636
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:49,973
meaning high threshold.

637
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:54,711
And I can't, I can't get the coffee bag down
that's full of the beans, right?

638
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,913
So again, I like what we're doing here,

639
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:03,787
but I still ask when we're talking about affordances, how are we

640
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:11,961
are we are we looking at two ways of describing that at a minimum,
because that's what I'm hoping we're doing.

641
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,997
But if we're not, what are we doing

642
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,270
Stephen, you are going to
you are going to give me some some thoughts around that.

643
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,540
Yeah. First, Stephen, with a recent.

644
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,110
Yeah, that got me thinking.

645
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,379
Allan's been

646
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:36,686
the question I suppose is as well as well as iterating on,

647
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:42,692
you know, we can run multiple examples of
so they might be one of these cases.

648
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:48,832
Like you say, many things can happen, but you could one
you know, you could have two or three types of models

649
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:55,205
kind of simple and you run them all many times and see OK
and maybe change some parameters to make something

650
00:57:55,205 --> 00:58:01,911
more likely that there's a long term relationship,
that there's a perception, binding energy that kind of is exhibited.

651
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:07,984
And then you can sort of look for clusters
of transitions, clusters of behavior or

652
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,320
patterns.

653
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,954
Right?

654
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:17,594
And so then we're sort of comparing patterns and to some level,
then it's in a way it becomes a sense making process for us

655
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:21,663
and the advantage we've got is
we can tap back into our embodiment because we're humans.

656
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:27,303
So you say, OK, I see in that,
what sense do I bring a higher dimension to all of that?

657
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:36,412
Yeah, you can have 500 groups of three separate
and make their own active model of a cafe adjacent to a park

658
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,782
but they all have to get that zero to one.

659
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,452
Otherwise, if they come together, what is there to discuss?

660
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:47,991
500 times 00. So I wasn't so much thinking of one as much
think about different people.

661
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:54,631
I'm thinking even though the person does the module,
you just literally run it lots of times, but slightly different tweaks.

662
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:59,502
And then so you get you can sort of get something from that.

663
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,872
I would say that's a different type of
maybe you start to see some of these patterns.

664
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:09,646
That's iterated modeling with getting the first version
and then changing parameters and iterating and then looking for patterns

665
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:20,456
across iterations that are achieved via a certain strategy
of changing parameters but incomplete model will never run. So

666
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,493
yes, there's

667
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:30,799
a total space to do stochastic simulation
and run one model 5000 times and 5000 different models one time.

668
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,972
And every other combination,
they all are predicated on iterating on something that already is there.

669
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,942
And so that's the zero to one phase. Steve.

670
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:50,053
I was puzzled how you translate the stories that you find in
so many academic papers or semi academic papers, sociologists.

671
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,990
Great. Is that something like this happens,
this happens is how do you turn that into simple?

672
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:00,062
Very simple exists, exists person, person enters room and I'm going

673
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,968
and you throw it in the model
and if it says contradiction, something's wrong.

674
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:13,142
If you're really confident that, hey, that's the way the real world
goes, you negate it, you throw a does not exist

675
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,379
and you got a universe and run it and it blows up.

676
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:22,285
So I guess not everybody does.
What I said is wrong. Let's find out what I did wrong.

677
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,420
Cool stuff.

678
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,255
You don't even need the exotic.

679
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,491
You don't even need to recreate

680
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,962
mathematically oriented modeling tool.

681
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,499
You can just do it in pure yes or no. True or false logic.

682
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:41,070
Just realize that this morning and level it up.

683
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:42,972
Nice.

684
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:43,806
Yeah.

685
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,141
Take people out their work.

686
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:50,713
Just used their word and they asserted that this.

687
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:57,553
And then I hope they used nouns and verbs
and if so, then you could be able to parse it.

688
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,026
So let's we're making a course grained movement model. So again,
it could be fine step.

689
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:08,531
You could have the affordance
be to take a step and the location to be something else. Fine, great.

690
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,333
But we're taking a course right now.

691
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,569
We're going to talk about the sense of the agents.

692
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:19,475
So their actions or their movements,
which is just a coarse green movement state.

693
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:23,212
That's the actions that they're doing. Inference on

694
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,550
what are their perceptions?

695
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,953
We know about the five 1155 senses.

696
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,824
It's not about the scent of coffee in this model.

697
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:42,064
Again, the future model with which thing they bought you could go to
what is their sense of smell.

698
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:46,903
But here we're just going to do a sense mapping matrix with light.

699
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:51,407
OK, so the cafe is going to have red light. I love red light.

700
01:01:51,908 --> 01:02:02,250
So the cafe is going to have basically an 80% chance of red light
if you're in the dark room, a point to chance of sunlight.

701
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:11,928
If you're at the window seat and it's never dark
if you're in the park, there's a 100% chance of it being sunlight.

702
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,763
There's no

703
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,734
there's no red light in the park.

704
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,538
And there's no darkness in the park. So it's like the daytime.

705
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,042
So again, that's iterating. So it's good to keep those things in mind.

706
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:32,949
You like have a coda or a space where you could have everyone's
perspective added, even when you're building a first iteration.

707
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:41,190
But some matrices do need to be specified to continue talking about it
as an active inference model.

708
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:46,195
And then neither will say neither. It's never read.

709
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:53,603
There's a rare red light that the cafe uses, and it's half the time
sunny and it's half the time dark

710
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:58,908
because that's who knows, we just have maximal uncertainty,
but we know that it's not red.

711
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:04,747
OK, so this is how the a matrix in active inference.

712
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,217
If you said you're in a dark room

713
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,787
where are you?

714
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:15,591
Well, here, given these simple numbers,
we know that we're in neither the cafe or the park.

715
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,763
If you said you're in a red light, where are you?

716
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,433
You must be in the cafe. The only place with a red light.

717
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,403
If you said you're in the sun,

718
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,872
what is the probability that you're in the park?

719
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:33,442
It's two thirds roughly. This is 1.7.

720
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:42,952
And so it's one divided by 1.7 is literally the probability
of being in the park conditioned on seeing sun.

721
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,955
So that is Bayesian statistics.

722
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:52,428
It's like we have a matrix of sensory mappings
and then it's like, here's a new observation, it's red.

723
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,333
You go, OK, it's 0.8 over point eight that I'm in the cafe.

724
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:01,103
OK, so that is the sense mapping matrix.

725
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:07,777
What is the inference on what is the s the hidden state where am I?

726
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,180
That's not directly observed.

727
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,317
You're observing only the photons in this model.

728
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,988
So the, the this is a mapping between

729
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,158
the oh, the observations

730
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,564
and then

731
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,972
the s the states that inference is being done on.

732
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,709
But aren't they thinking about their to do list? Yes.

733
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:44,080
In the territory keep it in mind. Add a note, add a comment.

734
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,715
We want to hear your perspective.

735
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,117
That's not the course Green Movement model.

736
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:51,654
So these are active teams for simplifying teams.

737
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:56,859
OK, we have the perception, which is the sense here.

738
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,163
Three states and we have the locations that inference is being done on.

739
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:07,470
Now we can talk about preferences, what our preferences for

740
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,641
this is like perceptual

741
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:16,112
control theory, perception preferences are over observations

742
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:22,718
so it's like the preference is to observe the body being in homeostasis.

743
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:33,361
That's part of the preference specification in active
so one could imagine that if somebody had no preference

744
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,165
for any of the I don't really care

745
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:45,141
then they would move proportionally
to the ratio of the transitions of the Affordance matrix.

746
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:53,582
So if all the transition frequencies were even and there was no
preference over sensory outcomes, you would be evenly distributed.

747
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:04,060
If there is a preference for darkness,
no matter how slight and there's any ability to move into the neither,

748
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:14,904
then that will be the attractor because individuals will dwell
in a more preferred state because they prefer the darkness

749
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:25,081
which is only accessed here if there's a preference strong,
then exaggerated, like a strong preference for sun,

750
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:34,023
we would see like everyone or almost everyone in the park,
a weak preference for sun would only slightly bias towards the park.

751
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,327
D Yeah, I think there

752
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:45,201
I'm asking should we assume that the preference
is to be vertically caffeinated or a caffeinated inverted

753
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:50,006
and not being a smart apple? I'm asking that.

754
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,243
Is that the assumption that we're building our model around?
Because you asked.

755
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,213
Here's here's the interesting thing about this model.

756
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:02,551
As we're building it in the first iteration, the sense is visual.

757
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,322
So there's no coffee in this model?

758
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:10,459
No, I know you do, but why isn't there? Right.

759
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,295
So if we could we could talk about

760
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,234
a different affordance matrix, a different sense mapping.

761
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:23,706
It could be Intrasection, it could be my

762
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,509
excited or not.

763
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,878
And then

764
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,714
do I prefer to be excited or relaxed?

765
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:36,118
So just two introspective states.

766
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:41,791
Then there's an affordance which is to drink coffee or not,

767
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:47,563
which is to have some probability
of moving you from one state to another.

768
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:55,303
OK, coffee is increasing your likelihood
of getting excited versus not doesn't.

769
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,040
That is not a spatial model

770
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:03,746
so now we could make that preference overcaffeinated states

771
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,651
and that's like a module that's going to compose very

772
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:15,591
interoperable with a spatial model
because the affordance vector, the sense vectors,

773
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:23,232
those can be heterogeneous that can be here's the three by three spatial
and the two by two caffeine.

774
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,634
And those are sub matrices.

775
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:32,608
And it does turn out that the cafes where that affordance is enabled
and there isn't the affordance for the coffee in your in the park.

776
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:37,513
But those are two types of

777
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:43,119
observations. There's the photon observation
which we're using as a proxy for location.

778
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,654
And then there would be the interception
which is related to the cafe nation state

779
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:52,460
and then those could be combined
and you could have a joint density, overcaffeinated and location.

780
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:57,933
And then policies like where to move could be selected based upon

781
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:05,007
the long term expected free energy
given the preferences and affordances of that agents.

782
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,710
So there are different modules

783
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:13,749
that can be composed in an integrative modeling
framework for perception, action and cognition hashtag active inference.

784
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:19,087
Dean And then Stephen. Yeah. Just real quickly,
I was going to say I was going to answer my own question.

785
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:29,798
I think then in terms of a preference confirmation, the iconography
on the side of the Cup would seem to fit with within the niche as well.

786
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:33,368
So maybe it's, maybe it's a large acacia tree in green.

787
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:41,744
So I wasn't seeing it in the sense that we were
I don't want to drag this off course when I actually reinforce

788
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:49,050
the idea of how preferences align as opposed to saying,
why aren't we including that?

789
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:54,990
I'm kind of reinforcing the sense mapping matrix. Thanks, Stephen.

790
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,531
Hello.

791
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,167
Yeah, I'm

792
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:12,575
yeah, I think this is I suppose one thing I'd like to check in
with though, as we just doing this, take a little bit of practice

793
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:21,750
you got, you kind of got with Deonte X, you kind of got exotic, huge,
kind of got the I can make a choice between the affordances for action.

794
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:31,493
So it's sort of coming slightly from a more deductive kind of scripts
triggering world, which is useful.

795
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,964
I'm also wondering there could be

796
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:41,637
say, for instance, that that sense mapping matrix
as well as it being something

797
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:47,442
that, you know, links
someone's preferences back to where they go more broadly.

798
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,913
So that's quite useful.

799
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,315
But I'm wondering also

800
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,218
if someone's navigating a space

801
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,956
and there's there's maybe within the camp,

802
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,561
there's some red, there's some some this is dark.

803
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,631
You know, I know you talked about embedding there's

804
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:14,003
there's there's a question about

805
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:19,141
but is there a tendency to to move towards the on tick type of

806
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,480
structuring because it kind of takes us there.

807
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:29,285
And if there was to be a kind of a more

808
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:34,123
gradient based

809
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:38,927
transition that's happening in relation to space,

810
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,331
it might be different.

811
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:47,036
You know, how much does this adapt to that
or does it need to be rethought in terms of the type of marketing?

812
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,373
OK, so this is, of course, green model.

813
01:11:51,707 --> 01:12:02,751
So to see that it's 80.8 read in the cafe and point two in Sun
in the cafe corresponds to 20% of the locations have sunlight on them.

814
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,723
So one could then make a sub model where at table one it's 100% sunny.

815
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,859
So you're still in a sub matrix

816
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:16,465
that core screens to 8020 but there's two tables that are in the sun
and then there's eight that are in the RET,

817
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:25,540
so then you would have affordance matrix
within the cafe sub matrix of moving over ten by ten tables.

818
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:32,880
But one can see that as you include more rows in the matrix
you get exponential explosion and that

819
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:38,554
proposes computational challenges
and just like parameter identification challenges

820
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:44,426
because maybe you never saw someone go from seven to two,
but it's not that it can't happen, it just there's only

821
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:49,231
80 people who went to the shop and there's 100 transitions,
so it just you're not going to see all them.

822
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:58,473
So then you get a very poor estimate of 100 parameters that's why
we're talking about modeling, not what is happening in the Territory.

823
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,143
This is going to give you some course grain results.

824
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,413
Then the sense mapping matrix is preference free.

825
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,282
It is not a preference matrix. The preference matrix C

826
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,922
is where the preferences are specified over sensory outcomes only.

827
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:19,928
So here's Dean who has like a nine to three of right over son.

828
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,998
Now Dave has one point, one to one.

829
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,135
So they both prefer red over son.

830
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:32,141
But we can see in the model stream
one, Ryan Smith and Christopher White, we talked about like what

831
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,942
these numbers mean, the ratio, their absolute amount, et cetera.

832
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,210
So we're not going to talk about it here.

833
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:42,951
But Dean has a stronger preference for red over son,
whereas Dave has a weak preference

834
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:49,291
for red over some OK, so we have the preferences over the observations.

835
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:56,698
OK, we have the affordances, coarse grained movement,
not the elbow motion, not which table coarse grain moving.

836
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:59,968
We know that we could make a sub matrix.

837
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:04,106
Then there's the action states, which is moving from one to another.

838
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,043
Then there's perceptions,

839
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:13,115
the observations, the sense states, those are photons, not location,

840
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,721
but there's a matrix now that could be a fixed matrix
or it could be learned, but we're just starting with a fixed matrix.

841
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,425
We have preferences over observations

842
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,295
those are only over colors of light.

843
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:33,535
And so for Dean, it's just a vector of three, but we're just contrasting
two different agents that are in this cafe area.

844
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,072
Then we have expectations.

845
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:42,377
So expectations are the generative model.

846
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:45,179
What would be expected

847
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,517
observations.

848
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:54,590
And so Dean says, I'm
the kind of person who expects and prefers read a lot

849
01:14:56,191 --> 01:15:00,996
that will shape which of these affordances are taken.

850
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:06,634
And so Dave and Dean can have the same sense mapping matrix.

851
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:12,608
They don't differ in how they infer where they are given the photons.

852
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:17,178
But the affordances can also be the same
and they'll have different behavior.

853
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:23,518
So that's how you get agent specific behavior from a model like this.

854
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:29,525
You can have agents with the same preference,
but they differ in affordances or some other combination

855
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,193
that's iterating and enriching a model.

856
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:37,533
And then just one thing here before we go to the question, Steven,
so what is the niche?

857
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:44,339
So yes, again, the territory with the everything is
just everything in the world, but the niche is the generative process.

858
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:50,712
So the agent is the generative model
and the niche is the generative process that's actually like handing

859
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:57,786
those observations to the agent in this case, it's
just the emission of photons.

860
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,389
It's literally just the light source is the niche

861
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:08,062
because we're making a super simple model where the only observation
that's getting handed from the niche is photon.

862
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:09,965
So the only

863
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:15,737
thing we need to say for the niche is it's the process
the hidden process that emits photons.

864
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:23,045
Maybe it's a red light bulb, maybe it's red
cellophane and it's white light, or that's the hidden generative process

865
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:28,917
the niche in this case is just the process
that emits observations to the agent

866
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,588
so that they can then integrate that into their generative model.

867
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,592
Stephen, did you want to. Yeah.

868
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:44,833
Yeah, I think, I mean, rather than necessarily emission of photons, you
could say it's like the perception of light is it could be perception.

869
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:50,973
The agent perceives the observation of light,
but the niche is the process that gives rise to agents observations.

870
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,545
Ryan OK, if you take it from the red, it red is not photons.

871
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:59,014
That's the perception of study.

872
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,649
Without getting into what is red.

873
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:07,556
Do we also see that we're talking about the mapping between
the perception of what is called in English red and the location state.

874
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:11,759
And the location state now? Exactly.
And so you then go, well, two questions.

875
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,332
One questions, you know, the next you've got 930 as opposed to doesn't.
So how do you scale that line?

876
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,533
Would you you don't do it.

877
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:23,472
So they always number one is the highest
and you've actually gone above one there.

878
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,342
So is that they use a different
how would you scale what the maximum is? Yeah.

879
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:31,480
So this is what we talked about in module stream
one with Brian Smith. But basically

880
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,818
these numbers do get normalized to

881
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:43,325
some to one to be a proper probability in a soft max function.

882
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:48,362
Oh, I think you just sums them all up
and then to by sums them all up and that's.

883
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,234
How you get the probability proper from this.

884
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:56,905
But then the ability to have it go beyond just one.

885
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:03,545
So that's the difference between like you know, five and one versus 50
and ten,

886
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,883
depending on the generative model,
those might behave very, very differently.

887
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,453
Going yeah.

888
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:17,793
Just first of all, this is fantastic to build it in real time,
but I want to just now ask a question.

889
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:23,432
So, so and then in real terms, you built this model
and it kind of makes us aware of things that we

890
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,769
maybe wouldn't be aware of
because we work in the active inference realm.

891
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,772
But now my question is, so so now

892
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:34,576
is this is this also projection

893
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:43,919
or what kind of inferences do we make of this in terms of agents
go, don't go, because that's weapon to me.

894
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,955
Then that's when the real value

895
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:51,559
is realized
because we can't predict with certainty who goes and who doesn't,

896
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:57,599
who ends up at the cafe with the coffee
and who stays at home and watches friends.

897
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:02,003
Right? So how so we've got this. This is fantastic.

898
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:10,112
But now we want to get to a place
where a person who normally would be somewhat risk averse

899
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:19,987
takes this and goes, Oh my goodness, this opened up something
that I would normally never have a goal, but now I'm prepared to go.

900
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:25,093
Does it help? Do you think this work helps that person

901
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,264
just off the top of your head?

902
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:34,536
Because I know it helps me, helps you,
but that person who is trying to do this on that

903
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:39,541
decision branch moment,
how does it make how does making them aware of this

904
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:42,611
alter their thinking.

905
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:51,987
I think it does a few things, some of which we've seen in the past
few minutes, others which probably remain to be explored

906
01:19:52,921 --> 01:20:02,264
it separates out observations from the state that's being inferred
because it'd be very easy just to simply say, well, I prefer the cafe

907
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:07,502
oh, I'm observing Red in the cafe and I prefer Red.

908
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:18,180
So by having the preferences over outcomes and then separating the
observed outcome from the inferred, hidden state, you know, if you like,

909
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,851
you like spicy food, that's why you say you like this kind of food.

910
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,221
So pull it back to these matrices.

911
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,392
Let's just say that they knew all the options.

912
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:35,764
Maybe people are not aware of all the affordances
that they can even take, or maybe they have something to add themselves.

913
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:39,668
So this is like saying this is like, these are all your chess moves.

914
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:41,702
We're not. We're playing chess.

915
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:45,974
So we're not even going to worry about,
you know, knocking the pieces off the table.

916
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,243
Like we're playing a well-mannered chess game.

917
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:52,447
But we can modify the rules.
But you know, we're playing with the affordances.

918
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:55,016
So somebody might have their

919
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,654
mind expanded
by just considering all the affordances that are available.

920
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:04,826
Like, well, I guess I could go to the art museum in the city,
but I'm not that kind of person.

921
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,962
It just hadn't even seemed to me.

922
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:13,201
So by bringing that regime of attention to affordances,
we're seeing the whole space, then

923
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:20,041
people can separate out the outcomes that they have preferences over for

924
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,410
the hidden states.

925
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:32,053
And then affordances are the actions that modify
the transition probability of the hidden states actions.

926
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:38,059
That's like where the pie plugs into the B,
which is intermediate between the extra time

927
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:43,198
the pie policy doesn't plug in to changing the state.

928
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:47,135
You don't have an affordance for red like

929
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:53,174
you have an affordance
to move to a location that you've inferred has higher red light.

930
01:21:54,009 --> 01:22:01,883
So there's probably many other approaches,
but this sort of like gets the whole map out there

931
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:07,923
in terms of the space of the possible,
which is again, we're saying that is the space of the possible.

932
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,991
It's not like there's some other secret affordance.

933
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:15,664
And then you can have a conversation

934
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:19,100
about how people map

935
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:26,508
their perceptions, which can include internal perceptions
like being bored or being sad or happy.

936
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:31,146
That's the whole mental action they can map their

937
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,283
preferences over observations

938
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,322
to inference on states and the affordances that get them there.

939
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:43,425
Well.

940
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,795
OK, I'm sorry you

941
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,497
you froze for a minute there partway through your explanation.

942
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:53,101
So if I'm saying something back that you already answered, I apologize.

943
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:57,272
But so this kind of to me now in

944
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:03,478
so now that we are talking about regime of attention,
because you are still I still heard

945
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:08,850
that part that kind of goes back to one of those last screens
before where we were I think I mentioned.

946
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,520
Is it about time on task?

947
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,356
Because we can now measure that because that's

948
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:20,527
now something that we've easy to measure
or is it still about what have we made available to ourselves?

949
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:31,406
And so what we get a sense of in terms of what we might be missing,
in terms of change blindness as one example, versus what we now

950
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,143
again, what are what

951
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:41,282
how we've expanded our awareness
as opposed to what we've given more attention over to.

952
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:47,455
Because again, my sense is it's it's easy to measure
what I'm paying attention to.

953
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:51,960
It's more difficult, but probably more valuable to know what

954
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:58,933
what the possibilities are in terms of that 80, 20
that I may not have been conscious of before.

955
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,870
Does that, does that make sense to you?

956
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,974
Because that's that's how I see this eventually.

957
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:09,310
Moving on to gradient descent.

958
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:12,080
Yes. So these are a single level agents right now.

959
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:15,650
Like they don't have metacognition,

960
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:20,754
so they're not like, I'm unsure about something
or I'm sad about something, but I'm seeing two cases

961
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,192
where regime of attention applies
it doesn't apply in this current model.

962
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,128
Two regimes of attention.

963
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:34,568
One would be like an intra model regime of attention,
like we could have in this agent

964
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:40,742
a metacognitive attentional layer that is either paying attention or not

965
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,711
to sensory outcomes.

966
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,348
And if they're not paying attention to it, it's going to slip by.
And it's like the gradient is flat.

967
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,351
And then the more attention they pay, the sharper

968
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:56,191
they're going to realize their preferences is like,
wow, it is really sunny out here and I prefer red light.

969
01:24:56,691 --> 01:25:06,267
So I'm going to go because I was brought my attention to it
then there's sort of this like XO model where you're talking about

970
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:14,175
bringing people's attention to different parts of the model
now that itself could be an active recursive model,

971
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:21,483
but that's like using this model to draw, to both expand
people's to the space of the possible

972
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:29,023
and then direct their regime of attention to certain phenomena
or attributes of this model.

973
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:35,363
So there's I think there's a link
to little bit separate uses, but they both apply.

974
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,767
It do you think do you think the second one

975
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:46,741
because if I go or I don't go, both of them
give me a feedback loop that I learn from right

976
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:50,645
so do you think the second one is

977
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,650
nuanced, different than the first or

978
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,387
quite radically different from the first?

979
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:04,892
Because I know if I don't go
that's quite, quite different, that's the zero.

980
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,894
And if I do go, that's the one there.

981
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:10,532
They're they're quite separable and quite discrete.

982
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:20,340
What is what you're describing more of that blur I wasn't in
on the third one I think was where there was no line drawn in the sand

983
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:27,916
and so I'm wondering
and now I'm wondering about that because again, ultimately,

984
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:34,622
if we could take this off the page and use it and actually use it
in ways that give us more prediction matter, expertize

985
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:36,758
boom,

986
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,495
so what do you think?

987
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:43,565
Yeah, let me type something, Stephen.

988
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,333
Anything, two other

989
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,603
I do. You do.

990
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:53,575
And I'll say what I was going to say. So ads for
this is slightly different point.

991
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:56,044
So I want to just let you finish this point and then.

992
01:26:56,077 --> 01:27:07,088
OK, so the first case of the regime of attention is going to be we do a
recursive layer in this agent's so that they can be paying attention to

993
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,158
something or not. OK? Yep.

994
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,760
Yeah, time, energy, a lot done. Yeah.

995
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:21,002
So the second the sort of application
or communication of the model would be deploying this,

996
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,671
I don't even know.

997
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:26,341
It's like a meta slash exo model.

998
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:32,080
Like bring deploy. Are you,
are you coming up with new ways of describing things?

999
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:34,816
Not during a livestream.

1000
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:38,253
We don't do that. We do that before and then we rehearse remember?

1001
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:45,259
So you could use this model to bring the policy planners
attention to something.

1002
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,232
So again, you distinguished
there was first just stating the space of the possible.

1003
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:57,538
So that's not an active secret like the the policy planner, right?

1004
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,608
Oh, I guess I never really thought
people would move from the park to the cafe.

1005
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,445
Oh, I was thinking how people would get to the park

1006
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,348
and then how they'd get to the cafe,
but I didn't realize that they would move between them.

1007
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,151
Maybe that literally happens.

1008
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,720
So that's just like a movement matrix.

1009
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:22,463
Any kind of systems thinking or design thinking or agent
based model would converge on that, any kind of iterated modeling.

1010
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:25,433
OK, but we're talking about what

1011
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:32,073
active could direct their regime of attention towards.

1012
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:38,613
So let's just say that we had a nice polished dashboard for this cafe

1013
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:43,651
movement simulation, and then we had two kinds of

1014
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:45,453
people.

1015
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,890
Somebody with visual scenario A and visual scenario B.

1016
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,894
So maybe it could be anything.

1017
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:57,965
It could be their their preferences over ramps, children love ramps.

1018
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,567
Some people cannot move up them.

1019
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:01,336
Some people love Bright, some people loved art.

1020
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:07,542
OK, so you can say there are we're going to just say
there's two kinds of agents

1021
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:12,647
in this simulation and we'd like to bring your attention.

1022
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:16,050
Policy planner right.

1023
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:25,593
Your preference over observations, which is like local businesses
being intact, people hanging out in the park during these times a day.

1024
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:28,463
You have these preferences over observations.

1025
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:35,837
We're kind of meeting
you and we're seeing those your observations are our outputs.

1026
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:42,276
Our model is outputting the things that you are observing and caring

1027
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:48,182
and preferring over we've done a suite of model explorations

1028
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:54,922
and it seems a little counterintuitive,
but adding a red streetlight in the park

1029
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,964
changes how people use it to it.

1030
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:08,536
Nope, nobody would have suggested the Red Street light
but we know that there's people who love red light,

1031
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:14,108
and it turns out that just having one red street light,
it makes it great for them.

1032
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:18,012
That has totally changed the flow.

1033
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,549
Steady state, non equilibrium, steady state

1034
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,584
reflecting in a tractor in our model.

1035
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:33,628
Yeah, that has changed and we can see these suite of simulations
that and we're just going to call your attention to this graph

1036
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:40,201
and call your attention to how the points go higher on the y axis
as the x axis dial changes.

1037
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,471
But it turns out we don't want only red light in the park.

1038
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:50,611
So we ran a simulation from zero to one, right and sun
half and half and every combination.

1039
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:56,184
And so there's some curve and we'll draw your attention to the point
where that curve is.

1040
01:30:56,818 --> 01:31:04,325
That's a great first step and we'll iterate because it's an open source
model and we're in conversation with you and then we'll be able to test

1041
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:12,567
so the map and then the allocation of numbers on the map
is kind of like the regime of attention.

1042
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:20,007
That's our affordances as modelers
and then there's that layer of communicating it clearly

1043
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:29,349
with strings of natural and computer language and visuals
so that the regime of attention of something not in your model

1044
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:36,590
at the core level, like the policy planner, they're like,
Oh yeah, I guess I do expect and prefer this,

1045
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:41,996
and here's somebody who's giving me that expectation and preference

1046
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:46,800
and a toolkit for counterfactuals and elaboration.

1047
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:54,642
And their outcomes are my incomes OK.

1048
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:55,776
Thank you.

1049
01:31:56,444 --> 01:32:01,382
No, but that's I think that's helpful because at the end of the day,

1050
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:09,724
there there's somebody who's actually observing this
and putting it into, into each one of these cells.

1051
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:14,228
But I'm not sure that that the people that are actually doing it
are necessarily aware of it.

1052
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:19,934
And so my question is, once they become aware of it,
what can they do with what's the value to that?

1053
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:22,036
Yeah.

1054
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:26,040
So it's like the first ring of the model, you know,
the person is moving.

1055
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:29,610
We could do mean field approximation, really simple.

1056
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:32,380
We could do the trajectory based particle simulation

1057
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:40,755
OK, then what's outside of our model
and the sort of boutique step is communicating to the policy planner.

1058
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:45,959
But now let's just say that I, the modeler, include the policy planner

1059
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,931
in this model or they have a different model.

1060
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:55,202
Now, the outcome of the that model is being passed to me.

1061
01:32:56,771 --> 01:33:03,510
So you never get around the notion
that there's like a boutique level of communication of the model.

1062
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:12,519
But the idea is that like critical infrastructure could be inside
the model and the boutique communication could be to the public.

1063
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:18,659
And then we would have functional infrastructure and good communication

1064
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,729
instead of

1065
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:27,602
little sub ad hoc modules for critical infrastructure
with boutique communication among them.

1066
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:33,540
So that any tenuous wrapper drawn around all the critical infrastructure
is going to be incoherent,

1067
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:38,546
then that incoherent blanket cannot be communicated out.

1068
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,581
Another level. Yep.

1069
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:45,753
I think you reinforcing the idea of the difference
between structuralism and interaction

1070
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,522
and what you're describing there is kind of the way finder rule

1071
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:54,695
there are coinciding with the person who's wayfinding

1072
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:58,833
stuff. Cool

1073
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:09,543
maybe we'll have templates, guidebooks, playbooks, workshop,
all those things, like what is the right order?

1074
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:12,947
They're probably not only one order, but again,

1075
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:21,122
if we don't have a model to discuss, it's
going to be like getting to point one and then to zero.

1076
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:26,994
And then there's the grass and the grass is alive
and in the grasses, viruses and are viruses alive and what is green?

1077
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:29,797
It's like kind of these like false starts

1078
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:31,932
but I think once

1079
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:39,907
it connects, even conceptually, we didn't write this in code, it's
not even pseudocode, but once it conceptually connects

1080
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:45,312
and then we can say, OK, let's make Affordance Matrix E one
and then let's make E two.

1081
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:51,452
So just like it's an alternate hypothesis on the Affordance matrix,
then we have, you know, a

1082
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:56,957
one and a two, just two hypotheses on the mapping between
hidden states and observations.

1083
01:34:57,558 --> 01:35:00,761
And then we're going to run a two by two model simulation.

1084
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:05,232
E one, A1, E1 A2, e to a one, e two A2.

1085
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,303
Now we're doing decision supports

1086
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:17,845
and it's up to us because that's the on models is our decisions,
our preferences over the outcomes that we're seeing.

1087
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,281
Oh, I like the E2 A1

1088
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:24,618
because I prefer people to be in the park.

1089
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:29,223
And then the cafe owner says, I looked at that one and I liked that one.

1090
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:37,498
Oh, we're modeling ourselves, making this decision, and you like people
to be in the park, and I like people to be in the cafe.

1091
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:43,036
We have a different preference, so we're not going to eliminate tension,

1092
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:53,214
but that's actually a conversation to have versus I consulted this group
and they made this PDF and you did this and they did it a word file.

1093
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:57,183
It's a different file type. They wrote in a different language.

1094
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,321
They're not informationally integrated.

1095
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:03,057
What is the comparison? Cool.

1096
01:36:03,624 --> 01:36:05,526
You know, a consultant.

1097
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:08,496
But then this is a way where it's

1098
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,266
people may call it transparent.

1099
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:20,875
I'm not sure how transparent massive statistical models
will ever truly be, but maybe it's kind of like a transparent engine.

1100
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:25,312
It doesn't mean it's made of glass.
It means like there's a window into it.

1101
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:30,718
So here we can see the pieces going in. There's no side door.

1102
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:32,820
There's no other matrix.

1103
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:39,192
If we specify the partially observable Markov decision process, the MVP,
those are the pieces that went in

1104
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,929
and the connectors are also established.

1105
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:48,134
Then we used a message passing algorithm
or some other approach to find parameters.

1106
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:53,407
So which part of that would you like us to interact on?

1107
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,978
I mean, that's an actual conversation.

1108
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:04,585
And then even if somebody doesn't know about one part,
they could still be included in that dialog.

1109
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:08,122
Perhaps. Stephen Yeah.

1110
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:12,526
And that that again, you touched on it,
you kind of circle back to a couple times

1111
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:17,665
and you actually used the word support
whether it's support or serve or contribute.

1112
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:23,671
That's kind of the one constant, regardless of what
how it, how it sketches out.

1113
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:32,012
That's the one thing that seems to run through this as a constant what,
how active inference actually supports

1114
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:37,051
what, what inevitably gets kicked over.

1115
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,953
But we observe at the end of the day.

1116
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:45,893
Right, like we're doing this, we're using limited high energy electrons
and our attention

1117
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:52,166
and our finite life and everything like that, all these resources
so that we can have decision support in this example.

1118
01:37:52,633 --> 01:38:00,474
And then we undertake a policy that modifies the niche, modifies
the generative process, but that's on mild.

1119
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:04,712
Again, we are at the first level
where we don't even have the construction site.

1120
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:14,488
So then we have the model where I can choose to change a light bulb
from the you know, maybe we can add a natural light into the cafe

1121
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:17,057
that would be the next.

1122
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:23,130
That would be like an active model of agents using an active model.

1123
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:28,669
And then that model would still have this boutique layer
that has to be communicated

1124
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:31,739
informally.

1125
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:38,445
And that's like kind of the connective tissue
where you have something that's like a MDP interfacing with the world.

1126
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,049
It has to have some sort of an interface like that.

1127
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:44,151
Steven then.

1128
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,687
You know, I think this is really helpful.

1129
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:52,892
The affordances thinking of affordances is effectively
the setting up for the action policy

1130
01:38:52,893 --> 01:39:00,467
and the generative Genesis model
so you say, OK, in this case this affordances to better stay or move.

1131
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:09,243
And what I think is really helpful,
I'm excited about is and this sort of comes down to those two like

1132
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:15,916
so the dynamic availability or the, the
this could be happening at different rates.

1133
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:21,188
You can have the same model that's here nested at different speeds.

1134
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:25,592
Let's not use the tempo rates of recursion, i.e.

1135
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:27,361
this is a general idea.

1136
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:31,932
There's someone coming,
they go to the cafe and they chose to go to a part of the cafe.

1137
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:36,503
This might be happening over ten, 20 seconds
and they make a choice of where they are.

1138
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:42,543
There might be something about people
leaving the cafe and certain areas over the period of 10 minutes,

1139
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:50,084
but there's also like I'm walking towards a cafe
and I can be making choices.

1140
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:51,885
I can be making

1141
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:55,823
an intuition about what affordances to stay or move.

1142
01:39:55,923 --> 01:40:02,996
I go in the cafes or go to the park and I can be thinking about,
I can turn, I can change my position.

1143
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:09,837
I could, I could be flipping off shopping next year
maybe once every half a second over a period of maybe 10 seconds.

1144
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,440
And then once I walk through the door, I'm in the queue

1145
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:17,444
I'm pretty much like

1146
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:21,982
in I'm going to be staying for a while, right?
So now I'm in the right now.

1147
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:31,357
So my the rate at which the same idea of the affordances being used
could be now happiness is slightly different nested speeds, right?

1148
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:36,830
Because, OK, that's if I'll maybe choose
I mean here now I'm going to say for a minute or I know I sit down

1149
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,067
and then it's like I'm getting into a good conversation,
am I going to stay for 10 minutes?

1150
01:40:40,634 --> 01:40:43,537
And they're different, but they're the same in some ways.

1151
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,407
So they're different Chronos.

1152
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:52,713
But there's a cross that links the timeliness together
and that's why categorical

1153
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:58,218
cybernetics and event oriented cognition like Martin Boots is recent
guess stream.

1154
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:03,390
The event is I'm ordering there's a beginning and an end to that.

1155
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:07,261
Now, within that matrix or within that event context,

1156
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:11,298
it could be playing out at a second by second.

1157
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:16,203
But then in a different event context, it can be a different model.

1158
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:20,240
And the higher level is which context am I in? What is the event?

1159
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:27,181
So that I think will go a very long way
towards going from like that kind of

1160
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:37,290
auto ethnographic narrative of like I was, I was dangling
and I was moving my elbows sort of in that event context.

1161
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:45,766
You do have the model like I was getting a taxi maybe that has
a different spatial temporal scale, different set of affordances.

1162
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:51,672
And then for our model not for the real world, which isn't changing,

1163
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:59,813
but then in our model we say, OK, once you're in the taxi,
the event is in taxi and we're only going to look at block by block,

1164
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:07,019
or then we slow the model down in the simulation or something like that
when the event context changes

1165
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:11,024
and then we're doing inference at the higher level
on which of that context we're in.

1166
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:14,094
So we would have a way to talk about that

1167
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:21,101
and iterate and include all the richness in the sub matrices
and pull back to the core screen when we have to do that.

1168
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:22,603
Dean.

1169
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:26,940
This is fantastic because it's really helping me.

1170
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:28,976
I hope it's helping me.

1171
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,277
Everybody else is watching and participating.

1172
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:33,313
So again,

1173
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:37,550
what I'm hearing is a very clear line being drawn between something.

1174
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:45,325
What we might describe as goal, direct behavior
and the relationship that we're trying to proscribe in three tables.

1175
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:51,098
And it's the relationship between those three tables
as opposed to a specific outcome

1176
01:42:51,331 --> 01:43:02,075
which we in our minds say we want to achieve or realized
or recapitulate versus building out a relationship through support,

1177
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,646
through serving through contribution.

1178
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:13,152
But that is
that is not a goal that stays on the relational level, never to collapse

1179
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:20,961
underneath that out of that plots out these goals
that can be directed behaviorally.

1180
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:22,796
But then if I'm

1181
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:24,063
if I'm

1182
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:30,537
misinterpreting this, where am I laying something over this
that reconfirms my biases push back on this?

1183
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:36,777
But I think what we continue to do
is reinforce the difference between what we're doing here.

1184
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:42,983
In terms of a model and what effects that can potentiate versus a model

1185
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:49,122
that has a specific and an idealized and a particular outcome.

1186
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,893
Am I am I overstepping or overreaching?

1187
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,795
No. Thanks for sharing how you see it.

1188
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:59,866
I think the only piece I caught on is goal isn't an active ontology.

1189
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,670
We have preferences and expectations, and then we adjust.

1190
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:08,275
We trim tab so that we realize those observations.

1191
01:44:08,675 --> 01:44:14,615
And so it's like,
I want to be under the finish line at the four minute and 52nd mile.

1192
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:17,517
That's the observation I want.

1193
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:20,687
Not my goal is to run a 450 mile.

1194
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:24,825
So then there's actually policy selection, how you get there.

1195
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:29,162
And this is from a paper that I'll release very, very soon.

1196
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:35,235
Here's just a re visualization of the MVP that we've seen many times.

1197
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:44,778
It's a little bit adapted from the Mental Action Sandford Smith Paper
and a few other sources, but basically we have this discrete time play

1198
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,383
and then we have see the preferences

1199
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:56,590
e the affordances, the possible policies that can be taken and G,
which is the expected free energy calculation.

1200
01:44:56,857 --> 01:44:58,825
That's the minimization component.

1201
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:07,166
Those play into Pi PI influences B
which is the state transition mapping of underlying hidden states.

1202
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:12,706
In our model,
that was where one is inferred to be, but not what they're observing.

1203
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:17,010
B is only changing how states transfer to each other.

1204
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:23,917
A which we had is the sense
mapping matrix is mapping from the observations which were photons

1205
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:26,353
emitted by the generative process, the niche.

1206
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:31,725
A is intermediating between the photon
and the inference on where you are.

1207
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:35,862
Sometimes it's really obvious
if it's dark, you're not in a cafe or the park.

1208
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:38,832
If it's red, you're more likely to be in the cafe.

1209
01:45:39,266 --> 01:45:44,004
You used to be totally likely,
but now you're pretty sure because we added that red light to the park.

1210
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:50,344
And then there's uncertainty estimates
which can be fixed or learned on all of this.

1211
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:58,118
And this is not the only model architecture
this is a model architecture that we're using to integrate

1212
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:03,990
perception, cognition and action and impact service contribution
Stephen.

1213
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:06,793
Yeah, thanks.

1214
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:11,098
Then it's really helpful and talking about these three to relating.

1215
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:17,070
So as the model is at the moment, you know, the top Affordance matrix
which gives the policy options,

1216
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:22,108
you know, it's giving us sort of the states the possible choices.

1217
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:24,111
So it's fairly set. Okay.

1218
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:28,815
But those the sense mapping in the preference preference matrix

1219
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:36,889
and you could put that temperature into that or you could put variation
of how much So for instance, at certain scales,

1220
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:41,928
you know, generally speaking,
the movement was red when I went to the cafe.

1221
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:45,332
But when you're in the cafe and the lights, maybe the sun goes behind,

1222
01:46:45,766 --> 01:46:52,873
the cloud comes out again, you know, maybe in different,
there's different rates at which that can be fluctuating a little bit.

1223
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:55,442
Maybe my preferences as I'm starting

1224
01:46:55,442 --> 01:47:01,681
to think about what I like in cafes in general, and then I'm say, well,
you know what I actually quite like in this one, right?

1225
01:47:02,549 --> 01:47:05,252
So but what this does with even within this model

1226
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,387
is, you know, you could

1227
01:47:07,387 --> 01:47:14,161
start to not only change the values,
but you could change how much the values either

1228
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:21,635
just by temperature or noise fluctuation
or maybe there's a tempo of oscillation.

1229
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:28,442
You know, maybe you say that this one goes has the ability to change
within these premises over a five second period,

1230
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:32,112
over a five minute period, or what's happening below perception.

1231
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:38,919
You know, there's a because with circadian, so you could say, okay,
maybe someone doesn't notice there's a dark part of the room

1232
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:41,421
because it's just one table in the corner, right?

1233
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:50,263
So there's something nice about even within this model,
you've got the ability to start to get this nested hierarchy.

1234
01:47:50,997 --> 01:47:51,631
Yeah.

1235
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:59,706
Like if you have uncertainty and you allow the parameters
to be learnable in your model, not debating whether people

1236
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:05,278
actually are learning, just we're going to test two models, one
where they cannot learn the mapping,

1237
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:10,717
one where they can learn the mapping,
or we're going to test one where it's just visual versus a sense

1238
01:48:11,585 --> 01:48:17,357
it might smell like coffee more outside in the park than in the café
because that's where they vent.

1239
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:20,494
So that could be learned and understood.

1240
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:25,198
And somebody at the first part oh, of course
it's going to smell more like coffee in the cafe. It might not.

1241
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:28,201
So it doesn't have to be the direction people expect.

1242
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:34,374
It can be included in the prior D
That was the only letter they didn't mention was

1243
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:43,817
that's how you get to the first state in the Markov
chain is with the prior and so you can have high uncertainty over prior.

1244
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:52,259
Just say like I don't know where I am and I'm very uncertain or
I'm certain I don't know where I am or any other number of combinations.

1245
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:53,226
And then

1246
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,931
the Bayesian information criterion,
just to add like one more little technical note.

1247
01:48:58,665 --> 01:49:03,870
So the by sea, it's really just the AIC
but the by sea, it's basically it's a value.

1248
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:09,175
Bic is going to be something related to the number of parameters.

1249
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:14,414
That's the key term that's the number of parameters times
the natural log of a number of data points.

1250
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:17,851
So that's like are you fitting 50 parameters on one data point?

1251
01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:22,889
I mean, you can imagine that those are going to be very poor
estimates versus like one parameter on 50.

1252
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:28,028
So then that one parameter that's not the world, right? It's a model.

1253
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:33,967
We're talking about statistical modeling -2 times
the natural log of the likelihood function.

1254
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:38,071
So this is like model complexity minus model accuracy.

1255
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:43,076
So then we can say, OK, I'm testing three different Affordance Matrixes.

1256
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:49,316
One is the three by three, one is a nine by nine
because I've split each of the zones

1257
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:55,155
into three parts and there's like the window was very sunny
and then 5050 and then a very red part.

1258
01:49:55,855 --> 01:50:00,192
And then I have another one where it's 500 by 500
and like the first ten columns are the same

1259
01:50:00,694 --> 01:50:05,732
because like they're all sunny and then the second one are all the same
and they're very similar to the first ten.

1260
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:07,601
One can

1261
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:12,739
imagine that depending on what kind of data they have
and how much data they have,

1262
01:50:13,807 --> 01:50:21,748
they might find that the by sea
for the three by three, nine by nine or 9000 by 9000 model is supported.

1263
01:50:22,582 --> 01:50:26,486
And so that wouldn't be saying
the territory is three by three, nine or 900.

1264
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:32,058
It wouldn't even be saying that the map is three by 39 by nine, 9000.

1265
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:39,898
It'd be like saying this is a Perito optimal Bayes
optimal statistical model

1266
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:46,773
that's on a frontier manifolds between explaining variance
while reducing model complexity.

1267
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:55,682
So it's like that's the level above the map
and that's where the by sea and model selection comes into play.

1268
01:50:56,149 --> 01:51:00,787
You don't just do the bottom up
and then finish your model at the zero to one.

1269
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:02,255
That's the iterating.

1270
01:51:02,255 --> 01:51:12,866
We could have a whole network or matrix of models and then have
principled ways of selecting among them and adding a new data.

1271
01:51:13,233 --> 01:51:15,368
Designing Counterfactuals.

1272
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:25,045
What would be the most informative data point to obtain or what would be
a perturbation that would distinguish these two different hypotheses?

1273
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:34,187
Those are the kind of maximum information foraging questions
because they amount to which policy as a modeler

1274
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:42,362
will reduce my uncertainty about dot, dot, dot
that might be formalized in this matter Excel model,

1275
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:45,065
or it might not be,

1276
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:49,903
but we can use like active quant as our kernel

1277
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:55,942
and then active qual as our wrapper hashtag dot coms.

1278
01:51:56,943 --> 01:51:59,546
Dave and then Steven.

1279
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:10,290
Have activities of navigating among models at various scales
and topologies that you, as you've been describing,

1280
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:20,467
have those been observed adequately to tell to
what degree free energy is being minimized during that evolution?

1281
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:24,537
That's a great question.

1282
01:52:24,537 --> 01:52:28,241
Potentially for Marten Boots or for someone else,

1283
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:39,018
which is kind of the first principles, unifying theory angle,
which we didn't even mention today in Active would be like this

1284
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:46,726
would we have a common currency
or could we understand actions selected in different contexts

1285
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:52,832
as being in the same game of reducing expected free energy?

1286
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,469
So then could we look at

1287
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:01,907
like we have the sub matrices within Cafe Park and neither

1288
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:10,650
and then like we're looking at the fine scale transitions
as in a free energy minimizing process and the macro transition.

1289
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:13,887
And then looking at how like

1290
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:18,825
small and large changes in expected free energy are related to sort of

1291
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:22,829
micro and macro transitions in a hierarchical model is all you're asking

1292
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:25,565
yeah.

1293
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:30,202
Whether using this modeling framework

1294
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:35,742
exhibits the kind of behavior that allows you to evaluate

1295
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:39,345
the free energy principle and its friends

1296
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:43,082
plot in the real world.

1297
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:47,654
And for one thing, are people just plain turning on data collection
adequately?

1298
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:55,795
Dunnicliff did that weigh decades ago when he was developing latex,
he turned on this massive data collection

1299
01:53:55,795 --> 01:54:02,769
everybody in his organization was feeding in exactly to the key
press is being captured.

1300
01:54:02,769 --> 01:54:08,074
And then he ran matrix metrics on that and says, well,
this is where we're putting our attention.

1301
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:13,245
I'm trying to make things easier
and I'm making them harder. Well, that's wrong. Let's start working.

1302
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:19,552
And if you hadn't collect the data, you know, he would
he wouldn't have been able to give

1303
01:54:19,552 --> 01:54:27,160
all those speeches about how how it worked
and how you study the ecology of software development.

1304
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,929
This stuff is a lot cooler than anything that he ever did.

1305
01:54:30,964 --> 01:54:33,499
I think that we're moving from a zero to one

1306
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:40,138
to a continuous deployment of models landscape, which puts us squarely

1307
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:46,779
within the scope of active because we're no longer doing
descriptive analysis, like how was this car made?

1308
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:52,685
We're doing like continuous deployment on the ship, a thesis,
and that is going to give a lot more information

1309
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:58,424
and then whatever information is collected will respect that as being

1310
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:01,060
observations.

1311
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:07,834
So whether we have every keypress and every mouse movement
and the pupil diameter and the eye gaze and the natural language

1312
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:14,407
processing on the live stream and, and, and all of those things,
it's still would just be observations

1313
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:22,248
and let them debate whether it's all them ones that we need,
but then we'll specify our matrices we'll use.

1314
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:25,985
I see iterate with the real world. And

1315
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:30,023
yeah, I think that between the git commits

1316
01:55:30,356 --> 01:55:35,594
and the language use and the absolute accuracy or validity of the model,

1317
01:55:36,162 --> 01:55:42,635
there would be quite some interesting patterns to see like does
as the accuracy versus git commits.

1318
01:55:43,069 --> 01:55:48,474
Do you like go really fast up and then dip and then recover accuracy.

1319
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:52,879
Do you have a prolonged period of low accuracy followed by like a phase?

1320
01:55:52,879 --> 01:56:02,188
Transition was like, oh, once we added in the sense of smell,
it just was like, wow, then it fit or is it like some other dynamic?

1321
01:56:02,422 --> 01:56:04,824
Or how does that relate to the language use?

1322
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:08,260
How does it relate to the saliva cortisol metabolite?

1323
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:14,701
Like there's no end to what you could bring into the model
because they're just observations.

1324
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:20,840
And then the relationships among different kinds of observations
is something that's learned

1325
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:26,846
and we'll use the besi and related techniques
like Bayesian model reduction and structure learning,

1326
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:35,788
which first and pointed to as the key open problem
in the DART tools section of our June 21 symposium structure.

1327
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:44,429
Learning is how you go from just proposing variants on matrices
and exploding your model space

1328
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:52,472
to actually finding models that are on that frontier of being useful
so very interesting question, Dave.

1329
01:56:52,472 --> 01:56:53,339
Thank you, Stephen.

1330
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:57,543
That way I want to give closing closing round of thoughts there now.

1331
01:56:57,543 --> 01:57:01,114
So I will just say that
that was really helpful to have this diagram here.

1332
01:57:01,114 --> 01:57:07,954
So just because you got
so you got preferences and affordances for action straddling,

1333
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:17,230
you can see my hands straddling the strategy which is coming
from all the sensory kind of interpretation, so to speak.

1334
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:19,264
And one question I've got is

1335
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:26,839
you know, you got uncertainties there and I know this
just purely more from an instrumental kind of practical point is

1336
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:33,780
as it influences at the moment, that's kind of like I suppose
you could have a big matrix and the uncertainties could be flips.

1337
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:35,514
They flip on and off what's available.

1338
01:57:35,515 --> 01:57:40,953
It's like you can move, you can't maybe you have to stay,
maybe at some point you've got no choice. You've got to stay right

1339
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:44,424
whereas in the other ones the numbers.

1340
01:57:44,424 --> 01:57:48,428
So it could be you could vary them so you would try and change.

1341
01:57:48,828 --> 01:57:53,399
You would you would treat those matrices slightly differently
because the other one, you need the switch and on and off

1342
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,968
options for what you could do.

1343
01:57:55,968 --> 01:58:03,675
And down, low down, you could do something to change that number
between either zero and one or whatever.

1344
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:07,647
So just wondering what your thoughts are on that. Yes.

1345
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:11,984
So this is just one architecture and one representations.

1346
01:58:11,984 --> 01:58:16,923
I'd be totally open to being wrong in these points,
but I'll just bring up what I think is interesting about that.

1347
01:58:18,157 --> 01:58:23,229
Notice that the uncertainty is on a not oh, so you could say

1348
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:32,572
my thermometer says 22.2, but I don't know how that maps
to the real temperature because it's a noisy thermometer.

1349
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:38,077
That's zero ambiguity about the thermometer.

1350
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:42,515
So if but if you say, I'm not even sure what the thermometer says,

1351
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:46,319
it's 20 something,

1352
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:56,062
then you need another model with what is the visual observation
mapping to the thermometer reading, mapping to the temperature.

1353
01:58:56,462 --> 01:58:58,831
So uncertainty in that.

1354
01:58:58,831 --> 01:59:02,301
Just one interesting point is it's not connected to Oh I see.

1355
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:04,837
But of course we have uncertainty about what we're seeing.

1356
01:59:04,837 --> 01:59:06,172
It's a blur, right?

1357
01:59:06,172 --> 01:59:11,309
But if you don't even know if you saw it or not,
you're even another level removed.

1358
01:59:11,544 --> 01:59:16,315
So you could be uncertain about the mapping from whatever
the thermometer says to temperature.

1359
01:59:16,315 --> 01:59:20,419
The extreme case being you're so uncertain about the mapping of a that

1360
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:27,660
even when you visually see it says 22, you're just like,
I literally got no information on the real temp or if a take mapping.

1361
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:35,101
But that's one thing that doesn't have an uncertainty associated with it
and he had not that it couldn't is just that maybe it doesn't need to

1362
01:59:35,668 --> 01:59:42,474
and then the other one is as you pointed out
there's no uncertainty over PI

1363
01:59:44,544 --> 01:59:47,113
that I find quite interesting

1364
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:54,085
and I think the reason why is we're not doing inference on PI

1365
01:59:55,421 --> 02:00:01,994
we're conditioning all of our analysis,
conditioning our free energy calculation

1366
02:00:03,429 --> 02:00:05,598
horizontally. In on PI.

1367
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:08,733
So we're saying there's three options

1368
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:16,741
and I'm conditioning the expected free energy of one, two
or three conditioned on selecting one, two or three.

1369
02:00:18,444 --> 02:00:20,746
So it is a little bit of a different variable.

1370
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:23,182
And also action is not in this.

1371
02:00:23,182 --> 02:00:29,188
It's implicitly in there because the B matrix,
which we can have uncertainty on in how the B matrix,

1372
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:32,425
how policy's map to be and how B maps to states.

1373
02:00:33,492 --> 02:00:39,232
So a technical phrasing would have to clarify like,
you know what, I drew the red line here to the middle of the edge.

1374
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:46,072
Is that an uncertainty on the mapping of PI to be or is that a
mapping on so it's not a technical claim, it's a visual artifact.

1375
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:51,677
But I think it might be possible to have no uncertainty on observation

1376
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:55,181
and no uncertainty on policy

1377
02:00:55,781 --> 02:01:02,755
and that could just compress the computational complexity
by a huge amount

1378
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:08,327
and all the other ambiguity
could actually be like very nicely dealt with elsewhere.

1379
02:01:08,995 --> 02:01:12,098
But if it's like

1380
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:18,671
I'm just thinking of other examples, people can probably imagine
if there's uncertainty on what policy you're conditioning on.

1381
02:01:19,472 --> 02:01:25,577
I think the analysis starts to lose sense
like conditioned on left to right.

1382
02:01:25,578 --> 02:01:32,051
Am I going to get the food that makes sense, conditioned on I'm
not sure if I'm going left or right

1383
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:36,022
I don't see how there could be anything other than

1384
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,392
you don't know

1385
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:46,464
it's not a conditional,
so you can't get a marginal likelihood from a Bayesian perspective.

1386
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:49,368
So yeah. Stephen Yeah.

1387
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:53,806
Last last, last point, I suppose it's that question saying just do it
type of thing, isn't it?

1388
02:01:53,806 --> 02:01:57,108
With a policy is like you've got the option of just doing it right?

1389
02:01:57,109 --> 02:02:00,713
So you say, OK, I'm just going to, I'm going to do it and run with it.

1390
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:08,254
So I don't have the benefit of actually then going
and starting to tweak it all the time.

1391
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:10,523
But you've got that all round.

1392
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:16,195
The point is this put it all around it in the conditionality
I think you just said and then run it. And then

1393
02:02:17,196 --> 02:02:21,901
I suppose it is it is what it is and it's about some of these
the best you've got.

1394
02:02:22,468 --> 02:02:29,008
So, you know, if you're an organism, basically
the policy you've got is the policy you've got, though

1395
02:02:29,041 --> 02:02:32,144
you know, you can
you can go back and change your preferences because of what you did.

1396
02:02:32,144 --> 02:02:38,284
And ultimately that's all you got, you know,
so maybe you just have to sort of run with it.

1397
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:43,656
And you'll either resist dissipation or not.

1398
02:02:43,656 --> 02:02:46,192
Dean and then Dave, if you'd like a closing thought.

1399
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:50,929
Yeah. Mike So here's my closing thought

1400
02:02:50,996 --> 02:02:55,868
so today we basically pulled out a material relationship on that slide.

1401
02:02:55,868 --> 02:03:01,941
We built it in real time
and we were making a comparison to the material city of a city state.

1402
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:05,611
I think to bring it back to the paper.

1403
02:03:05,611 --> 02:03:12,485
Back to the paper note, I think this is really important
because I actually support a lot of what what the what Surveil wrote.

1404
02:03:13,919 --> 02:03:19,525
And I also believe that what we were talking about
was material generative models

1405
02:03:20,626 --> 02:03:23,662
out of that, there's a kind of a parallel

1406
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:26,866
to an iterative process.

1407
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:29,034
All right.

1408
02:03:29,034 --> 02:03:34,673
So even in even in the diagram that you have up here,
this is kind of confirming iteration.

1409
02:03:35,374 --> 02:03:39,812
So whether that iteration is in iterating, filling in

1410
02:03:41,013 --> 02:03:43,582
a table versus it being blank, right.

1411
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:53,993
There's an iteration process or the city grew from 12 buildings
to to 1200 that's an iterative process or, or whatever.

1412
02:03:55,161 --> 02:04:04,170
We've got multiple multiple confirmations of the fact that at scale
iteration is it is a thing, it's a material thing.

1413
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:10,308
What I'm going to go away from today's conversation
because I don't know the answer to this, but no, I got to think about

1414
02:04:10,309 --> 02:04:16,248
this is so when we when we move away from those things that fall out,

1415
02:04:16,749 --> 02:04:22,588
those those capitulations that fall out in terms of skyscrapers and

1416
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:26,058
nine by nines from three by threes,

1417
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:35,768
do we trust the map where the blueprint where do we trust the process
meaning critical path in the same material way?

1418
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:38,971
Because I think in the in the point one

1419
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:45,210
as you said, Daniel, we're just talking about zero to one right now,
but at some point we're going to have to get past one.

1420
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:47,947
And yet the real bootstrapping going

1421
02:04:48,547 --> 02:04:54,853
and then the question is, do we have to now incorporate
something to get outside of scale free for that to make sense?

1422
02:04:54,854 --> 02:05:01,193
And that's going to be my question to myself
is do we materialize the trust in these models

1423
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:05,631
the same way as we materialize the model themselves?

1424
02:05:06,131 --> 02:05:12,271
That's going to be my I'm going to go think about that for a few hours
because that would burn a few neurons for sure.

1425
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:14,473
It'll go up in smoke.

1426
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:19,311
But thank you for this
because this was really helpful to me. Incredibly helpful.

1427
02:05:20,646 --> 02:05:21,080
Thanks.

1428
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:26,151
You know, when I was in module stream one with Ryan and Christopher,

1429
02:05:27,219 --> 02:05:28,821
and they were going through it.

1430
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:30,856
And so

1431
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:38,430
there are better people and will be better people
to teach it and walk through it and they'll be a million ways to do it.

1432
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:42,101
So it's a funny thing that it happened in 33.2.

1433
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:45,237
A funny thing happened on the way to 33.3.

1434
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:50,776
But yeah.

1435
02:05:51,143 --> 02:05:53,913
Dave, any last comments?

1436
02:05:53,913 --> 02:06:02,955
Yeah, the question of uncertainty over
policy required means a lot of reflection and study.

1437
02:06:02,955 --> 02:06:09,094
And I would suggest one thing to look at is what exactly is repression

1438
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:14,266
like that's all I have to say for now.

1439
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:15,401
Yeah.

1440
02:06:16,502 --> 02:06:18,904
OK, fellows, thank you very much.

1441
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:26,211
Congrats to those who have listened to the end
and you're always welcome to participate in Active Lab.

1442
02:06:26,679 --> 02:06:31,083
So thanks again and peace out. Thanks to you. By.
