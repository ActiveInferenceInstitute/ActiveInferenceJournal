"Unknown","00;00;08;17","00;00;39;09","Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We're here on August 17th, 2021 in Livestream number 26.2. On the second discussion that we're having as a group on the paper, Bayesian Mechanics for stationary processes. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this page."
"Unknown","00;00;40;02","00;01;05;28","This is a recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following video etiquette for Livestream so we can use the Raise Hand feature in Gypsy. This short link has the upcoming live stream discussions. Here we are on August 17th in our last discussion on this paper."
"Unknown","00;01;05;28","00;01;33;24","26.2. Next week we'll be heading into a new paper and we still have some openings in the coming weeks. So if anyone has a suggestion or an author to contact or wants to discuss their own paper, just let us know and we can try to make that happen today in active stream number 26.2, the goal is to continue learning and discussing and unpacking this awesome paper that we've been thinking about for the last few weeks."
"Unknown","00;01;34;05","00;01;54;24","Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes. And we're really appreciative that the first author is here to join with us and to learn with us, have fun with us. And this video is just going to be wherever we want to take it. So we have some questions prepared, but especially if anyone in the live chat has questions that'd be awesome."
"Unknown","00;01;54;24","00;02;16;07","And we can definitely address them. So we can just start with a quick introduction round and feel free just to say hello or to answer one of these questions. Like, What's something that you liked or remembered about the paper and what's something that you're wondering about or want to have resolved by the end of today? So I'm Daniel."
"Unknown","00;02;16;07","00;02;42;07","I'm a post-doctoral researcher in California, and something that over the last week made me excited to have this discussion was I was speaking with a physicist friend, someone who's working with lasers and oscilloscopes and stuff, and I brought up this paper and they it turned out that they actually were using PID control in their research on a day to day basis."
"Unknown","00;02;42;19","00;03;06;02","But actually it was new for them to hear about how it was connected to some of these broader topics. But as soon as I brought out the physical printed paper then they were just so excited and it was cool to see how they had all this practical experience working with PID. And then they instantly just saw that there was kind of this crossover point into some broader questions that also they were curious about."
"Unknown","00;03;06;02","00;03;38;18","But the day to day practice actually hadn't brought them to those general questions. So it was, you know, I learned a lot about PID control and about actually how it plays out with the knobs and everything like that. I'll pass to Dean. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, I came away from the paper again trying to figure out how to create some sort of a coherent narrative around the the the physical math and the statistical math."
"Unknown","00;03;38;18","00;03;57;22","That part for me really got me going away and thinking a little bit because I think they they go in different directions, but I do think that they can work in concert. So, yeah, I'd be really interested to see how that might play. Out in terms of what what our our guest here thinks, the directions this might be able to go."
"Unknown","00;03;57;22","00;04;40;04","I'll pass it to Stephen Hello. I'm Stephen, based in Toronto. I work a lot with community development and so spatial meaning making so inferences of different kinds. I'm curious how some of the ways that the mathematics have been done on this paper can help broaden some of the questions around urban decency and non consistency in that's a bit of a thorn sometimes a weapon in the in activist, active influenced dialog."
"Unknown","00;04;40;04","00;05;11;27","So yeah, and that's something I'd be interested in and I'm going to pass this over to Dave. So I think Dave doesn't have audio. But Dave, thanks for joining and any questions in the YouTube live chat is awesome. So thanks to everyone who's joined and past two lengths thanks Daniel and thanks for inviting me again. Some nice and easy student at Imperial and U.S.O. and I'm really excited to be here and to engage in this discussion."
"Unknown","00;05;12;22","00;05;46;07","I'm really looking forward to feedback about the papers, seeing what's interesting to pursue in future work I'm really looking forward to to share this paper with you and talk about it. So maybe one leading question before we jump to the content, what stage in your PhD are you and is this like the meat and potatoes? Chapter one or is this a little cul de sac that you found yourself having to explore in the course of another research project?"
"Unknown","00;05;47;20","00;06;13;16","You a great question. So I'm right in the middle of my Ph.D. and two years into I still have two years to go. And ideally, I would like to pursue this work. But so I have two supervisors. One is a mathematician, another one is a neuroscientist. And so really the goal is to have some kind of mathematical theory of how adaptive systems work."
"Unknown","00;06;13;17","00;06;39;10","So I think this is really the first chapter I want to push that further. But then there are also other approaches that take up my time. So trying to make all that work together awesome. So for this start too, we have some questions prepared, some topics that we know we want to talk about. But anyone who asks a question in the live chat will definitely have time to address that."
"Unknown","00;06;40;16","00;07;04;18","The paper that we've been talking about is this Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes, paper and in the dot zero and the dot one, there's more information on the primary aims and claims. So check those out if you haven't already. We're just going to take one more look at the road map, where we've been, where we're going. Remember, we were talking about Markov blankets and basic mechanics."
"Unknown","00;07;05;02","00;07;41;15","How does active inference have similarities and differences from other ways to model dynamical systems? And let's just go straight to the first question that we have, which is going to help us review where we've been. And then also as a jumping off point for some of these extended questions that we've already written. So a colleague asked me and said, I think it would be good to expand on the differences of the paradigms in Section three, and those are Section B, C, and related to a posteriori estimation after the fact, predictive processing and variational base."
"Unknown","00;07;41;15","00;08;05;17","So perhaps Lance first and then anyone else who wants to give a take or ask a follow up question, what are the similarities in the differences here and why were they structured in this order? Is this the chronological order is this most specific to least specific, or what is the ordering and the meaning here? Right. Yeah, so so the it goes from the simplest to the most sophisticated."
"Unknown","00;08;06;29","00;08;40;28","So obviously estimation is a special case of predictive processing, which is specific special case of variation on base. And so the idea is if you if you receive some piece of data. So for example, if you see an image with your eyes, you're going to try to infer what's going on outside in the environment. And so if you do have a serious dimension what you're trying to guess is what is the most likely thing like what is the most likely thing that's going on in the environment?"
"Unknown","00;08;41;27","00;08;58;26","So it could be she if you see an image of a chair, you would say, oh, it's a chair, but you wouldn't encode any any kind of uncertainty. Oh, it might be like a normal chair, for example, or something. A bit different. So in the posterior estimation, you try to guess what's going on outside, but there's no uncertainty."
"Unknown","00;08;59;20","00;09;28;08","Then predictive processing, you include the uncertainty so mathematically that's called the variance or the or the precision. And then there is no base. It's it's more sophisticated. So you actually encode an arbitrary distribution on the external states. So you could be, oh, it's very likely that it's a non chair and it might also be very likely that it's a cat so that this example doesn't make sense to you."
"Unknown","00;09;28;27","00;09;49;12","You could imagine that there's two things that are very different that could be equally likely. So for example, if you see an illusion, it could be something both two something very different. So you, you'd imagine these two things are having a high probability of being there and then other things are having low probability. This is really the most general thing."
"Unknown","00;09;49;26","00;10;19;13","And also, as is so common, so rational, Bayes, like a lot of machine learning algorithms, you can see them as special cases of rational of these. So I think this is really the most general way to think about inference and this is really at the heart of the 300 year principle. And I think this is why people have been described in the brain as performing very rational based, because it's really the most general way to think about this kind of problem of inference Awesome."
"Unknown","00;10;19;13","00;11;00;22","Well, before I give a comment on that, what made you say that it was at the heart of the free energy principle, right? So the free energy principle says that the brain is doing vibrational basis and then all this work, I mean this paper in particular, but like the last decade, people have been trying to justify why would the free energy principle apply actually and so and so this is part of this paper is part of a line of work where we try to examine physical systems or like adaptive systems and see whether we can describe them as performing version of these great."
"Unknown","00;11;01;00","00;11;35;21","So first, Steven with a question and then anyone else with a question. Thanks. That's really helpful. That explanation. I was wondering is it a case then that you can go only so far with, say, predictive processing? And then to get to Variational Bayes, you and to bring in that uncertainty, you kind of need a free energy principle solution to be able to bring in these more unknown models and to go beyond Variational Bayes at some point, that's when you have to bring in the active of inference to it."
"Unknown","00;11;35;21","00;12;01;07","Would that be a kind of the way you would think about it? Yeah, yeah, I would think about it like this. I would say like loosely speaking, the term predictive processing I think is also meant to refer to rational based, at least rational basis, like a proper mathematical definition of what it is and then predictive processing, it's more like, oh, we're predicting something."
"Unknown","00;12;01;21","00;12;47;20","So it's not that clear how how I mean, there's no clear definition of predictive processing. But in this paper, predictive processing is meant as predictive coding as in like the papers by Rowe and Ballard, where they looked at the visual system and then they looked at neurons in the cortex as forming predictions and suppressing prediction errors. So yeah, if you if you only do predictive processing in this sense, I think you're, you're limited and version of Bayes and active inference is really like the next generation because you can accommodate all sorts of models and, and yeah, I don't, I don't think it I mean I cannot see at least how you would go beyond that"
"Unknown","00;12;49;22","00;13;19;09","thank you. So Dean with a raised hand and then anyone else. Yeah, that's I was curious. So it seems like the math is able to help us understand the difference between something that's really highly defined so that kind of a posterior posteriori and then sort of the fuzzy where the very old variational Bayes part sort of gives us something a little more, little less defined in terms of the edges."
"Unknown","00;13;19;25","00;13;56;11","And so I was just curious, where does the brain kind of go back and forth to to some degree, mathematically speaking, between that which is really clear and really has a hard edge mathematically and and those things which statistically seem to distribute within within the parameters set yeah. I mean, I think all these three like a posterior estimation as well as rational base, there's this plausible explanations for how the brain would implement them."
"Unknown","00;13;56;22","00;14;23;13","OK? And so so the idea the idea for a variation on Bayes or predictive processing is that so the brain would be encoding some kind of uncertainty. And so in the literature, people say that the the mean firing rate of a neural population would include the posterior estimates, which you think is actually out there. And then the variance of the firing rates will encode your uncertainty."
"Unknown","00;14;25;07","00;14;46;07","So I think so I think there's possible plausible theories for how the brain will implement all of these things. And then I think that's the nice thing, at least with active inference, is that we try to develop models that are consistent with our understanding of the brain and that's our understanding of the brain involves we kind of like refine these models."
"Unknown","00;14;47;18","00;15;16;22","So so I think we're definitely working towards models that do explain at least I mean, so far it's very clear and very simplistic, but we're working towards models that could be implemented in the brain so I think like these very, very abstract, very general formal operational based could could be implementing the brain One quick follow up is you mentioned how the mean firing rate corresponds to this."
"Unknown","00;15;17;06","00;15;42;21","First, a posterior already estimation, which is a mean estimation. And then there's the variance in the firing rate. So what measurements or what does it look like to implement Variational Bayes in the brain? Like what measurements are we making what kinds of analysis would we make on those just like mean and variance well, so so the idea I mean, the very simple idea is that you would get some sensory stimulus."
"Unknown","00;15;42;21","00;16;19;24","So you get some some impression on your retina some neurons in your retina would go into the into the visual cortex and then the the premises that your brain has embodied the generative model of its environment. So so it's stable. It has learned how to recognize how to how to infer things in the environment from its sensations. And so the, the stimulus that would be that would go into into V one and, and all these other parts of visual cortex."
"Unknown","00;16;21;11","00;16;52;11","And then the neurons in the visual cortex with the align there means varying rates with respect to, oh, it's an arm chair or it's something different. So maybe there's a neural population that encodes armchair and there's a neural population that includes something else. There's also a lot of studies for specific neurons, like one neuron encoding, one particular stimulus so these there's these guys that they might see that show that there's actually a Bill Clinton neuron that fires whenever you see Bill Clinton."
"Unknown","00;16;52;11","00;17;23;12","So you can be very specific and and you can see but if it's uncertain that it's Bill Clinton, your Bill Clinton neuron would like fire yeah I guess we'd have a lot of variance in its glaringly. OK awesome. So welcome blue with a raised hand go for it and then we'll continue and also Steven so go ahead blue I am Blue Knight and I'm an independent research consultant from New Mexico."
"Unknown","00;17;23;24","00;17;48;26","And I have a question on your paper and it's kind of something that I've been listening a lot lately with regards to the free energy principle and the requirement for this city. And my question is, in your paper, you said that the you know, the outline, even an outline, it says, you know, you partition the world with them or coupling it, and then you equip the partition with stochastic dynamics."
"Unknown","00;17;49;12","00;18;15;01","And so I'm wondering how these experiments relate to the if at all and if that fulfills the requirements, or are we going to see of less than three by a few? Right. Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah. I think I think Steven also also wanted to talk about that. So it's great that you bring this up. So, yeah."
"Unknown","00;18;15;08","00;18;38;08","So so the idea of these stochastic dynamics is that we don't assume that dynamics are deterministic. And it makes sense because you can describe planets as having deterministic dynamics but when you talk about biological systems, things are a lot more messy. And if you're not modeling them at the molecular level, which you which you're never are, things are stochastic."
"Unknown","00;18;39;17","00;19;16;01","So then the big assumption in our system is that it's stationary. And this is really what it means to be adaptive. So you're preserving some kind of steady state, but we never assume ergo. So there's actually a deep suspicion already and earlier this year on the same. So we assume that station already, but we don't assume everybody. And so if they knew you could go to see Appendix B, there's there's a figure, I think, which would be the best way to do the story below yeah."
"Unknown","00;19;16;01","00;19;59;03","Perfect. So here in this appendix, we we illustrate some dynamics that are ergodic and some dynamics that are not ergodic. So if you if you look at the top left and bottom left panels, these dynamics are ergodic. And so the I guess the intuitive definition of this is that here you have the steady state in blue. So so regions that are very blue are regions of high probability mass and then states of regions where you your dynamic is likely to be in and regions are less blue you're less likely to be in."
"Unknown","00;19;59;18","00;20;26;22","Now, this means that if you start your dynamic anywhere and you and you let it run for a sufficient amount of time, so like you observe your biological system for a very long time, you're dynamic with this sample, the whole distribution still would go I mean, if you if you give it enough time, you would go really far away and then it will come back and it will do all sorts of things, as you can see in the bottom left and bottom right."
"Unknown","00;20;28;06","00;20;50;17","So this is regarding now in the in the in the butter, but in the top left hand and bottom left, it's it's ergodic and then the bottom right, it's not ergodic. And so so as you can see, if you start the dynamic on the bottom right, anywhere you will go around the orbit, they won't sample the whole distribution."
"Unknown","00;20;50;17","00;21;19;15","So it's still confined to the small region and, and so this this so the paper is still a place for these kind of dynamics yeah. I don't know. Does that help you? It was not very clear. So to follow up, the paper does apply in situations where it's not. That's what you said. Right? Right. Yeah. We don't need everybody pretty well."
"Unknown","00;21;19;15","00;21;45;09","So even within like a steady state like so biological systems operate within hominids homeostasis, but it's a range, right? So so it's not like a constant it's not like purely we're not at 37 degrees all the time. Like so there's some fluctuation all the time within that steady state. And so I just sort of kind of come back to find those concepts."
"Unknown","00;21;45;16","00;22;15;00","Like is it, is it like a restricting of the state space or how does that work? So so this idea of homeostasis, that's that's really the steady state assumption. So for example, in the states based, maybe you would have 111 coordinate that describes the temperature of your of your biological system. And if it's a human then you would have regions of very high probability."
"Unknown","00;22;15;00","00;22;38;01","So here regions include around 37 degrees and then regions that are less blue like a bit further away. And so the dynamic I mean, your system can evolve in all of these regions, just like on average, you will be more often around 37 degrees just because that's how we are. And then but sometimes it will be higher and sometimes it will be lower."
"Unknown","00;22;38;15","00;23;21;15","And so this is overload and so I guess this ergodic assumption. So then if you assumed that the biological system was regarded, then this would imply that if you if you leave the biological system like run for a sufficiently long time, like you observed for a very long time, it will basically it will sample your whole distribution of temperatures so so maybe so so maybe like the temperature that a human body is allowed to have between like 36 and 39, let's just say, for simplicity."
"Unknown","00;23;22;08","00;23;53;17","And so ergo this city would say, yeah, so if I observe my biological system for a sufficiently long time, I would see my biological system at all these pictures. And I think maybe, maybe that would happen. So maybe or maybe temperature is like we're ergodic with respect to temperature, but maybe there's other things in which we aren't ergodic and I think the previous papers on the fringe principle, they were simplicity."
"Unknown","00;23;53;17","00;24;20;05","They always took like they always assumed some kind of dynamic and it turned out to be ergodic. And so in here, we're not making that assumption. So so I did it. So with one of my questions and I was OK. Yeah. So so, you know, it's great, right? If you're talking about one human system, right? Like mine is the partition it's like internal and external states."
"Unknown","00;24;20;05","00;24;47;25","And so I have my why don't human system or even multiple human systems operate in the same kind of steady state based range? But but if we're talking really about, you know, collections and how it kind of collected dynamics and overlapping markup like it's do you think it's mathematically possible to extend the state space? Like I can operate from 35 to 39, that's an OK temperature for me."
"Unknown","00;24;48;06","00;25;21;15","But like a reptile has a very different kind of temperature range. But clearly, like we have some interaction, I have interaction with the reptile and so there's some, some emergency dynamic between me and some reptile creature. Right, right. And so can we define a state space? Would it be mathematically like acceptable or is it like defensively, mathematically impossible to define a state space where I'm allowed to sample all the temperature ranges with my like if some other feature and some kind of collective data, it's not like they have a different like is that still in the city?"
"Unknown","00;25;21;18","00;25;47;26","Because it's not clearly I'm not simply the entire state space. I'm simply the United States but like is that confounding in some way? I mean, it is in my bringing the plan. Yeah, that's a really good question. So so this is all thanks to we can do everything you just said. And so when we actually when when we say we so we we always sample a distribution."
"Unknown","00;25;48;19","00;26;08;29","We're not I mean, and then the distribution is on the same space. So we're something that state space. But like if you're a distribution is confined to a region of state space. So let's say as a human I cannot possibly have any bodily temperatures below 36 degrees. Then you're then you would sample only things that are above 36 degrees."
"Unknown","00;26;09;25","00;26;39;18","So I think you would have your own steady state your own stationary distribution with temperatures that are 37 degrees and then if there's a there's a snake also in the in this environment that you're modeling then we'll have another very different steady state and so I think it really your question really speaks to the possible extensions of these of this work because in this paper we just say oh there's like an internal states base which would be what's inside."
"Unknown","00;26;40;05","00;27;03;18","And then there's an external states boots which would be what's outside the then really what would people we need to do now is to say, oh, but my actually there's a lot of very interesting things in my environment. There may be snakes, there may be other kinds of animals. And they all have their own Markov blanket and they all have their own steady state."
"Unknown","00;27;04;01","00;27;27;13","So then what you can do is to partition your external space based into all of these things that might be around you. And then instead of having some kind of performing some kind of simple inference as we have in this paper, you would have some more structure inference and more structured inference because part of your inference would be about what's just in front of you."
"Unknown","00;27;27;13","00;27;49;08","Part of your inference would be about your dog that's right over there. And you would have a lot of bicarb in your external spacing to different things with their own steady state. You would actually have an inference that's much more structured because you would infer all these things all these different things that are in your environment. So this can be accommodated in this paper."
"Unknown","00;27;50;08","00;28;15;20","They would definitely need another paper to make that explicit. And I'd say some really interesting things because, yeah, this is really the way to go, but the mathematics doesn't need doesn't need extension. It's just like, yeah, it would just be like partition this space. And then we can have all that that you spoke about. That's thank you. Great."
"Unknown","00;28;15;28","00;28;48;01","And also one piece of Steven's question is it's not as if something being ergodic or not is equivalent to it being easy or simple or tractable, like looking at these distributions or trajectories here, the one that you characterized as non-organic, not sampling, basically across the state space, the bottom right. This one is the one that in their caption, it says purely conservative dynamics, lower right panel or reminiscent of the trajectories of massive bodies whose random fluctuations are negligible."
"Unknown","00;28;48;18","00;29;12;27","So it's actually not like it's maybe this will speak to Stephen's questions about what is a thorn and what's a rose because this is a non ergodic system that's massively predictable. You can do it with a, you know, a gear. So maybe that relates to some of these criticisms about, well, we're only working with a limited set of ergodic processes."
"Unknown","00;29;12;27","00;29;32;11","It's like, OK, but that's the squiggly one that's dancing everywhere, the stochastic process that we care about, whereas including non ergodic processes, some of these non ergodic processes might just be going around in an oval. So it won't be a challenge for the math at all. Something that works on the stochastic squiggle is going to have actually an easier time on this oval one."
"Unknown","00;29;32;20","00;30;09;01","So Stephen and then anyone else with the question. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I suppose actually tying into what you just said, the Daniel that this, this, this question with how much we need to be able to sample over big state spaces. So it might well be the, I don't know, the chemicals of a cell, the VAT with molecules vibrating millions of times a second and then maybe a, you know, a quick ongoing way to sort of get a feel for the Ergodic state space."
"Unknown","00;30;09;15","00;30;37;13","Now if you watch a cricket ball come towards you you know, you don't get that chance to do that. So but you might want to sort of maintain this some sort of trajectory that can still be tractable, I suppose. So I think this is this is actually quite, quite useful. I suppose the question then comes in is how what's the sort of in-betweens?"
"Unknown","00;30;37;13","00;31;08;05","You know, where does approximation science come in more and more to allow us to sort of work with not knowing and work with something like these solenoid or flows in a, in a more fuzzy way. Because I'm assuming that if you've got less chances to sample your state space solenoid or might be more useful to get towards something tractable."
"Unknown","00;31;08;05","00;31;35;23","Or maybe I'm wrong, but I wonder what your thoughts are on that right and so actually solenoid or I I mean, so in this figure here on the bottom left, you have like no solenoid or float and then the bottom right, there's just solenoid. So we'd see all of these two like very special cases. They don't look like biological systems at all."
"Unknown","00;31;36;24","00;32;03;09","And they're also the simplest ones to to understand mathematically and to study mathematically. And actually when it gets really interesting and when it looks a lot more like a biological system is on the top left and that's harder to just as mathematically. And so as you can see, it's what I mean. I think the dynamic on the top left is quite nice because on the one hand, you have this situation, you had some squiggly lines."
"Unknown","00;32;03;09","00;32;30;12","You have randomness on the other hand, things to be so, you know, you have some kind of exploration and also some kind of like circular patterns. So, for example, in and this is actually how you correct there is what's called a non equilibrium steady state without without going into the details as humans and as animals, we have a lot of circular questions that are not purely deterministic."
"Unknown","00;32;30;12","00;32;55;07","So for example, we'll have a circadian rhythm and we have all sorts of other sort of factors. And I think you have to account for that. You really need to be to be on the top left so I think the I mean, one of the next steps to this research is right. Right now, we just assumed that the dynamic is stationary."
"Unknown","00;32;55;07","00;33;26;12","And so this applies to like a humongous range of dynamics and a lot of them don't look like biological systems at all. And I think the next step would be to to restrict ourselves to dynamics that look a lot more like that, like biological systems. And then see what else can we see. And and I bet there's some dynamics that look a lot like very intelligent systems and some that also look like maybe lifelike systems that are not so intelligent."
"Unknown","00;33;26;27","00;33;55;08","Then the question is what kind of parameters, what kind of dynamics do you need to characterize something that explores its environment, something that makes decisions of all sorts of things yeah. And and that's going to be a challenge. And also, I mean, just speaking about biological systems, I think biological systems have a lot of sudden flu, and they do have this ambition, but they don't have so much distribution."
"Unknown","00;33;55;26","00;34;16;27","So you would have something like the top left, but like huge. Yeah, huge. Like a lot of exploration. And you would go a lot further than that in your states, and then you would have a bit of I mean, you would have a lot of squiggly lines, but it would be yeah, there would be a lot more like exploration than there is this division."
"Unknown","00;34;18;02","00;35;05;23","Yes. To even go forward yeah. And you have both can combine so gradient descent and sudden audio flow, you can kind of be playing at the same time. I'm wondering if someone was to bring attention to a goal or a type of attention, maybe a more pragmatic attention or an epistemic attention or a risk averse attention weather. Yeah, it might be that rather than trying to deal with the whole state space, maybe that that general process carries on but if it tries to introduce a solenoid or, you know, type of flow, which in some ways you could imagine being more tractable to a biological system, if it's like by electricity, as you know, the types"
"Unknown","00;35;05;23","00;35;50;14","of dynamics which may be more tractable around a certain trajectory than some. So you see these these dynamics could combine in different regimes of attention. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And I think but I think to to properly account for attention, we need to go beyond these continuous databases and do what people and basically extend to these standard models of active inference where in addition to some continuous state speech, maybe like for movements and this kind of thing, you also have a discrete state space and then you will have a dynamic evolving in your state space."
"Unknown","00;35;50;14","00;36;12;21","And maybe like some states would be bending over there and some other state would be sending over there. So I think attention is really something that can be modeled with a discrete state space. And then it would I don't think it would be so hard and I mean, it seems doable to extend all the math here to like models."
"Unknown","00;36;14;04","00;36;32;23","Yeah. That have some neat continuous state space for movement or, or, or, or other kinds of things like maybe like blood glucose concentration is also something that evolves on a continuous scale. There's also a lot of a lot of things in our mind that are discrete. So is this red, yes or no? Is it raining, yes or no?"
"Unknown","00;36;33;24","00;37;06;08","And to account for all that we need, we need this space as well. Awesome. Thank you, Lance. Welcome, Scott. I see you're Andrei, so go for the question and then anyone else for the race tent. Thank you. I came in a little late. My apologies. It's fascinating. The zone oil flow, and that could set up. Is it possible that he had multiple state spaces and might because of the solenoid or flow, might it have a periodicity in each of the state spaces?"
"Unknown","00;37;06;16","00;37;26;13","So that you might be able to use four transforms to unpack multiple state spaces in a biological system? So could you use do you know, so having that periodicity, does that allow for a four year type analysis to start to unpack state spaces? Potentially, when you have multiple state spaces and you're trying to distinguish them, that's a that's a really good point."
"Unknown","00;37;26;13","00;38;06;25","So I know another paper actually that analyzes the flow in terms of the free transform I haven't really, really thought about it. I think I mean, if it if you could get rid of the disruptive parts, if you get rid of the squiggly lines and you're just in the bottom right, then you can use for transports. But then also the dynamic on the bottom right is not is not representative of biological systems so then what you can do when you're on the left, which is really the interesting case, is analyze the time irreversible parts of this flow with the transport."
"Unknown","00;38;08;06","00;38;42;06","And then so so you do this simple decomposition that we're talking about in the appendix, you decompose your dynamic into. Yes, it's the equation eight to yeah. Yeah. Perfect. So you decompose your your drift needs to be is the direction in which your dynamics is moving on average, into reversible and irreversible parts. The irreversible part is sort so which you can analyze using Fourier transform, but then you need to figure out how to accommodate the reversible part with it."
"Unknown","00;38;43;18","00;39;11;17","So so I can share I can share the paper if you're interested but yeah, it seems like they're able to, to do some things with that technique, but it's also pretty, pretty involved to be honest. So a question on the time reversible and irreversible, what does that mean? And in a world where it seems like we're moving forward through time, only, what exactly does that mean?"
"Unknown","00;39;11;17","00;39;36;08","That there's something that's invariant under time reversible versus something that changes sign under time reversal, like if we can't get at the time machine or put the process in a time machine, why does it matter that it's time reversible or how does that fall out of the equations? Right. Well, yeah, so so all this is really to emphasize that we're not assuming the dynamic to be reversible."
"Unknown","00;39;37;08","00;39;58;27","And as you say everything in the world around us, I mean, most things are irreversible. So the if you go back to to figure this below so the movement of planets is really something that's irreversible. I mean, the the Earth turns around the sun in one direction. And if you are to rewind time, it will turn around the sun in the other direction."
"Unknown","00;39;58;27","00;40;23;13","So that so in this case you can read. So the difference between time as time goes forward and this time goes backwards. And that's really what's meant by time irreversible. But now if you look like a cup of coffee and the coffee is still the molecules, the coffee molecules or whatever molecules you have in that cup, there's still bouncing with each other."
"Unknown","00;40;24;16","00;40;51;12","And that's that's something that's reversible because if you look at the cup of coffee, if you if I give you a movie of the cup of coffee sitting still, you can watch the movie as time goes forward or backward and and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So something that's reversible. And so as you can see from this example, actually things that are reversible aren't interesting at all from at least a biological perspective."
"Unknown","00;40;52;00","00;41;22;16","And there's there's so much literature about yeah. But one of the things I mean, one of the fundamental things of being alive is being time irreversible. It's about like eating and producing waste. It's about consuming energy, all that kind of thing. All that kind of stuff produces entropy and it's time irreversible. But then so it's a timing irreversibility."
"Unknown","00;41;22;16","00;41;52;13","It's something that's necessary to be alive, but it's not, it's not sufficient. So for example, if I give you a conviction, so that would be time irreversible, they won't even be alive. So any, any kind of cycle that's more or less periodic. So maybe you see if you see like a cyclone, a cyclone this time irreversible because it's like spinning one way and the other is if you run out of time, it would be spinning the other way."
"Unknown","00;41;53;11","00;42;22;01","So it's different. So it's irreversible, but that's not a life and so there's many, many things like that. Time, irreversibility. Yeah. Creation of entropy. There's a few things like that that characterize biological systems. And I think as we as we go on with this work, we'll, we'll try to like specialize to only those dynamics that satisfy all these requirements."
"Unknown","00;42;22;05","00;42;58;21","And eventually things like, oh, we need systems are able to reproduce, for example, like a Markov blanket that is able to divide into two Markov blankets, for example, when, when the cell decomposes into into two cells. So so this is really the beginning and an idea in the next two years, I think this community is really going to be able to address all of these challenges and they will all these characterizations of living systems to gradually evolve towards models that are more realistic, I would say."
"Unknown","00;42;59;15","00;43;25;14","Awesome. So I'll have more to say on it. But Scott, go for it. So a couple of things. There's a book called Life Ratchet, which is kind of interesting just on that, the idea of that irreversibility and that value of that. The idea is that life kind of ratchets in these forms that work with the externality. I haven't revisited that since I've been exposed to active inference, but it might be interesting to take another look at life's ratchet."
"Unknown","00;43;25;27","00;43;50;02","Also, one of the things I like that discussion of living forms and what's necessary prerequisites to living forms. One of the working definitions I'll share that I'm using now and I think let me tell you why I'm using it, is that life is auto catalytic and entropy secreting. You know, my kids claim the I just wanted to say secretion in my definition because it's Gucci."
"Unknown","00;43;50;02","00;44;15;01","That was one my kids used to say, but auto catalytic and entropy secreting. So notice I didn't say it had to be embodied in a specific form or specific matrix or context could be a mark, it could be a mark of, you know, a lot of different things. So so the reason I share that here, it's interesting because active inference, we have this definition of life like Carolus Linnaeus, you look at it and you see if it has feathers and you see if it has blood and stuff like that."
"Unknown","00;44;15;11","00;44;52;02","But now we're going towards mathematical definitions of living things. And that's going to be very interesting because I think when we have a working definition that works for biologic forms. So again, my working definition right now is auto catalytic and entropy secreting. Then I can start to say, OK, if that works for biologic forms, let's say that did work and maybe there's problems with that, but if it works, then you could start to say, OK, what other systems happen to be auto catalytic and entropy secreting and therefore we now call living and maybe we can start to look at them and make observations about those systems."
"Unknown","00;44;52;06","00;45;27;25","And what I'm thinking about, I'm a guy who's a lawyer and in finance for years, so I'm looking at this and saying, OK, you look at these systems, biological systems came up with these markets and these other systems that we have to do things in the world. Maybe these systems are describable with biological framings. And so that's why the kind of work you're doing feels like as it starts to reveal some more general definitions of living forms, taking those definitions and then reapplying them back out into the world and saying, OK, are there living forms that have escaped our detection as living forms?"
"Unknown","00;45;28;06","00;45;51;11","And basically, are they is this scale independence of the fractal elements? What are the things that we can now describe in those things that we previously had not thought of as biology, but in fact are describable as biology? That's very exciting to me. So I just wanted to say that the kind of things you were describing there and that kind of work working way back down into a model of life based on time irreversibility is very interesting, I think."
"Unknown","00;45;51;23","00;46;21;29","Thanks very interesting paper overall. I'm looking forward to diving into this and the other that other paper you were mentioning also. Thank you. Cool. Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. That's really great. So to tie this from the some of the physical examples we've been talking about, like the diffusion processes to the physics of information and information flows, the big thing we've been talking about is this statistical physics in this Bayesian mechanics."
"Unknown","00;46;22;16","00;47;09;09","And we heard a little bit earlier how we could talk about the moments like the first moment, the simplest form, the posteriori estimation was the mean and then the second moment of a statistical distribution is the variance. And there's also higher statistical moments that describe higher and higher aspects of an informational distribution and there's also the concept in physics of moments like the position and the velocity and higher and higher physical moments and so the mapping is that potentially these physical moments that would describe components of a physical flow that could also be decomposed using the Helmholtz decomposition might also apply to some of these informational flows and decompositions."
"Unknown","00;47;09;20","00;47;55;06","So we could use those analogies like the coffee mixing and the steady state of the coffee, and then think about how a statistical distribution is playing by similar rules. And so it's also interesting, Scott, about instead of going from the non-living systems and then looking for that pattern and pattern matching to biological systems, we can kind of start up on the top left with or something even more biologically fleshed out and then look for those patterns and pattern match outside of systems that have, you know, a vertebra and a central nervous system because that shouldn't be the the card to get into the club of information processing systems or entropy secreting systems."
"Unknown","00;47;55;19","00;48;30;27","So any thoughts on this yeah. I mean, yeah, the thing I think that's, that's really interesting I mean, the the real challenge here is to is to make the link between the physics and the information and the more I've been working on this, the more I realize that actually a lot of a lot of physics or at least a lot of statistical physics, you can you can explain with properties of, of information."
"Unknown","00;48;31;13","00;49;16;27","So for example, entropy increasing is also information being lost not not stochastic, stochastic. It is. So the inability to predict the future. Exactly. And is exactly the same as entropy being lost every time, information being lost over time and entropy, entropy increasing so I think there's there's very deep connections between them. Yeah. Information physics, inference and so some of them have been fleshed out, but not I mean, it hasn't it hasn't really been put together, at least as far as I know."
"Unknown","00;49;16;27","00;49;48;22","In this context, in the context of Markov, like it's in the context of how, how can we have a theory of adaptive systems where you can and can we describe adaptive systems as performing inference. So instead I think this this is really exciting. And also, as you can see from this paper, so the dynamics that we're considering there, they're extremely general and for these dynamics, for all of them, we're able to derive some kind of inference."
"Unknown","00;49;49;07","00;50;15;02","So this is to say that this inferential description is it applies to many systems. And so it means that on the one hand it's very ubiquitous. But then on the other hand, it's not it's not that useful because maybe like the things that didn't look at all like download ecosystems can still can still satisfy this kind of energy principle or Bayesian mechanics."
"Unknown","00;50;15;23","00;50;42;12","So so I think what's really exciting is to to be able to in the future to, to like specialized to those dynamics that look more like biological systems and then relook at these informational properties. And I think a big one is how much exploration do we have? An exploration is really something exploration and curiosity. It's really something that characterizes intelligent systems as we know it."
"Unknown","00;50;43;29","00;51;22;23","And so there's some discussions in the literature of how we would be able to use things like information length and concepts for information theory and information geometry to quantify things like memory and its intrinsic curiosity. And so so one question from the live chat where we continue the question is what is the explicit definition of information flow? And also maybe in that if you want to describe a little bit about this other paper, like what is information flow, what is information geometry and how does it relate to what we're talking about here?"
"Unknown","00;51;23;18","00;52;05;05","Right. So so this this is of the idea of as an organism, you're always encoding some beliefs about your environment. So we talked about maximum of this theory and variation of inference so the idea is that we're always receiving sensations and then making some inferences about the outside. Now, if you're making something this is about the I would say implicitly or mathematically your parameter using a distribution of both things in the in the environment and so information geometry then comes into play."
"Unknown","00;52;05;26","00;52;11;28","Information geometry quantifies the extent to which beliefs about the environment are different from each other."
"Unknown","00;52;14;03","00;52;43;18","So it doesn't it doesn't make sense to for example, let's say that let's say that I think Daniel's yeah, Daniel's eyes are blue let's let's just see. And then I have some uncertainty around the real color. So that would be like one, one kind of the least. I could have both. And then another type of belief would be Daniel."
"Unknown","00;52;43;18","00;53;14;13","Those are are Brown. And then I would have some other kind of uncertainty. Now, the way now a question you could ask me is how different are these two beliefs and if I have if I had a different beliefs about the color of those, would that belief be more different than the beliefs I initially had? So then information geometry enables you to answer these questions."
"Unknown","00;53;14;13","00;53;37;26","It enables you to see how beliefs are different from each other. Like once it's saying the distance between them. But also even more interestingly, as I let's say, I've never met Daniel before. Let's say I haven't seen this picture before. Now you give me a picture of Daniel, I'm going to make an inference about the color of his eyes."
"Unknown","00;53;37;26","00;54;15;16","So from being initially completely agnostic, I'm going to move my completely agnostic belief to a belief that says, oh, maybe is brown nice so this is to say that as we make inferences and sample the world, it will. And so information geometry enables you to see and enables you to quantify how much your beliefs evolved, evolved, and what kind of trajectory did they take because I mean, I'm assuming that these are beneath the they will be in a continuous manner as we sample more information."
"Unknown","00;54;16;03","00;54;51;14","And then it becomes interesting to see what kind of trajectories it might be used to and was that was the trajectory of vision. If it wasn't the vision, maybe I lost some energy there that I could have used somewhere else. So so my my friend wasn't very optimal from that perspective. And then so there's a paper about this actually on active inference that uses information geometry to just see how, how whether inferences, inactive inference are inefficient from the metabolic point of view."
"Unknown","00;54;51;29","00;55;21;19","So something that you can look at with information geometry Thanks. Just to follow up from the chart and then we'll return to our colleagues here. Do we have or more precisely, do we hope to have a definition like an electoral magnetic flux in field theory for information flows, information flux yes. Yes. So so information flux is the the movement of beliefs."
"Unknown","00;55;22;08","00;55;59;12","And so you can you can write that down mathematically so so yeah, I mean, a belief is a probability distribution about things that are going on in the environment. And as you sample information, you would change probability distribution. So it would be like a motion on the space of probability distributions that's read the meaning of information. So then maybe the question was about can we derive some kind of like Maxwell's equation, some kind of law about how about how information flow happens like maybe an equation for information flow."
"Unknown","00;56;00;05","00;56;21;15","And then we'd say that that's what we that that would be the aim. There would be what, what people are working towards in theoretical neuroscience like some kind of equation, these things that would make inference. Awesome. So if you raised hands Scott first, then blue, then Steven so go ahead, Scott. A couple of things that was fascinating. Little bits there."
"Unknown","00;56;22;08","00;56;43;15","So on that last piece on the information flows, two points. The embodiment I'm thinking of embodiment of information. So I'm thinking of a farmer that's deciding what crops to plant. So they look and they get information from the newspaper and they look at weather reports and they gather information. Then they decided what seeds to plant. The seed itself is an embodiment of information."
"Unknown","00;56;43;20","00;57;02;03","They put the seed in the ground, they get results with their farming the markets then respond. So there is their seeds as information farmers, processing information markets, processing information. And one of the things that's kind of interesting here is a lot of the work I'm doing now is in food chains and trying to figure out how to de-risk food chains and just food generally."
"Unknown","00;57;02;14","00;57;27;07","And that efficiency question you just asked is really interesting. What are the losses and conversions that happen when information is embodied in those different aspects of that decision process through which something gets converted from a need of society to have a certain amount of corn at a certain time of year to through all those chains of seeds and selections and farmers processing."
"Unknown","00;57;27;14","00;57;50;13","So it's kind of interesting to look at this system as both each piece of it is living. The seed is arguably living, although there's a question of whether the seeds are living among people who are biologists and then because they're not actively doing so, but the kind of status. But anyway, that embodiment question is that's one. And let me ask both the turn of my voice here."
"Unknown","00;57;50;25","00;58;09;21","So the embodiment question is one kind of that notion you just talked about, about an overall formula. Maybe there's an overall embodiment characterization that's made possible using those landscapes and looking at a kind of a multifaceted landscape and looking at those conversions that happen from one embodiment of information to another and efficiency efficiencies there. That's an interesting kind of possible thought."
"Unknown","00;58;09;26","00;58;28;19","The other one is you said something about curiosity before maximum exploration and maximum of curiosity. That really struck me because one of the things we've been advocating for, I did a lot of cyber work a number of years ago, and people were coming out of the military and we were saying, oh, hey, you military guys got to learn more critical thinking."
"Unknown","00;58;28;28","00;59;02;20","That was kind of insulting. They were senior people right there like we. But really they didn't. And one of the things they started saying is don't tell people they have to get critical thinking that they have to be curious. And it's kind of interesting they were getting now to this system of your maximum exploration possibility, maximum efficiency in some ways with curiosity to me that really inform a lot of teaching because if you have people who develop a curiosity over their lifetime, they take care of being educated continuously, are learning."
"Unknown","00;59;03;05","00;59;31;09","And so that notion of exploration, curiosity seems like it could fundamentally, through active inference, affect how we do teaching and much less of rote teaching and much more of a curiosity based teaching because of the power, you'll never know what you're going to encounter out there in the world. And so telling your children hey, be curious will intrinsically serve them versus teaching them a rote series of things to respond to their environment."
"Unknown","00;59;31;18","00;59;54;00","So just a couple of comments on this last two things I thought were fascinating. You yeah, that's really interesting. So as you as you said, and I think we all agree an information or maybe 70, 70 years ago or eight years ago, we didn't have any kind of information theory. Information theory wasn't a thing. Computers weren't the thing."
"Unknown","00;59;54;00","01;00;19;10","And we didn't really think about information even though it was there in books and everywhere around it. And I think with the advent of computers and information theory, just information became a big thing and people realized it was important. And now everyone thinks about everything in terms of information. And I think that's the right way to look at things."
"Unknown","01;00;19;10","01;00;53;04","And it seems to be, yeah, information can encode just about anything by definition. And so physics or at least our descriptions of the world, they're the matter was the most important thing, mother, and the ways this is how it all started. And then and then information geometry and information theory came into play and people started looking at these things in terms of information as well."
"Unknown","01;00;53;26","01;01;26;21","But I think that matter remained a big thing. Then more and more people are looking at an information center like the the most important concept, at least the root concept from which from which you can like encode or explain everything else and so, so yeah, information geometry came around and enables you to see how information is flowing over time and how that relates to heat and things like that."
"Unknown","01;01;27;20","01;02;04;28","And now people are looking at how information may be encoded by things about other things. And this is really Bayesian mechanics, Bayesian mechanics, the, the root of the word is beliefs. About things that are held, that are held by other things. And I think this is yeah, I mean Bayesian mechanics, I guess started out, I mean in a way it started out long ago with like Bayesian inference, but Bayesian inference started out as a as an abstract statistical concept."
"Unknown","01;02;04;28","01;02;33;14","And now people are trying to relate that to physics and and yeah, so so I think we're moving towards a physics that's information based and, and based about. Yeah, based about beliefs about things and about other things. So this is really Bayesian mechanics information geometry and then what you said about curiosity was also really interesting. And so so yeah, definitely."
"Unknown","01;02;33;14","01;03;02;28","I mean, people are tuning to us. So yeah, they're trying to optimize curiosity of agents with respect to different environments in, in a paper that we have called Active Inference on these big stakes basis of synthesis, we in, in one of the appendices, we, we justify the expected reality objective that people use for decision making in biological agents."
"Unknown","01;03;03;16","01;03;38;21","And we actually showed that we could have so the expected strategy for for those who don't know is this the ways exploration and exploitation exploration is really the curiosity as we had these two terms. And in general, I mean, these two terms are put on the same footing. But actually in the in the appendix of that active inference is synthesis paper we show that you could weigh them in a different way and then you would then I mean, the."
"Unknown","01;03;39;21","01;03;59;12","Yeah, the agent would still work somehow will have a different behavior. So you can be a lot more curious or a lot less curious and that would be really interesting to quantify in terms of like concepts of information you only see. But so so this is to say that you can actually tune that and have agents that have different curiosities."
"Unknown","01;04;00;05","01;04;30;10","And also make me think about what you said about things from computational psychiatry where people explain diseases like computational diseases as as people having like different priors in their genes model and seeing how those how that would affect behavior. So you can explain like suboptimal, optimal and suboptimal behavior with like the same principles just by changing the model."
"Unknown","01;04;30;28","01;05;04;07","And we also have a recent paper on the Bayesian brains and the Rainey divergence, where we're basically showing that by changing doing ratio inference a bit differently, you can actually account for agents that are optimal that make the right decisions and the agents that maybe a bit suboptimal in terms of curiosity and so on. So I think there's like a lot of exciting computational work to be done in terms of characterizing different behaviors."
"Unknown","01;05;05;04","01;05;29;19","And I think we're really at the beginning and the ultimate deal these things will be able to I mean, people will be able to account with the information. I think that's the right framework. Thank you. This is quick follow up, Scott. Go for it. Yeah, well, two things. One, the Beijing mechanics, when you say beliefs about things that are held by other things, that feels nice to the example of the farmer in the seeds because it's an embodiment."
"Unknown","01;05;29;19","01;05;59;15","Each thing that embodies something is the embodiment is a belief in a sense, right? Because it's holding a seed doesn't have a belief itself, but it's embodying information. And so it's interesting to think about belief of things. And then the embodiment of information in the thing, intrinsic affordance that the thing offers, right? That is that what's the relationship between belief and intrinsic physical affordance that's in a system that is a result of an earlier information system."
"Unknown","01;05;59;21","01;06;14;24","That's one follow up. Then the second follow up is the way I soften people up. When you talk to older people and you like, Oh, it's all information, it's not physical, we're information beings. The way I soften them up just to share is I say to them, Do you have a 41 K retirement plan? You most older people starting to think about that."
"Unknown","01;06;15;03","01;06;34;23","And then they say, Yeah. And I say, Do you think it's a pile of groceries waiting for you to do retire? Because it's not. It's just data in a system. And if that system goes away, you got nothing. So it's that idea of getting people to understand how much we depend upon information. And then people start thinking, Oh, wow, I guess I really do depend upon all sorts of other systems in my life."
"Unknown","01;06;34;23","01;06;54;11","It's something that as physical beings, it's hard for us to realize how much we are information beings. And that's again, just part of that rhetorical exercise to get people in the headspace of saying, Wow, maybe things really aren't information that I thought were solid like my retirement plans, but really they're just totally dependent on the systems and the information out to the system."
"Unknown","01;06;54;13","01;07;22;01","Thank you, Scott. Thank you so blue with a question. Go for it. So you mentioned a paper that you will, I don't know for this year. But about information, geometry and defense is this one that's markup like it's information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics. Is that what you're talking about? And know that that's on this one. So if you're if you're referring to the one."
"Unknown","01;07;23;09","01;08;03;22","Yeah. About how inferences decisions like quantifying efficiency of inference and how much energy you need to do a kind of inference. It's not this paper it's another paper called the Neural Dynamics under Active Inference, something that I have some questions and I don't know anything about information geometry. I mean, just a little tiny bit. So so it's something that I've definitely studied to get very interested in because I think that it's going to be maybe like the next level of where after the science goes."
"Unknown","01;08;03;22","01;08;26;17","Maybe, maybe. I mean, I just have this suspicion. So when when you have information and in an information geometry, like in an information flow I've been reading other papers about information flow in channels, right? So like when you and I mean, it makes sense because when you have when you know something about the state, I mean, it's just like Bayesian."
"Unknown","01;08;26;25","01;08;56;26","It's like your belief about the next state of the world is based on the state of the world right now. OK, so so I mean, it doesn't make sense that you would think, you know, all of the sudden I'm going to be like on Pluto based on my kind of information. And so does is information geometry, do the channels appear when you look at it and information geometry, does it appear to be like a trajectory that's good?"
"Unknown","01;08;56;28","01;09;22;09","That's a good question. So I think I think information geometries is more general that you don't need to have a channel. It's really about at the heart of it. It's really about having different probability distributions. And these are actually beliefs about stuff and looking how they differ from each other and like movement, how how repeated distributions change over time."
"Unknown","01;09;22;09","01;09;55;22","This kind of problems. But then so so you're right to say that information theory started out with the study of channels communication channels between different different things and you have a. Yeah, there's a lot of work on information theory and channels and still today with in engineering. So I would I would guess there's a lot of work also on information geometry with channels but that would be like a subset of the whole field of information geometry."
"Unknown","01;09;56;08","01;10;24;25","And I would say it would be yeah. I would say that people contributing to the literature would be mostly from the from engineering or engineering Thanks blue. Anything there. Ya go for it. Yeah, I just felt really quick. So the, so I know like about the spatial theory and like the flow information and the channels say like a telephone line or whatever, like some direct method of communication."
"Unknown","01;10;25;05","01;10;41;24","But like the way I don't know, I don't know if I'm thinking about it in the wrong way because when I try to search for like information flow in the channel and maybe it's the same, but I think about it in a different way, like I think about a channel flowing from like the present to into the future, right?"
"Unknown","01;10;42;06","01;11;07;00","So like there's only so many like next states that are possible right? Like based on my present state. And so is it incorrect or is incorrect to think about like not a direct channel as in I'm speaking to you over the Internet Information Channel, but like the channel from now into some future state is not the same kind of like mathematical engineering information channel right?"
"Unknown","01;11;07;27","01;11;30;01","Yeah, that yeah, you're catching me off guard because I don't, I don't know about channels. So I mean, what you say sounds down. Spasibo. And I would say yes, though I wouldn't be able to say for sure just because I don't know that literature thanks. Well, I'm sure it come back to this in the weeks and years to come."
"Unknown","01;11;30;13","01;11;32;09","So Stephen, go for it."
"Unknown","01;11;34;23","01;12;08;15","Yeah, I'm, I'm really interested by the these different time these bits together. You know why I suppose that sort of come up. We've got this sort of information geometry that I suppose can come from an ergodic space or a kind of a state space. And then you've got solenoid all flows within maybe an ISO control of that or potentially I suppose it doesn't have to be solenoid or it could be like an ISO control flow if it was more complex."
"Unknown","01;12;08;15","01;12;44;13","I mean, and when you've got that potential to go and have a solenoid type flow to sample, would that be more a slightly more of a second order sampling approach that something might you so you've got, you know, the distribution could just emerge from a steady space, steady state, sort of a could this city process and you would maybe somehow systematize a flow or a way of engaging that information."
"Unknown","01;12;44;23","01;13;18;17","And I could I could imagine that would then make sense of some of the entropy, entropy consuming potential of a living system, which is that it can kind of go upgrading descent and the solenoid or flow then gives Scott's sort of entropy secreting option. It seems a bit more viable then because maybe I could choose most full solenoids or samplings of information, geometries and secrete the ones which aren't as good, if that makes sense."
"Unknown","01;13;18;28","01;13;48;07","So, so I be curious in terms of how you know that the ability to go to more second order understandings within a system and within the dynamics might be offered by the solenoid or sampling may be even taken into account. Things like the, the landscape used on the, the mounting car problem, you know, that landscape, you can't sample the whole landscape."
"Unknown","01;13;48;14","01;14;24;26","Got it. CLI could you have lots of solenoid or samplers or something like that around the landscape. Yeah. Yeah, it's a really good point. So there's deep connections between scenario flow and information geometry and mostly in the context of the, as you pointed out, the sampling literature. So in so the, the idea is that if you sort of stochastic process somewhere and you certainly don't flow, it will converge to its steady state a lot faster than if it didn't have solenoid."
"Unknown","01;14;25;28","01;14;35;02","So then you can quantify that in terms of information geometry, maybe taking a shorter path to the steady state and things like that."
"Unknown","01;14;38;00","01;15;30;19","So then there's also a really nice new paper actually called, um, is there, is there an analog of MR of acceleration in for instance? And so that paper shows that. Yeah, that paper really does a nice job of illustrating some, some deep connections between stochastic processes and information geometry. And so the idea is that if you start with a very simple called a very simple process called over logical dynamics then you can show that actually the dynamic in the information space is doing so like the process is doing a gradient descent on on divergence to reach to reach the steady state."
"Unknown","01;15;30;20","01;15;57;11","So the target distribution so this is just this process is exactly doing like standard in standard variation or inference. But then if you add some solenoid or slow you actually make that convergence happen faster. So it's like an accelerated method and so and so in terms of biology, you can see that if you have an overflow, your inference happens faster."
"Unknown","01;15;57;11","01;16;45;27","So you like you're able to insert things a lot faster. So you like in a sense, more intelligent. I think we talk about it in one of the figures in the part of the paper and so and so in that paper that I just mentioned, they show that with a particular stochastic process actually implement some kind of accelerated variation or inference so yeah, there's some literature about that and it would be interesting to see those processes that form inference very fast, whether when we put them in the Bayesian mechanics of this, whether we can say, oh, these actually can be seemed to correspond to two biological systems that we've been studying, things like that."
"Unknown","01;16;46;29","01;17;08;16","Can I just ask one quick question on that? When you say adding solenoid or flow, is that adding it in the sampling methodology or is it somehow maybe I suppose it's a could it be sort of physically or is that how does that work? Yeah, definitely. So then the stone, a node of flow, is this time irreversible part."
"Unknown","01;17;09;25","01;17;32;28","So so intuitively it's this kind of like steering or mixing the system. So maybe she have a very nice example actually is if you have a cup of coffee and you pour milk in it. Now what you could do is just wait by the milk and the coffee to mix together and this would be no, certainly no, no, no."
"Unknown","01;17;32;29","01;17;52;12","Because you're not mixing anything like is just happening on its own and you have a dynamic like in the in the figure that we saw before like on the bottom left so it would become reversible and this would actually converge to the steady state pretty slowly. So in terms of information geometry, you would have a slow dynamic to the steady state."
"Unknown","01;17;52;28","01;18;21;24","In terms of statistics, you would have a slow variation. That's because you reach your target distribution very slowly. Now, what you can do is adding insulin flow. So this would be I take my spoon and I'm going to do the coffee and the milk together. Then we all know then that this is going to allow the system to mix and to and to actually become uniformly mixed a lot faster so."
"Unknown","01;18;21;24","01;18;54;29","So mathematically it means that we reach the target distribution of this steady state, faster sources of information, geometry. We're also faster in terms of statistics. You can interpret that as doing variation or inference faster. Now, this interesting thing about adding in the node of slow is that in physics, it's called breaking detail balance and breaking detail balance is about you actually probably only need to two inputs from any input energy from the outside."
"Unknown","01;18;56;28","01;19;30;23","So so this is the physical meaning of the time, irreversible part of the dynamic when when there is something irreversible quote, it means that there is actually energy coming in from the outside. And this is also like it ties in nicely with biological systems we know that download ecosystems consume energy from the outside. So we know that they have to be that they need to have some kind of this irreversible dynamic thanks, Lance."
"Unknown","01;19;31;00","01;19;52;04","So anyone else in the live chat who wants to ask a question? This would be a good time to go for it, then Dean and then anyone else that's be gentle on me. What I'm about to put it out there is I just feel really vulnerable, but I'm going to throw it out there anyway. So lots of chatter, chatter about the encoded aspect of this."
"Unknown","01;19;52;04","01;20;18;29","And I think we all understand what that means. So I'm going I'm going to raise a metaphoric kind of a around negative space. And the idea of threading a needle, which is if you think about it as a disk, as a distributive exercise, is plenty complex. Like there's a lot of math in terms of being able to just do that thing that's that's hard, hard enough."
"Unknown","01;20;19;19","01;20;44;05","So if I'm trying to explain to somebody else a Bayesian manifold and what that represents can I say that it's both a barrier and a filter at the same time. Can I say that it acts kind of like a sieve mean meaning that it's mathematical structure kind of acts as a ground to the physical things that we are inferring are going on in the world."
"Unknown","01;20;45;02","01;21;20;14","So I guess what I'm asking is, is statistical mechanics serving to allow us to understand what negative space is as a non form within all as part of all the forms that we're seeing the edges of and and having a liminal understanding until we get to the very limits of what and in the high definition of what that means, so does the statistical manifold allow us to go in around and pass through zero?"
"Unknown","01;21;20;14","01;21;40;19","It doesn't allow us to reverse the spin of the solenoid or but it does allow us to get away from zero and move closer to what the known is. Because if I, if we continue to kind of go back and forth between the physical math and the statistical math, I know why we have to kind of talk about both at once."
"Unknown","01;21;40;19","01;22;09;24","Like we have to have two hands clap. But I think it's I think what ends up happening is in this conversation, the encoding and the physical piece tends to dominate and then and the nonphysical stuff, the statistical stuff, maybe that ground that the statistical manifold allows for, it doesn't it hasn't maybe been fully fleshed out in a way that helps me help explain it to other people who aren't as far along in this journey as you are."
"Unknown","01;22;09;24","01;22;36;12","And I'm hoping to get to a place where I can translate it for them. So maybe you can just talk to that a little bit about what is the statistical manifold? Is it just the hard stuff that we see or should we be paying attention to? Maybe the spaces between all of those data points? Right. Yeah, so that's a very interesting and actually I've a hard question to answer."
"Unknown","01;22;37;25","01;23;05;12","But just to start with the easy part, the statistical manifold is the mathematical object that says these are all the beliefs, all the different beliefs that you could hold about your environment. Right. And so as time as time evolves and you're gathering information near what your brain is doing is moving on this statistical vertical, your beliefs are changing over time."
"Unknown","01;23;06;02","01;23;35;06","And then in terms of explaining it to people. So the always the way the way that I try to explain it is that this this information of things, encoding things, things, encoding information about other things is just a different description of the world. So we have a description that that things like matter and ways and voices and things like that."
"Unknown","01;23;35;18","01;23;46;28","And then we have a different description that looks at information. And I think these two descriptions are equivalent it is just two different ways to talk about the same thing."
"Unknown","01;23;49;00","01;24;23;01","On the other hand, this way, way of talking about the world in terms of information flows and information processing I think it might be more general in the sense that instead of needing to have like matter and all these different concepts, different kinds of particles and it gets really messy, maybe it would be possible to unify more with the concept of information, because with information you can explain what a futon is and what what a proton is and you name it."
"Unknown","01;24;23;01","01;24;55;19","So, so it would be more, more unified and maybe more mathematically simple at the end of the day. But that remains to be seen, interestingly. So so this this guy Wolfram from the computational engine of WolframAlpha. So this guy this guy is actually a physicist. I didn't know that until very recently, but he has been doing some really interesting work over the past few years, working towards a theory of everything that is based on the concept of information."
"Unknown","01;24;56;01","01;25;28;17","So information and computation is the like the thing he starts with. And then I think he's managed to he basically postulates that the that the the world evolves in time according to some kind of computation. That's recursively applied to itself. So you can think of it in terms of a dynamical system, but it's like the way he thinks about it is a bit more general."
"Unknown","01;25;29;07","01;25;57;14","It would be like maybe you give a number to a program and then the program outputs the number and then so that would be one step. And then you reapplied the program to that number. That would be another time step. And so he can he and so he posted the needs of the universe works in that way. It moves according to like these speed steps with the repeated program and the program would be the laws of physics."
"Unknown","01;25;57;25","01;26;30;10","It's like kind of an abstract informational way to look at it. And so the so yeah, so he, he makes this this very abstract approach to physics and, and also very simple, I mean, the very kind of unified approach to physics. And I think he's managed to derive approximations to the equations of relativity just with that. So with a certain kind of program, I mean, anyway, he's been doing some really interesting work trying to unify known physics with the concept of information."
"Unknown","01;26;31;03","01;26;59;08","And he's written a very nice article like a blog post about it. I think if you, if you Google like of Wolfram Theory of everything, you might, you might come up, you might come up. And, but yeah, it's, I mean, it's not, it's not technical. I mean it is technical somehow, but it's not like there's no equations. It's conceptually, I think conceptually what he does, but the way he explains it is nice."
"Unknown","01;27;00;29","01;27;28;14","So yeah, I think we're moving to this kind of information based physics, but it doesn't mean that the physics that we know with matter and so on should be discarded is just like different, different levels to talk about it. Just like we have psychology that talks about the brain from a very overall perspective. And then we have like yeah, talking about like maybe biases, our biases, decision making."
"Unknown","01;27;28;14","01;27;56;23","So that would be one description of the world. And then we have molecular dynamics. Then we look at the brain from a very from a basic molecular level and all these descriptions have to fit together somehow. And I think depending, depending on what we're trying to ask of one description would be more fit than the other. So if I'm studying a human psychology is probably much more useful than molecular dynamics."
"Unknown","01;27;58;17","01;28;24;01","Thanks, Lance. One quick comment on the information is it allows us to drop into a mode of matter and organization as information which is still within the objective stance, but also it allows us to model ourselves and our beliefs and thinking about them informationally about other beliefs or about matter which is a way of mathematically complementing the relational stance."
"Unknown","01;28;24;17","01;28;50;20","So it also moves us towards Wolfram Vision of what new science would look like because we actually have quantitative relational techniques that help us deal with our uncertainty and about the way that we interact with the world actively interfering and measuring and manipulating, not just like us, walled off as the investigator, trying to get to the most exact framing of a system."
"Unknown","01;28;51;01","01;29;21;18","So it's a it's really interesting developments. So we have time for some more questions. So Scott and then after that we'll go to Steven. So go ahead, Scott. A couple of little thoughts on that last bit. So that that multiple dynamics that you were talking about, very interesting. It got me thinking about that coast of England problem, the freedom from fractals where if you measure the coast of England with a one mile yardstick versus a one inch yardstick, if it's a one inch yardstick, the coast of England is longer, right?"
"Unknown","01;29;21;18","01;29;47;15","It's because you're measuring more of the nooks and crannies right in the fractal coast. So that scale dependance. When you talk about the dependency, we see nature and see biology through different lenses. It's kind of interesting if if we have a unifying lens maybe you start to have a fractal and scale independent descriptors, then we'll pop out of that because you'll start to have things that will anyway."
"Unknown","01;29;47;16","01;30;09;18","So it feels like this. We're coming at descriptions of systems, as you were saying, from different in different ways. They're the same system ultimately. And so there'll be an interesting analysis on the way in which they come together, I guess. Is that just one piece? Another thing the mentioned about information and the that kind of Wolfram idea, that expansion?"
"Unknown","01;30;10;17","01;30;41;19","One of the things I had a conversation with a couple of astrophysicists and I was talking to them about Seth Lloyd out of MIT, a part of his book called Programing the Universe. He talks about the idea that all interactions since the Big Bang have increased exponentially, just the number, the volume of interactions. And I was talking to somebody about it and they said, well, if the universe is made of information and then the exponential increase in information, maybe that's what dark energy is."
"Unknown","01;30;41;19","01;31;04;25","We perceive dark energy, that expansion force, as being with something. But really what it is, is the universe expanding out exponentially because it's made of information. And so it's something just to think about. It kind of leaps around there between physics and information theory, but there's that's one other piece of it. And then the other piece of it was this idea, the outside energy you were talking about before, the need for outside energy."
"Unknown","01;31;05;04","01;31;30;18","One of the things that I've been first around with is whether in fact and in 2013 I did a presentation at MIT called Entropy Accounting, and then the year after they did something called Entropy Engines and the idea that was, was that in information theory and Kano's equation, you need a hot and cold differential to perform work. Kano's equation, those differentials are identical to arbitrage differentials you need for a market to to move."
"Unknown","01;31;30;27","01;31;52;29","If there's no information differentials, you don't have trading in markets. And so one of the questions is Roger Penrose wrote a book recently about the time before the Big Bang. What he talks about is we have the yellow light of the sun come in and the infrared light go out. We don't overheat except for climate change and carbon dioxide blankets because the net energy gain is zero right energy."
"Unknown","01;31;52;29","01;32;15;09","And in other words, we'd overheat he said what we gain is neg entropy because the yellow light of the sun has a higher information carrying capacity than the red light. It goes out. Plants construct themselves from the light of the sun, create neg entropy and then we now projecting forward are now burning that fossil fuel that stored up that neg entropy."
"Unknown","01;32;15;15","01;32;59;01","And we're releasing disorder in the form of now climate change disorder, political and social disorder. So we're jumping around there is suggesting that disorder, accounting and entropy occurring when you have von Neumann and Shannon's link of physics and information and other links like we have here, that maybe when we're talking about entropy as disorder, we can talk about it not by analogy, but a direct application to social contexts and start to use information and understand disorder in society and in markets as amenable to the same kind of math that we find in some of these biological systems."
"Unknown","01;32;59;01","01;33;31;13","Thanks. Just a few thoughts. Thanks, Lance. If you want to add anything. Sure. Yeah, that was very interesting. And yeah, so I want to add actually that all this the thing that we talk about, about reality can be described at different scales. And I think there's a nice extension to this work that speaks to that. You can if you look at a human, I mean, it's composed of a lot of cells and each has its own boundary."
"Unknown","01;33;31;24","01;34;04;26","And then these cells form organs that themselves have their own boundary. So there's this tree, this recursive aspect of like markup that is being assembled together at different scales and I think I think it would be interesting, interesting to impact that because I think that's how biological systems are formed. Both societies are formed this collections of multiple different individuals that are themselves that then self or organizations that that talk to each other and work together as a society."
"Unknown","01;34;05;08","01;34;38;19","There's really this recursive aspect and being able to hopefully use the same kind of math to talk about all these different aspects. And then also, I mean, people it's true, like a lot of people in the past, maybe ten, 20 years, maybe more, they've used the same kind of dynamical models that we have in this paper. And so very, very standard models to model for example, interactions between people and in particular models of opinion formation."
"Unknown","01;34;40;01","01;35;08;29","So for example, maybe let's say we're in the US and some people are Democrats, some of our Republicans, some cannot really make their mind yet. And so they would talk to each other, they would interact and then they would converge into a steady state where some yeah, some some people would be diehard Democrats in Massachusetts states and we kind of seeing that area, some people would be diehard publicans and some people would like, yeah, flutter."
"Unknown","01;35;09;00","01;35;39;08","It started in the middle. So I think we can use I mean this math about stochastic processes and information is really the yeah. The, the, the ground. I mean then a good framework or useful framework to model many kinds of things. Um, but then I think with a lot of these models are missing, it's really this belief based aspect."
"Unknown","01;35;39;24","01;36;14;03","So a lot of these models of opinion formation there, they just say, Oh, I'm a particle, you're a particle. And we interact just like particles in physics with interact. So, so it's based in this. So I think once you, I mean things are very small, maybe we can describe them in a very simple way. But as you as like Marco of self-organize at different scales and actually as you go to larger and larger scales things become a lot more complex."
"Unknown","01;36;14;16","01;36;39;14","And I would say maybe we are at the scale at which things are most complex or molecules tend to be quite simple. We tend to be quite complex. And then if you go up and up again, maybe to planets, then things start to become really simple again. Because all these random fluctuations are kind of average, average, average. And then we have Newtonian mechanics where everything kind of looks deterministic."
"Unknown","01;36;40;12","01;36;48;16","So I think there's this like sweet spot we're in where we're not too big and too small and interesting things happen there."
"Unknown","01;36;50;18","01;37;29;25","And that's where I would say that's where I would say Bayesian mechanics is hoping to fit in terms of explaining describing what's going on cool. So Stephen, go for it. OK, yeah. That, that the idea again, like brings us back to embodiment, I suppose because we embody that particular size and scale and they sort of say if you go right down to the smallest scale of like and then right up to the bigger scale, we are kind of in the middle ironically."
"Unknown","01;37;29;25","01;37;54;08","But so I was wondering how so following on from the U.S. and bringing in the computational psychiatry piece that you sort of alluded to to this is if we if we say that we've got everything that we perceive, even the physicality of the world, we actually only have access to information anyway, even if we are actually accessing the the true physical world."
"Unknown","01;37;54;24","01;38;19;10","So we've got this process of sense making that we're doing to make that idea of what is our consensus reality so far as kind of work in space that we're in is our consensus reality what's interesting is that with psychology and social sciences, you could almost say psychology is a bit like the predictive processing model of the world."
"Unknown","01;38;19;10","01;38;45;21","It's like these are predicted ways that are out there that have been chosen as the models within a particular sort of discrete spaces, and those are externally managed. So there's like an externally managed system entry and there could be an entry, could be secreting system or it looks like there is, although entropy is not actually a substance to secrete per say."
"Unknown","01;38;46;04","01;39;29;08","And you could say that it's externally managed information geometry, that the social science as well with the averages and the psychometrics that they reference to, they're all sort of housed out there in the world and you've kind of got the kind of what we see is our reality in the phenomenology of our experience is kind of the boundary, but what your work's doing and what computational psychiatry does and which we're not able to do without those tools is it enables us to go into that neurobiology and the actual like the internal, internally managed stochastic dynamics of our own models, so to speak, and not the ones that we make out there to be our perspective"
"Unknown","01;39;29;08","01;40;06;13","on which we try and reduce free energy around. But just what is the models that we're doing, what you call entropy consuming? I we're actually just swimming in that entropy and finding the variations we and so I'm curious like that, that that ability for this type of work to contribute to a new kind of way of knowing about what it is to be in the world and go into our internal models rather than be reliant on these external psychological and social science models."
"Unknown","01;40;06;23","01;40;50;20","What are your thoughts on how this might link into developing that field so so are you talking specifically about the link between all this physics and the psychology or is your question a bit more general? Well, maybe the the boundary between the kind of like the scales of basically the boundary of going for externally making models of the world and standard models like psychologists are doing and social scientists are doing and psychometrics and the ability to actually go into our own models, our own phenomenological neuro biological models and just say, OK, what are the dynamics that were alive, not well?"
"Unknown","01;40;50;21","01;41;18;23","And how how are we actually managing, not how do we manage our models of what we think they are, which is kind of what happens in our kind of niche, but we're able to probe our own phenomenology. So I was wondering how you see that tying into that. Yeah, yeah. That's a that's a really good point. So so as you point out, I mean, no models in psychology and, and computational psychiatry."
"Unknown","01;41;18;23","01;41;47;11","I mean, they're driven by intuition. They're driven by, by experiments, and they're driven also by their own biases and their observations about. Yeah, patients who suffer some some kind of yes. Some kind of, let's say, schizophrenia. And so we know we know schizophrenic patients behave like this and like that. And so we try to create models that kind of reproduce that."
"Unknown","01;41;47;28","01;42;44;22","And then we try to divide these models by saying, oh, maybe I can simulate some kind of an action potentials of some neurons. And then I'm going to check whether actually these organisms that I'm studying have this same kind of action potentials of thinking of electrophysiological responses so I think that I mean, I think that's really good. And and the research is doing a lot of progress, but then this kind of works not not this paper, but this kind of work would be able to to like go to the I mean, um, I mean, takes a different perspective and would be able ultimately, hopefully to describe mathematically what thinking like a human is, what what"
"Unknown","01;42;44;22","01;43;16;21","is being human mathematically. And of course, they want to be like a definition of this is a human that they would hopefully be in the future a mathematical description of how we make decisions and what class of models we implementing to make sense of the world and how can we characterize these models in terms of and hopefully the community will get to that to do physical experiments."
"Unknown","01;43;16;21","01;44;03;01","We also through like just mathematical conceptualization. I think using using mathematics you can you kind of get you kind of just get there without any kind of experiment, but you still can there's still quite a few constraints that we have on that. We know that humans have legs, for example, breaking detail, balloons, creation of entropy, all these things we know, we know humans satisfy like I mean, they have a lot of characteristics and we can incorporate that in the physics and I think this really constrains the amount of space that the then people in psychology can go and look into."
"Unknown","01;44;04;27","01;44;27;20","So it just feels like when you're digging a tunnel and psychology would like kind of digging one way and Bayesian mechanics would be digging from the other direction, and at some point they will meet in the middle, hopefully. But I don't I don't think they have met really yet. And it will take a while Awesome."
"Unknown","01;44;30;00","01;45;01;16","What a fun discussion. And it's so cool how this paper, it's almost like there was a few stairs. We, we explored some basic ways to frame how nodes on a Bayesian graph insulate other sets of nodes and then how that conditional independence can be finessed for these increasingly developed and elaborated networks that do as we talked about expectations over external states all the way up to variational base."
"Unknown","01;45;02;00","01;45;22;11","And then it's like we at the top or at the middle of that staircase started taking it in a lot of other directions. So this was really a fun discussion just in the last few minutes. Maybe we can any and all of us think like, what are we going to continue working on? For some of us, that's probably a research project."
"Unknown","01;45;22;25","01;45;48;22","Others that's, I don't know, lunch or something else. Just how are we going to keep on learning about this and start to apply it in our own work or research so we're really focused on labs. Are you working on the next paper where you're going to practice in the external database? Or have you started or it's just like clicking on a backburner somewhere."
"Unknown","01;45;49;24","01;46;37;17","It's not cooking yet, so you can you're more than welcome to go ahead and start plowing. It's at the farmer's markets. The ingredients are still out there. And Dave also raised in an email, some really interesting questions about other partitioning and basically philosophical threads that might be translated into different possible partitioning things within internal states or other ways of partitioning, because it was the partitioning of the blanket states from kind of one set of blanketing states into incoming sensory and outgoing action active states that allowed for this perception as inference action planning US inference step."
"Unknown","01;46;38;02","01;47;02;27","And it's not that that's the end game of node partitioning. So there's so many ways that these partitions can continue. Stephen Yeah, I'm going to be, I'm trying see how I like that analogy. The two tunnels or whichever way the maybe it's a whole load of like insect warrens or whatever is trying to meet and so psychology and bringing together some of these processes."
"Unknown","01;47;02;27","01;47;24;01","So I'm going to try and bring that together maybe more actually not so much from a clinical perspective, but maybe more from a community psychology and psychosocial psychosocial methodologies that might be used. So I'm going to be cheering on that as best I can. So maybe if I'm ever stuck, I might fire you an email if that's okay."
"Unknown","01;47;27;11","01;47;53;03","Yeah, there's many ways we can continue. And also, I think all along our trails we dropped a few little notes for some other pieces that could come into play. If anyone else wants to raise their gypsy hands, we can take it last thought. Otherwise, though, just in closing, Lance, this was awesome and Connor as well for joining the first livestream."
"Unknown","01;47;53;03","01;48;16;20","This was a great development we all learned a ton. So I hope those watching live or in replay also got something out of this paper. You're always welcome back any time you want to jump on a guest stream or be a participant. Just always welcome. Thank you so much, Daniel. And thank you everyone for the discussion. I really enjoyed it."
"Unknown","01;48;17;24","01;48;22;06","OK, see everyone next time. Thanks. Bye."
"Unknown","01;48;25;07","01;48;41;20","Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks everyone. Great times. Thanks everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone. Great times. Thanks everyone. Great times. Thanks, everyone for."
