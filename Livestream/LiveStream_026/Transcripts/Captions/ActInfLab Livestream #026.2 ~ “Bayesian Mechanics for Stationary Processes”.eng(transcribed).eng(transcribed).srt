00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,040
hello everyone welcome to the active

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
inference lab

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,720
we're here on august 17 2021

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
in live stream number 26.2

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,720
on

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,240
the second discussion that we're having

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,840
as a group on the paper bayesian

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
mechanics for stationary processes

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
welcome to the active inference lab

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,079
everyone we are a participatory online

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,480
lab that is communicating learning and

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,040
practicing applied active inference you

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960
can find us at the links here on this

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,079
page

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
this is recorded in an archived live

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
feedback so that we can improve on our

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,399
work

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,719
welcome here and we'll be following

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,480
video etiquette for live streams so we

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
can use the raise hand feature in jitsi

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
this short link has the upcoming live

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
stream discussions

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
here we are on august 17th in our last

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
discussion on this paper 26.2 next week

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
we'll be heading into a new paper and we

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
still have some openings in the coming

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
weeks so if anyone has a suggestion or

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
an author to contact or wants to discuss

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
their own paper just let us know and we

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,320
can try to make that happen

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
today in acting stream number 26.2 the

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
goal is to continue learning and

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,119
discussing and unpacking this awesome

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
paper that we've been thinking about for

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,119
the last few weeks bayesian mechanics

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
for stationary processes and we're

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
really appreciative that the first

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
author is here to join with us and

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
co-learn with us have fun with us

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,119
and this video is just going to be

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,680
wherever we want to take it so we have

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
some questions prepared but especially

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
if anyone in the live chat has questions

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,759
that'd be awesome and we can definitely

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
address them

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
so we can just start with a quick

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,640
introduction round and feel free just to

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
say hello or to

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
answer one of these questions like

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
what's something that you liked or

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
remembered about the paper and what's

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
something that you're wondering about or

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
want to have resolved by the end of

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360
today so i'm daniel i'm a postdoctoral

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
researcher in california

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
and

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
something that

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,879
over the last week

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
made me excited to

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
have this discussion was i was speaking

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
with a physicist friend someone who's

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
working with lasers and oscilloscopes

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,000
and stuff

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,319
and i brought up this paper

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
and they

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
it turned out that they actually were

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
using pid control

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
in their research on a day-to-day basis

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
but actually it was new for them to hear

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
about how it was connected to some of

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
these broader topics but as soon as i

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
brought out the physical printed paper

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
then they were just so excited and it

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
was cool to see how they had all this

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
practical

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
experience working with pid

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
and then they instantly just saw that

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
there was kind of this crossover point

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
into some broader questions that also

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
they were curious about but the

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
day-to-day practice actually hadn't

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,159
brought them to those general questions

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
so it was a and i learned a lot about

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,120
pid control and about actually how it

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
plays out with the knobs and everything

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,720
like that i'll pass to dean

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
yeah good morning um

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
yeah i

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
i came away from the paper again trying

92
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,239
to figure out

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
how to

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
create some sort of a coherent narrative

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
around

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
the the

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,560
physical math and the statistical math

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
that part for me

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
really got me going away and thinking a

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
little bit because i think they they go

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
in different directions but i do think

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,080
that they can work in concerts so

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,519
yeah i'd be really interested to see how

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
that

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
might play out in terms of

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
what what our

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
our guest here um

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
thinks the directions this might be able

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,480
to go i'll pass it to stephen

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,239
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
um

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,879
i work a lot with

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
community development and uh sort of

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
spatial meaning making so inferences of

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
different kinds

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,478
i'm curious

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
how some of the

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
ways that the mathematics have been done

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
on this paper

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
can

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
help

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
broaden some of the questions around

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
ergodicity and non-ergodicity in uh

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
that's a bit of a thorn sometimes a

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,479
weapon

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
in the inactivist

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
active influence dialogue so um yeah any

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,479
and that's something i'll be interested

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
in and um i'm going to pass this over to

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
dave

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
so i think dave doesn't have audio but

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
dave thanks for joining and any

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
questions in the youtube live chat is

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
awesome so thanks

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
to everyone who's joined and passed to

136
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
lance

137
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
thanks daniel and thanks for inviting me

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
again

139
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
uh sam nance i'm a phd student at

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
imperial and ucl

141
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,560
and i'm really excited to be here and to

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
engage in this discussion

143
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,800
i'm really looking forward to

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
feedback about the paper seeing what's

145
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
interesting to to pursue in future work

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
um so yeah really looking forward to

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,520
to share this paper with you and and

148
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
talk about it

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
so maybe one lead-in question before we

150
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
jump to the content what stage in your

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,919
phd are you

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,560
and is this like the meat and potatoes

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
chapter one or is this um a little

154
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,479
cul-de-sac that you found yourself

155
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
having to explore

156
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
in the course of another research

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
project

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
um yeah great question so i'm right in

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
the middle of my phd i'm two years in to

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
still have two years to go

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
and um

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,880
ideally i would like to pursue this work

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
but so i have two supervisors one is a

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
mathematician

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,360
another one is a neuroscientist

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
and so really the the goal

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
is to is to have some kind of

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
mathematical theory of how adaptive

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
systems work so i think this is really

170
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
the the first chapter

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
i want to push that further

172
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,479
but then there are also other projects

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
that take up my time so i'm trying to

174
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,159
make all that work together

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
awesome

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
so

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
for this dot two we have some questions

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,199
prepared some topics that we know we to

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
talk about but anyone who asks a

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
question in a live chat will definitely

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,840
have

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
time to address that

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
the paper that we've been talking about

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
is this bayesian mechanics for

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
stationary processes paper and in the

186
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
dot zero and the dot one there's more

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
information on the primary aims and

188
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
claims so check those out if you haven't

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,720
already

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
we're just going to

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
take one more look at the road map

192
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
where we've been where we're going

193
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
remember we were talking about markov

194
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,360
blankets and basic mechanics how does

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
active inference have similarities and

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
differences from

197
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
other ways to model dynamical systems

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,280
and let's just go straight to the first

199
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
question that we have which is going to

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
help us

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
review where we've been and then also as

202
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
a jumping off point for some of these

203
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
extended questions that we've already

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
written

205
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,599
so a colleague asked me

206
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,280
and said i think it would be good to

207
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
expand on the differences of the

208
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
paradigms in section 3. and those are

209
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
section b c and d

210
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,919
related to a posteriori estimation after

211
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,039
the fact

212
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,960
predictive processing and variational

213
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
base so perhaps lance first and then

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
anyone else who wants to give a take or

215
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
ask a follow-up question

216
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
what are the similarities and the

217
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
differences here and why were they

218
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,879
structured in this order is this the

219
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
chronological order is this most

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
specific to least specific or what is

221
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
the ordering and the meaning here

222
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,319
right um

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
yeah so so the

224
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
it goes from the the simplest to the

225
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,479
most sophisticated

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,840
um so

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,879
uh adversary estimation is a special

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
case of predictive processing which is

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
specific

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,639
special case of variational base

231
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
and so the idea

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,759
is

233
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
if you

234
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
if you receive some piece of data so for

235
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
example if you see an image

236
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
um with your eyes you're gonna try to

237
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
infer what's going on

238
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
outside in the environment and so if you

239
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
do a posterior estimation

240
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
what you're trying to guess is what is

241
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
the most likely thing

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,279
um like what what is the most likely

243
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,839
thing that's going on in the environment

244
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
so it could be if you if you see an

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
image of a chair you you would say oh

246
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,560
it's a chair

247
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,800
but you wouldn't encode any any kind of

248
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,279
uncertainty oh it might be like an

249
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
armchair for example or something a bit

250
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
different so in a posterior estimation

251
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
you try to guess what's going on outside

252
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
but there's no uncertainty

253
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
then predictive processing you encode

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
the uncertainty so mathematically

255
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
that's called the variance or the ov

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
precision

257
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
and then variation of bayes it's uh it's

258
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
more sophisticated so you actually

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
encode

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,399
uh an arbitrary distribution

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
uh on external states um so it could be

262
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
oh it's very likely that it's an

263
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
armchair

264
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
and it might also be very likely that

265
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
it's a cat so that this example doesn't

266
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
make sense but you

267
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
you could imagine that there's two

268
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
things that are very different that

269
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
could be equally likely so for example

270
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
if you see an illusion it could be

271
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
something but also something very

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
different so you would imagine these two

273
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
things of having

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
a high probability of being there and

275
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
then other things are having low

276
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
probability

277
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
so this is really um

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,240
the the most general thing uh and also

279
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
as a side comment so rational base um

280
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
like a lot of machine learning

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
algorithms you can see them as special

282
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
cases of variational base so i think

283
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
this is really the most general way to

284
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
think about inference

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
and and this is really at the heart of

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
the free energy principle

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
and i think this is why people have been

288
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
describing the brain as performing

289
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
variation of base

290
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,399
because it's really the most general way

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
to think about this kind of problem of

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,959
inference

293
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
awesome well

294
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
before i give a comment on that what

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
made you say that it was at the heart of

296
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
the free energy principle

297
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
right

298
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
so the free energy principle

299
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
says that the brain is doing a

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
variational base

301
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,800
and and then all this work i mean this

302
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
paper in particular but like

303
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,079
um

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,920
the last decade people have been trying

305
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
to justify

306
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,800
why would the free energy principle

307
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,839
apply actually

308
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,640
um and so and so this is part of uh this

309
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,480
paper is part of a line of work where we

310
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
try to examine physical systems or like

311
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
adaptive systems and see whether we can

312
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
describe them as performing variational

313
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
base

314
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,360
great so first stephen with a question

315
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
and then anyone else with a question

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
thanks that's really helpful that

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
explanation and i was wondering

318
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,959
is it a case then that you can go only

319
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
so far with say predictive processing

320
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,800
um and then to get to variational bays

321
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
you could and to bring in that

322
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
uncertainty you kind of need a free

323
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,800
energy

324
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,120
principle solution to be able to bring

325
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,079
in these

326
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
more unknown models and

327
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,040
to go beyond variational bays at some

328
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,959
point that's when you'd have to bring in

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
the active inference

330
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,519
to

331
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
it would that be a kind of the way you

332
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
would think about it

333
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,079
yeah yeah we i would think about it like

334
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
this um

335
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
i would say uh like loosely speaking the

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
term predictive processing

337
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
i think is also meant uh to refer to

338
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
variational base but at least a

339
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,519
variational base that's like a proper

340
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
mathematical definition of what it is

341
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,600
and then predictive processing it's more

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,839
like oh we're predicting something so

343
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,160
it's not that clear how how

344
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
i mean there's no clear definition of

345
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
predictive processing uh but in this

346
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
paper predictive processing is meant as

347
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,519
predictive coding

348
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
as in like the papers by ryo and ballard

349
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,240
where they looked at the visual system

350
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,079
and then they looked at

351
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
neurons in the cortex as

352
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
forming predictions and

353
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
suppressing prediction errors

354
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
um so yeah um

355
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
if you if you only do predictive

356
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
processing in in this sense i i think

357
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
you're you're limited

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,880
and variational base and active

359
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
inference is really like the the next

360
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
generation because you can accommodate

361
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
all sorts of models

362
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,000
and um and yeah i don't i don't think it

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
i mean i i cannot see at least uh how

364
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
you would go beyond that

365
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
thank you so

366
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,839
dean with a raised hand and then anyone

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,279
else

368
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,839
no that's i was curious so

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
it seems like the math is able to

370
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,399
help us understand the difference

371
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
between something that's really highly

372
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,120
defined

373
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
so that kind of a posterior posteriori

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
and then the sort of the fuzzy

375
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
where the very old variational base part

376
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
sort of gives us something

377
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
a little more a little less defined in

378
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
terms of the edges

379
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,639
and so i was just curious

380
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,600
does the brain kind of go back and forth

381
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
to to some degree mathematically

382
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
speaking between that which is really

383
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
clear and really

384
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
has a hard edge mathematically and and

385
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
those things which statistically

386
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
seem to

387
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
distribute within the within the

388
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
parameter set

389
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
um

390
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
yeah i mean i think

391
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,760
all these three um like a posterior

392
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
estimation as well as variational base

393
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
there's uh displausible explanations for

394
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
how the brain would implement them okay

395
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
and so so the idea

396
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
the idea for um

397
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
variational base or predictive

398
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,279
processing is that so the brain would be

399
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,600
encoding some kind of uncertainty

400
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
and so in the literature

401
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
people say that the the mean firing rate

402
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
of a neural population

403
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
would encode the posterior estimates so

404
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
what you think is actually out there and

405
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,920
then the variance of the firing rates

406
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
would encode your uncertainty

407
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
so i think

408
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
so i think there's possible plausible

409
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
theories for how the brain would

410
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
implement all of these things

411
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,480
and then i think the that's the nice

412
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,079
thing at least with active inference is

413
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,360
that we try to develop models

414
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
that are consistent with our

415
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
understanding of the brain and as our

416
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
understanding of the brain evolves we

417
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,199
kind of like refine these models

418
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
um so so i think

419
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
we're definitely working towards uh

420
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
models

421
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,360
that that do explain at least i mean so

422
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
far it's very coarse grain and very

423
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
simplistic but we're working towards

424
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
models

425
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,560
that could be implemented in the brain

426
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
so i think like these um

427
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
very very abstract very general form of

428
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,120
variational base could be implemented in

429
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,839
the

430
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
brain one quick follow-up is you

431
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,600
mentioned how the mean firing rate

432
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,199
corresponds to this

433
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,160
first

434
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
a posteriority estimation which is a

435
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
mean estimation and then there's the

436
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,079
variance in the firing rate so what

437
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,040
measurements or what does it look like

438
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
to implement variational bays in the

439
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,480
brain like what measurements are we

440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
making what kinds of analyses would we

441
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
make on those just like mean and

442
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
variance

443
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,040
um

444
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,000
well so so the idea i mean the very

445
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
simple idea is that you would get some

446
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
sensory stimulus so

447
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
you you get some some impression on your

448
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,279
retina

449
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
uh some neurons in your retina with fire

450
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,839
uh into the into the visual cortex and

451
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,199
then um

452
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
the the the premise is that your brain

453
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,240
has

454
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
embodies them

455
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
a generative model of its environment so

456
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
so it's able

457
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
it has learned how to recognize uh how

458
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,120
to how to infer things in the

459
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
environment from its sensations

460
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,759
and so the

461
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
the stimulus that would be that would go

462
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
into into v1 and all these other parts

463
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
of visual cortex

464
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
and then the neurons in in the visual

465
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,600
cortex would uh

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
align their means firing rates with

467
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
respect to oh it's an armchair or it's

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
something different

469
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
um so maybe there's a neural population

470
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
that encores armchair and there's a

471
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
neural population that encodes something

472
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,000
else

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
there's also a lot of studies for

474
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
specific neurons like one neuron

475
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,959
encoding one particular stimulus

476
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,440
so these um there's these guys at mit

477
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,959
that show that there's actually a bill

478
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
clinton neuron uh that fires whenever

479
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,120
you see bill clinton so you can be very

480
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
specific

481
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
and um and yeah but if it's uncertain

482
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
that it's bill clinton your

483
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
your bill clinton neuron would like fire

484
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
yeah i guess would have a lot of

485
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,400
variance in its firing rate

486
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
okay awesome so welcome

487
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,119
blue with a raised hand go for it and

488
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
then um we'll continue and also steven

489
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
so go ahead blue

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
um i am blue knight and i'm an

491
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
independent research consultant from new

492
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
mexico and i have a question on your

493
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
paper and it's kind of something that

494
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
i've been questioning a lot lately with

495
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,919
regards to

496
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,600
the free energy principle and the

497
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
requirement for ergodicity

498
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
um and my question is um in your paper

499
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
you said that the um

500
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
you know this the outline even in

501
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
outline it says you know you you

502
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
partition the world with the markov

503
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
blanket and then you equip the partition

504
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,240
with stochastic dynamics and so i'm

505
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,039
wondering how these stochastic dynamics

506
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
relate to organicity if at all

507
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
and if that fulfills the requirement for

508
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,919
um ergonomy as

509
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,320
necessary by the fbp

510
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,559
right yeah that that's a great question

511
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,039
um yeah i think i think stephen also

512
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
also wanted to talk about that so it's

513
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,559
great that you bring this up

514
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,919
um

515
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,960
so

516
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
yeah so so the idea of these stochastic

517
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,880
dynamics is that we don't assume that

518
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
dynamics are deterministic and it makes

519
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
sense because

520
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
um you can describe planets as having

521
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,799
deterministic dynamics but when you talk

522
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
about biological systems

523
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
things are a lot more messy and if

524
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,559
you're not

525
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
modeling them at the molecular level

526
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,039
which you which you never are

527
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,520
things are stochastic

528
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,240
so then the the assumption on our system

529
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
is is that it's stationary

530
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
and this is really what it means to to

531
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
be adaptive so you're preserving some

532
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
kind of steady state

533
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
but we never assume ergodicity

534
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
so there's actually um a deep um

535
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
so stationary and ergodicity are not the

536
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
same so we assume

537
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
stationarity but we don't assume

538
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,080
ergodicity and so if daniel you could go

539
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,960
to the appendix b

540
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
there's um there's a figure i think

541
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
which would be the best way to

542
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,679
to illustrate a bit below

543
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,880
yeah perfect

544
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
so

545
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
um

546
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
here in this appendix we

547
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
we illustrate uh some dynamics that are

548
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,120
ergodic and some dynamics that are not

549
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
ergotic

550
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,679
so

551
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
if you if you look at the

552
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,520
uh top left top and bottom left panels

553
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
these dynamics are ergotic and and so

554
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
the

555
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
i guess the intuitive definition of

556
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
ergodicity

557
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
is that

558
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
here you have the the steady state in

559
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,000
blue so so regions that are very blue

560
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
are regions of high probability mass

561
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,559
under the state state of regions where

562
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,919
you

563
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,919
your dynamic is likely to be in and

564
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,760
regions are less blue

565
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
you're less likely to be in

566
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,159
now ergodicity means that if you start

567
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,720
your dynamic anywhere

568
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
and you and you let it run for a

569
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
sufficient amount of time so like you

570
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,799
observe your biological system for a

571
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,240
very long time

572
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
um your dynamic would basically sample

573
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
the whole distribution it would go

574
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,600
i mean if you if you give it enough time

575
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
it would go really far away

576
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
and then it will come back and it will

577
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
do all sorts of things as you can see in

578
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,840
the bottom left and bottom right

579
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,360
um so this is ergotic now in the

580
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,000
in the in the bottom oh no in the top

581
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
left and and bottom left it's it's

582
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
ergotic and then the

583
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
bottom right it's not ergotic

584
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
and so

585
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,919
um so as you can see if you start the

586
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
dynamic on the bottom right anywhere

587
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
it will go around an orbit they won't

588
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
sample the whole distribution so it's

589
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
still confined to like a

590
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,760
a small region

591
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,600
and and so this this uh so the the paper

592
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,880
still applies for these kind of dynamics

593
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
um

594
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
see i don't i don't know does that help

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
or do you

596
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
or was that

597
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,039
not very clear it's so such a follow-up

598
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,600
the paper does apply in

599
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
situations where it's not

600
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
that's what you said right right we yeah

601
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,159
we don't need aerodynacity well so even

602
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
within like a steady state

603
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
um like so biological systems you know

604
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,520
operate

605
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
within homeostasis but it's a range

606
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
right so so it's not

607
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
like a constant it's not like you know

608
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
purely we're not at 37 degrees all the

609
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,679
time right like so there's some

610
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
fluctuation all the time within that

611
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
steady

612
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
state and and so i just want to kind of

613
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,159
how you rectify those concepts like is

614
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
it like a restricting of the the state

615
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
space or or how does that work

616
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,880
um

617
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
so so the this idea of homeostasis

618
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
that's that's really the the steady

619
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
state assumption

620
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
so for example um

621
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
in the state space maybe you would have

622
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
one one uh one coordinate that describes

623
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
the temperature of your

624
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
of your biological system

625
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,559
and if it's a human um

626
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,320
then you will have regions of very high

627
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
probability so here regions in blue

628
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,039
around 37 degrees and then regions that

629
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,720
are less blue

630
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,960
uh like a bit further away

631
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,039
uh and so the dynamic

632
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,520
i mean your your system can evolve in in

633
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
all of these regions just like on

634
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,480
average you will be more often around 37

635
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,120
degrees just because that's how we are

636
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
and then but sometimes it will be higher

637
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
and sometimes it will be lower and and

638
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
so this is all allowed

639
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,080
um and so i guess the this ergodicity

640
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
assumption so then if you assumed

641
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,520
that the biological system was ergodic

642
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,400
then this would imply that if you if you

643
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
leave the biological system

644
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,640
like run for a sufficiently long time

645
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
like you observe it for a very long time

646
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,919
it will basically um

647
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,840
it will sample your whole distribution

648
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
of temperatures

649
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
um

650
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
so so maybe

651
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,159
um

652
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,159
so so

653
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,640
maybe like the the temperature that

654
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
um a human body is allowed to have are

655
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,320
between like 36 and 39 let's just say

656
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,440
for for simplicity and so ergodicity

657
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
would say

658
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,280
um yeah if i if i observed my biological

659
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,919
system for a sufficiently long time

660
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,159
i would see my biological system at all

661
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
these temperatures

662
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,640
and i think maybe

663
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
maybe that would happen so maybe our uh

664
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
maybe temperature is like uh

665
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
we're ergotic with respect to

666
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,640
temperature but maybe there's other

667
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
things in which we aren't ergotic

668
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,720
and um

669
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
and i think the the previous papers on

670
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,640
the free energy principle they

671
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,279
for simplicity they always took like um

672
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,600
they always assumed some kind of dynamic

673
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
and it turned out to be ergotic

674
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,320
and so in here we we're not making that

675
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,799
assumption

676
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,520
so

677
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
i'm sorry i'm going to just follow with

678
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,679
one more question daniel is that okay

679
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,880
yeah um

680
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,159
so so

681
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
you know it's great right if you're

682
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,000
talking about one human system right

683
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
like my mark on blanket the partitions

684
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,320
like internal and external states and so

685
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
i have my one human system or even

686
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
multiple human systems like we will

687
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
operate in the same kind of steady state

688
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
based range but but if we're talking

689
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
really about um you know collections and

690
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,039
how kind of

691
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
collective dynamics and overlapping

692
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,960
markup blankets

693
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
do you think it's mathematically

694
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,520
possible to extend the state space like

695
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,919
i can operate you know from 36 to 39

696
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,400
that's an okay temperature for me but

697
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
like a reptile has a very different kind

698
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
of temperature range but clearly like we

699
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,559
have some interaction i have interaction

700
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,559
with the reptile and so there's some

701
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,480
some emergent dynamic between me and

702
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,440
some reptile future right right like so

703
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,919
can we define a state space like would

704
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,760
it be mathematically like

705
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
acceptable or is it like offensive

706
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
mathematically like

707
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
impossible to

708
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
define a state space where i'm allowed

709
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
to sample all of these temperature

710
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
ranges with my markup blanket but some

711
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,039
other feature in some kind of collective

712
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
dynamics is not like they have a

713
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
different range like is that still

714
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
organicity because it's not clearly i'm

715
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
not sampling the entire state space i'm

716
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,240
sampling my state space but like is that

717
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
confounding in some way i mean it is in

718
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
my brain that's why i'm asking yeah that

719
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
that's a really good question um so so

720
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
this is all fine so so we can do

721
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
everything you just said

722
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,840
and so when we um so actually when

723
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,039
when we say oh we so we we always sample

724
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,640
a distribution

725
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,400
we're not i mean and then the

726
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
distribution is on the safe space so

727
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
we're sampling the state space

728
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,760
but like if your distribution is

729
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,520
confined to a region of state space so

730
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,480
let's say

731
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
as a human um i cannot possibly have any

732
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
bodily temperatures below 36 degrees

733
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,039
then your then you would sample only

734
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,440
things are above 36 degrees

735
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
um so i think you would have your own uh

736
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
steady state your own stationary

737
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,320
distribution with temperatures around 37

738
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,559
degrees and then if there's a if there's

739
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
a snake also in the in this environment

740
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,279
that you're modeling then we'll have a

741
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,760
another very different steady state

742
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,120
and so

743
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,559
i think it really

744
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,120
uh your question really speaks to the

745
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
possible extensions of these of this

746
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,400
work

747
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
because in this paper we just say oh

748
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
there's like an internal state space

749
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,080
which would be what's inside

750
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
and then there's an external state space

751
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
which would be what's outside

752
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
but then um

753
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,760
really what what people would need to do

754
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
now is to say oh but my

755
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,840
actually there's a lot of very

756
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
interesting things in my environment

757
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,720
there may be snakes there may be

758
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
other kinds of animals and they all have

759
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
their own markov blanket and they all

760
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
have their own steady state so then what

761
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
you can do is to partition your external

762
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
state space into all of these things

763
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,000
that might be around you

764
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
and then instead of having

765
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,679
some kind of um

766
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
performing some kind of

767
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,039
simple inference as we have in this

768
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,520
paper you would have some more structure

769
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
inference a more structured inference

770
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,200
because part of your inference would be

771
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,080
about

772
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
what's just in front of you part of your

773
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
inference would be about your dog that's

774
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
right over there and you would have a

775
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,600
lot of

776
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
by carving your external state space

777
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,960
into different things with their own

778
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
steady state

779
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,240
you would actually have a an inference

780
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,320
that's much more structured because you

781
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,399
would infer all these things all these

782
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,600
different things that are in your

783
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
environment

784
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,799
so this can all be accommodated in this

785
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,240
paper

786
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
but then you would definitely need

787
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,799
another paper to like make that explicit

788
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,679
and

789
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
and say some really interesting things

790
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,320
because yeah this is really um the way

791
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,880
to go but the the mathematics doesn't

792
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
need doesn't need extension it's just

793
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,559
like um

794
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
yeah it would just be like partition the

795
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
state space and then yeah we can have

796
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,919
all that that you spoke about

797
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,279
thank you

798
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
great and also one piece so then

799
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
stephen's question is it's it's not as

800
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
if something being ergodic or not is

801
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,919
equivalent to it being easy or simple or

802
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,600
tractable like looking at these

803
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,240
distributions um or trajectories here

804
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,919
the one that you characterized as

805
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,360
non-ergotic not sampling um basically

806
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
across the state space the bottom right

807
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,279
this one

808
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,320
is the one that in the caption it says

809
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,399
purely conservative dynamics lower right

810
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,840
panel are reminiscent of the

811
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
trajectories of massive bodies whose

812
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,640
random fluctuations are negligible

813
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
so it's actually not like it's um maybe

814
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
this will speak to steven's questions

815
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,080
about what is a thorn and and what's a

816
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,120
rose

817
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,679
because this is a non-ergotic system

818
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,480
that's

819
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,320
massively predictable

820
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
you can do it with a you know a gear

821
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,840
so

822
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
maybe that relates to

823
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,840
some of these criticisms about well

824
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,679
we're only working with a limited set of

825
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,520
ergotic processes it's like okay but

826
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
that's the squiggly one that's dancing

827
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,799
everywhere the stochastic process that

828
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,279
we care about whereas including

829
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
non-ergotic processes some of these

830
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
non-organic processes might just be

831
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,279
going around in an oval so it won't be a

832
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,720
challenge for the math at all something

833
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
that works on the stochastic squiggle is

834
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,120
going to have actually an easier time on

835
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,440
this oval one so

836
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
stephen and then anyone else with a

837
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
question

838
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,880
yeah thanks um

839
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,320
yeah i suppose actually tying into what

840
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,399
you just said there daniel the

841
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,799
that there's this question with um

842
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
how much we

843
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,039
need to be able to sample over big state

844
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
spaces so it might well be that i don't

845
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,880
know the chemicals of a cell there

846
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,279
with molecules vibrating

847
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,919
millions of times a second and

848
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,399
there may be a you know a quick

849
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,960
ongoing way to sort of get a feel for

850
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
the ergodic state space

851
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
now if you watch a

852
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
cricket ball come towards you

853
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
um

854
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
you know you don't get that chance to do

855
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,279
that so but you might want to sort of

856
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,200
maintain a trajec some sort of

857
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
trajectory

858
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
um that can still be um

859
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,799
tractable i suppose so

860
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,640
i think this is this is actually quite

861
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
quite useful

862
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,640
um i suppose the question then comes in

863
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,440
is

864
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
how what's the sort of in-betweens you

865
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,799
know where does

866
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,679
um approximation science come in more

867
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,640
and more

868
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
to allow us to sort of

869
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
work with not knowing

870
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,240
um and work with something like um these

871
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,399
solenoidal flows

872
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,600
um

873
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,399
in a more fuzzy way um

874
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
because i am assuming that if you've got

875
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,320
less chances to sample your state space

876
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,880
solenoidal might be

877
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
more useful

878
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
to get towards something tractable or

879
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,240
maybe i'm wrong but i wonder what your

880
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
thoughts are on that

881
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,200
right um so actually solenoidal um

882
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
i mean so

883
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,519
in in this figure here uh on the bottom

884
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,519
left you have like

885
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,080
no solenoidal flow and then the bottom

886
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,399
right there's just so the node or flow

887
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
um so i would say

888
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,200
all of these two like very special cases

889
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
uh they don't look like biological

890
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,799
systems at all

891
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,360
and they're also the the simplest ones

892
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
to to understand mathematically and to

893
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
study mathematically

894
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
and actually when it gets really

895
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
interesting and when it looks a lot more

896
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,200
like a biological system is on the top

897
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
left

898
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,559
and that's harder to

899
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,120
to assess mathematically um

900
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,039
and so as you can see it's quite i mean

901
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,960
i think the dynamic on the top left is

902
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,559
quite nice because on the one hand you

903
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
have dissipation like you have some

904
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,039
squiggly lines you have randomness

905
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,799
on the other hand thanks to the

906
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,640
solenoidal flow you have some kind of

907
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,159
exploration

908
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,720
and also some kind of like circular

909
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,159
patterns so for example in um

910
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,840
and this is actually how how you correct

911
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
there is what's called a non-equilibrium

912
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
steady state but without without going

913
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,679
into the details

914
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,880
um as humans as and as animals we have a

915
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,120
lot of circular patterns they are not

916
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,279
purely deterministic so for example we

917
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,919
all have a circadian rhythm

918
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,519
um and we all have all sorts of other um

919
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,919
yeah circular patterns and i think

920
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,919
yeah to account for that uh you really

921
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,399
need to be to be on the top left

922
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,020
um so i think the

923
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,200
[Music]

924
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
i mean one of the next steps to this

925
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,600
research is

926
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,919
right right now we just assumed that the

927
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,559
dynamic is stationary and so all this

928
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
applies to like a humongous

929
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,919
range of dynamics and a lot of them

930
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,840
don't look like biological systems at

931
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,960
all

932
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
and i think the next step would be to

933
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
to restrict ourselves to dynamics that

934
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,440
look a lot more like that like

935
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,519
biological systems

936
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,399
and then see what what else can we say

937
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,559
and and i bet there's some dynamics that

938
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,440
look a lot like very intelligent systems

939
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,840
and some that also look like maybe

940
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
lifelike systems but they are not so

941
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
intelligent so the question is what kind

942
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
of parameters what kind of dynamics do

943
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,120
you need

944
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,279
um to characterize something that

945
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,440
explores its environment uh something

946
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,279
that makes decisions and all sorts of

947
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,720
things

948
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
um

949
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
yeah

950
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,399
and and that's going to be a challenge

951
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,679
and also

952
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,600
i mean just speaking about biological

953
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,919
systems i think biological systems have

954
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,559
a lot of solenoidal flow and they do

955
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,320
have dissipation but they don't have so

956
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
much dissipation

957
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,320
so you would have something like the top

958
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,880
left but with like huge

959
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
you have huge like a lot of expiration

960
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
like you would go a lot further than

961
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,760
that in your state space

962
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,839
and then you would have a bit of i mean

963
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,599
you would have a lot of squiggly lines

964
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,040
but

965
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,800
it would be yeah there would be a lot

966
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
more like exploration than there is

967
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,000
dissipation

968
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,520
yes stephen go forward

969
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,359
yeah and and

970
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,440
you have both can combine can't so

971
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,560
gradient

972
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,960
sin and solenoidal flow can kind of

973
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
be playing at the same time i'm

974
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,639
wondering if someone was to bring

975
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,918
attention to a goal or a type of

976
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,239
attention maybe more pragmatic attention

977
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,599
or an epistemic attention or a risk

978
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,440
adverse attention

979
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,719
whether

980
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
it might be that rather than trying to

981
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
deal with the whole state space maybe

982
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,359
that that general

983
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,040
process carries on but in it tries to

984
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
introduce a solenoidal

985
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,639
you know um type of flow which in some

986
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,119
ways you could imagine being more

987
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,280
tractable to a biological system if it's

988
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,920
like bioelectricity

989
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,400
um there's you know the types of

990
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,760
dynamics which may be are more

991
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
tractable around a certain trajectory um

992
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,000
than some

993
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
um so you've the these the these

994
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
dynamics could combine

995
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,520
um

996
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,720
in different regimes of attention

997
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,839
yeah

998
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,760
yeah definitely um

999
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,920
and i think but i think to to properly

1000
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,160
account for attention we we need to go

1001
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,960
beyond these continuous state spaces

1002
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,280
and do what people um

1003
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,119
um and basically extend to these

1004
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,119
standard models of active inference

1005
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,960
where in in addition to have some

1006
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
continuous state space maybe like for

1007
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
movements and this kind of thing you

1008
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,040
also have a discrete state space

1009
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,640
and then you would have a dynamic

1010
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,480
evolving in your discrete state space

1011
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,680
and maybe like

1012
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000
some state would be oh i'm attending

1013
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,760
over there and some other state would be

1014
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
unattending over there so i think

1015
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,440
attention is really something

1016
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,680
um that can be modeled

1017
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
with a discrete state space

1018
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,800
um

1019
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
and then it would

1020
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,160
i don't think it would be so hard and i

1021
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
mean at least seems doable to extend all

1022
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,680
the math here to like models

1023
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,920
uh yeah that have some like continuous

1024
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,480
state space maybe for movement or

1025
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
or

1026
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,760
or other kinds of things like maybe like

1027
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
blood glucose concentration is also

1028
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
something that evolves on a continuous

1029
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
scale there's also a lot of a lot of

1030
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,119
things in our mind that are discrete so

1031
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,359
is this red yes or no

1032
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
is it raining yes or no

1033
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,760
and to account for all that we need uh

1034
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,040
we need a discrete state space as well

1035
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,480
awesome thank you lance welcome scott i

1036
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,720
see your hand raised so go for the

1037
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
question and then anyone else with a

1038
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
raised hand

1039
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
thank you i came in a little late um my

1040
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,440
apologies is fascinating the solenoidal

1041
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
flow when that gets set up

1042
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,119
is it possible that he had multiple

1043
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,280
state spaces and

1044
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,079
might because of the solenoidal flow

1045
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,119
might it have a periodicity in each of

1046
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,359
the state spaces so that you might be

1047
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,079
able to use fourier transforms to unpack

1048
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,160
multiple state spaces in a biological

1049
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,200
system

1050
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,320
so could you use

1051
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
having that periodicity does that allow

1052
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,280
for a fourier type analysis to start to

1053
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
unpack state spaces potentially when you

1054
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,320
have multiple state spaces and you're

1055
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
trying to distinguish them

1056
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,400
yeah that's a that's a really good point

1057
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
so i know um

1058
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,920
i know a paper actually that that

1059
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
analyzes the solenoidal flow in terms of

1060
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,839
the fourier transform

1061
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,160
um i haven't really really thought about

1062
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,520
it i think i mean if if you get rid of

1063
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
the dissipative part so if you get rid

1064
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
of the squiggly lines and you're just in

1065
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
the bottom right

1066
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,320
then you can definitely use fourier

1067
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
transforms

1068
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
but then also the dynamic on the bottom

1069
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,760
right is not is not representative of

1070
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
biological systems

1071
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,560
um

1072
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
so then what you can do when you're on

1073
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
the top left which is really the

1074
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,760
interesting case

1075
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,480
is analyze the time irreversible part so

1076
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
the solenoid will flow with the fourier

1077
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,160
transform

1078
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
and then so you so you do this hem holes

1079
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,599
decomposition that we're talking about

1080
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,040
in the appendix

1081
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,320
uh you decompose your dynamic into

1082
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,040
yeah so it's the equation a2

1083
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,839
um

1084
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,119
yeah yeah perfect so you decompose your

1085
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,920
uh your drift b so so b is the direction

1086
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,320
in which your dynamic is moving um on

1087
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,880
average into reversible and irreversible

1088
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,119
parts the irreversible part is the

1089
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,599
solenoid overflow which you can analyze

1090
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,760
using fourier transform

1091
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
but then you need to like figure out how

1092
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
to accommodate the reversible part with

1093
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,520
it

1094
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,640
so i can share i can share the paper

1095
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
um

1096
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,119
if you're interested but yeah it seems

1097
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,280
like like they're they're able to to

1098
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
like do do some things with that

1099
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,960
technique uh but it's also pretty pretty

1100
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,359
involved to be honest

1101
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,599
a question on the time reversible and

1102
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,359
irreversible

1103
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,839
what does that mean and in a world where

1104
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,599
it seems like we're moving forward

1105
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,119
through time only what exactly does that

1106
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,480
mean that there's something that's

1107
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,960
invariant under time reversible

1108
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
versus something that changes sign under

1109
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,280
time reversal like if we can't

1110
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
get the time machine or put the process

1111
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
in a time machine why does it matter

1112
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
that it's time reversible or how does

1113
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,720
that fall out of the equations

1114
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,640
right um

1115
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
well yeah so so

1116
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,640
all this is really to emphasize that

1117
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,200
we're not assuming the dynamic to be

1118
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,800
time reversible

1119
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
and and as you say everything in the

1120
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
world around us i mean most things are

1121
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,119
time irreversible so

1122
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,000
the

1123
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,160
uh if you go back to the to the figure

1124
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,720
just below so the movement of planets is

1125
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
really something that's irreversible i

1126
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,119
mean the the earth turns around the sun

1127
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,200
in one direction and if you are to

1128
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
rewind time

1129
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
it will turn around the sun in the other

1130
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,839
direction so that

1131
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,599
so in this case you can really tell the

1132
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,880
difference between

1133
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,800
time as time goes forward and as time

1134
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
goes backward and that's really what's

1135
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,359
meant by time irreversible

1136
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,839
um but now if you look like a other cup

1137
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,040
of coffee

1138
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
and the coffee is still

1139
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
um the the

1140
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,000
molecules the

1141
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,319
coffee molecules or whatever molecules

1142
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,319
you have in that cup they're still

1143
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,560
bouncing with each other

1144
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
and that's that's something that's time

1145
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
reversible because if you look at the

1146
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,160
cup of coffee um if you if i give you a

1147
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,599
movie of the cup of coffee sitting still

1148
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,920
you can watch the movie uh as time goes

1149
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,680
forward or backward and uh and you

1150
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
wouldn't be able to tell the difference

1151
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
so that's something that's reversible

1152
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,599
and so as you can see from this example

1153
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,440
actually things that are reversible

1154
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
aren't interesting at all

1155
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,079
from at least a biological perspective

1156
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,240
and there's a there's so much literature

1157
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,599
about

1158
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,880
um yeah about one of the

1159
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,040
uh i mean one of the fundamental things

1160
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,640
of being alive

1161
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,880
is being time irreversible

1162
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,200
it's about like eating and producing

1163
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
waste um it's about yeah consuming

1164
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,200
energy

1165
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
all that kind of thing all that kind of

1166
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
stuff um produces entropy and is time

1167
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,160
irreversible

1168
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,560
um but then time so time irreversibility

1169
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
it's something that's necessary to be

1170
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,520
alive

1171
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,760
but it's not it's not sufficient

1172
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,960
um so for example if i give you

1173
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,400
um a convection cell

1174
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
though that would be time irreversible

1175
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
but it won't it won't be alive

1176
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,800
so any any kind of cycle that's more or

1177
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,680
less periodic um so maybe if you if you

1178
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,280
see like a cyclone

1179
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,200
a cyclone is time irreversible because

1180
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,480
it's like

1181
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,319
spinning one way and not the other so if

1182
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,839
you run out of time it would be spinning

1183
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
the other way

1184
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,720
so it's different so it's time

1185
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,160
irreversible but that's not alive

1186
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,920
um and so

1187
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,599
there's many

1188
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,160
many things like that time

1189
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,280
irreversibility um

1190
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,040
yeah creation of entropy

1191
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,480
there's a few things like that that

1192
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
characterize biological systems

1193
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,440
and i think as we as we go on with this

1194
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,920
work we'll we'll try to like specialize

1195
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
to only those dynamics that

1196
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,319
satisfy all these requirements and

1197
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,640
eventually things like oh we need

1198
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,480
systems that are able to reproduce for

1199
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,880
example like a marker blanket that is

1200
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,599
able to divide into two markup blankets

1201
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,040
for example when a when a cell

1202
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
decomposes into

1203
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,119
into two cells so

1204
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,920
so this is really the beginning and

1205
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
and yeah in the next years i think this

1206
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
community is really

1207
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,000
going to be able to

1208
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,920
to like address all these challenges and

1209
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,960
like

1210
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,160
um

1211
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,000
all these characterizations of living

1212
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,720
systems to to gradually evolve towards

1213
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,480
models that are

1214
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,520
yeah more realistic i would say

1215
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,480
awesome

1216
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,440
so

1217
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
i'll have more to say on it but scott go

1218
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,200
for it

1219
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
so a couple of things there's a book

1220
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
called life's ratchet which is kind of

1221
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,440
interesting just on that um the idea of

1222
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
that irreversibility and that value of

1223
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,839
that the idea is that life kind of

1224
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,560
ratchets in these forms that work with

1225
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
the externality i haven't revisited that

1226
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,920
since i've been exposed to active

1227
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,359
inference but it might be interesting to

1228
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,720
take another look at life's ratchet also

1229
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,079
one of the things i

1230
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,319
like that discussion of living forms and

1231
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,720
what's necessary uh prerequisites to

1232
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,319
living forms one of the working

1233
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,079
definitions i'll share that i'm using

1234
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:36,960
now

1235
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
and i think let me tell you why i'm

1236
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
using it is um that life is auto

1237
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,200
catalytic

1238
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,440
and entropy secreting

1239
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
now my kids claim the i just wanted to

1240
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,440
say secretion in my definition because

1241
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,119
it's gushy that was my my kids used to

1242
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,800
say but um

1243
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,880
auto catalytic and entropy secreting so

1244
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,480
notice i didn't say it had to be

1245
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,880
embodied in a specific form or specific

1246
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,839
matrix or context it could be a market

1247
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,520
it could be a markov you know a lot of

1248
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
different things so um

1249
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,599
so the reason i share that here it's

1250
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
interesting because active inference we

1251
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
have this definition of life like

1252
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,560
corollas linnaeus you look at it you see

1253
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,079
if it has feathers and you see if it has

1254
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,000
blood and stuff like that but now we're

1255
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
going towards mathematical definitions

1256
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,280
of living things

1257
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,960
and that's going to be very interesting

1258
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
because i think what when we have a

1259
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,400
working definition that works for

1260
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,280
biologic forms so again my working

1261
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,359
definition right now is auto catalytic

1262
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,040
and entropy secreting

1263
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,599
um then i can start to say okay

1264
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,680
if that works for biologic forms let's

1265
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,200
say that did work and maybe there's

1266
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,040
problems with whatever but if it works

1267
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,319
then you can start saying okay what

1268
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,319
other systems happen to be auto

1269
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,560
catalytic and entropy secreting and

1270
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,680
therefore we shall now call living

1271
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,319
and maybe we can start to look at them

1272
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,680
and make observations about those

1273
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
systems and what i'm thinking about i'm

1274
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,680
a guy who's a lawyer and in finance for

1275
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
years so i'm looking at this and saying

1276
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,119
okay you look at these systems

1277
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,720
biological systems came up with these

1278
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,480
markets and these other

1279
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,160
systems that we have to do things in the

1280
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,480
world maybe these systems are

1281
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,920
describable with biological framings and

1282
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,760
so that's why the kind of work you're

1283
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
doing feels like it as it starts to

1284
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
reveal some more general definitions of

1285
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,280
living forms taking those definitions

1286
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,200
and then reapplying them back out into

1287
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
the world and saying okay

1288
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,359
are there living forms that have escaped

1289
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,720
our detection as living forms and

1290
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,640
basically are they is there scale

1291
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,079
independence are there fractal elements

1292
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,280
what are the things that we can now

1293
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
describe in those things that we

1294
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,400
previously had not thought of as biology

1295
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,319
but in fact are describable as biology

1296
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,760
that's very exciting to me so i just

1297
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,119
wanted to say that the kind of things

1298
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,040
you were describing there and that kind

1299
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
of working way back down into a model of

1300
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,319
life based on time irreversibility it's

1301
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,480
very interesting i think thanks and very

1302
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,839
interesting paper overall i'm looking

1303
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,359
forward to

1304
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,040
diving into this and the other that

1305
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,560
other paper you were mentioning also

1306
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,880
thank you cool yeah

1307
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,560
yeah thanks a lot that that's really

1308
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,920
great

1309
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,000
so to tie this

1310
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,319
from the some of the physical examples

1311
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,760
we've been talking about like the

1312
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
diffusion processes

1313
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,040
to the

1314
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,880
physics of information and information

1315
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,319
flows

1316
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,079
the big thing we've been talking about

1317
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
is this statistical

1318
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,560
physics and this bayesian mechanics

1319
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,880
and we heard a little bit earlier how we

1320
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,640
could talk about the moments like the

1321
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,200
first moment the simplest form the a

1322
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,599
posteriori estimation was the mean and

1323
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,359
then the second moment of a statistical

1324
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,960
distribution is the variance and there's

1325
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
also higher statistical moments that

1326
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,160
describe higher and higher aspects of an

1327
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,400
informational distribution

1328
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,359
there's also the concept in physics of

1329
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,760
moments like the position and the

1330
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,319
velocity in higher and higher physical

1331
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,280
moments

1332
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,400
and so the mapping is that potentially

1333
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,480
these physical moments that would

1334
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,440
describe components of a physical flow

1335
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
that could also be decomposed using the

1336
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,480
helmholtz decomposition might also apply

1337
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,839
to some of these

1338
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,440
informational

1339
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,119
flows and decompositions so we could

1340
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,079
use those analogies like the the coffee

1341
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,760
mixing and the steady state of the

1342
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,720
coffee and then think about how a

1343
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,040
statistical distribution is playing by

1344
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,400
similar rules

1345
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,640
and so it's also interesting scott about

1346
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,680
instead of going from the um non-living

1347
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,280
systems and then looking for that

1348
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,200
pattern and pattern matching to

1349
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,160
biological systems we can kind of start

1350
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,559
up on the top left with or something

1351
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,119
even more biologically fleshed out and

1352
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,520
then look for those patterns and pattern

1353
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,319
match

1354
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,000
outside of systems that have you know a

1355
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,640
vertebra and a central nervous system

1356
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,040
because that shouldn't be the um

1357
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,280
the card to get into the club of

1358
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,839
information processing systems

1359
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,400
or entropy secreting systems so

1360
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,520
any thoughts lance

1361
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,160
[Music]

1362
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,680
yeah i mean

1363
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,440
yeah i think i think that's that's

1364
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,720
really interesting um

1365
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,000
i mean the the the real challenge here

1366
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,240
is to is to make the link between the

1367
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,720
physics and the information

1368
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,760
and

1369
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,000
the the more i've been working on this

1370
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
the more i realized that actually a lot

1371
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,240
of a lot of physics or at least a lot of

1372
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,960
statistical physics you can

1373
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,240
um you can explain with properties of of

1374
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,359
information

1375
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,200
so for example

1376
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,760
entropy increasing is also

1377
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,160
information being lost

1378
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,960
um

1379
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,160
not not

1380
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
stochasticity

1381
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,119
stochasticity so the inability to

1382
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,000
predict the future exactly and

1383
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,480
it is exactly the same as

1384
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,000
entropy being lost over time

1385
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,599
information being lost over time and

1386
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,240
entropy entropy increasing

1387
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
so i think there's um

1388
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,720
there's very deep connections between um

1389
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,359
yeah information physics

1390
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,359
uh inference

1391
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,079
and uh so some of them have been fleshed

1392
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
out but not

1393
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,240
i mean it hasn't it hasn't really been

1394
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
put together at least as far as i know

1395
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,960
in this context in the context of markov

1396
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,240
blankets

1397
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,040
in the context of how how can we

1398
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
like have a theory of how adaptive

1399
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
systems work

1400
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,559
and

1401
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,559
can we describe adaptive systems as

1402
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,640
performing imprints

1403
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,040
um so so i think this is this is really

1404
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,160
exciting

1405
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,920
and and also as you can see from this

1406
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,520
paper so the

1407
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,119
the dynamics that we're considering

1408
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,599
there they're extremely general

1409
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,480
and for these dynamics for all of them

1410
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,160
were able to derive some kind of

1411
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,359
inference so this is to say that this uh

1412
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,599
inferential description

1413
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,319
is it applies to many systems

1414
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,720
and so it means that on the one hand

1415
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,119
it's very ubiquitous but then on the

1416
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,040
other hand it's not it's not that useful

1417
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,079
because

1418
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,280
um

1419
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,200
maybe like uh the things that didn't

1420
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,079
look at all like biological systems

1421
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,400
can still can still satisfy this kind of

1422
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
uh free energy principle or bayesian

1423
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,839
mechanics

1424
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,319
so so i think what's really exciting is

1425
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,359
to

1426
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,200
to be able to

1427
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,920
um in in the future to to like

1428
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,599
specialize to those dynamics that look

1429
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,440
more like biological systems and then

1430
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
really look at these informational

1431
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,559
properties

1432
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,640
and i think a big one is

1433
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,119
how much exploration do we have

1434
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,880
and exploration is really something

1435
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
exploration and curiosity it's really

1436
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,880
something that characterizes uh

1437
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,520
intelligent systems as we know it

1438
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,200
and um

1439
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,359
and yeah so there's some discussions in

1440
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,200
in the literature of how we would be

1441
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
able to use things like uh

1442
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,440
information length and concepts for

1443
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,119
information theory and information

1444
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,640
geometry to quantify things like memory

1445
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,480
and itinerancy curiosity and so on

1446
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,839
so one question from the live chat

1447
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,559
before you continue the question is what

1448
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,040
is the explicit definition of

1449
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,839
information flow and also maybe in that

1450
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,440
if you want to describe a little bit

1451
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,960
about this other

1452
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,599
paper like what is information flow

1453
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,119
what is information geometry and how

1454
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,319
does it relate to what we're talking

1455
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,599
about here

1456
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,200
right um so so this

1457
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,879
this is all the idea of um

1458
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,480
as as an organism you're always encoding

1459
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,880
some beliefs about your environment so

1460
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,359
we talked about maximum posteriori and

1461
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,920
variational inference

1462
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,400
so the idea is that we're always

1463
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
receiving sensations and then making

1464
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,119
some inferences about the outside

1465
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,960
now if you're making some inferences

1466
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,040
about the outside

1467
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,359
implicitly or mathematically you're

1468
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,000
parameterizing a distribution

1469
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,200
about things in the in the environment

1470
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,240
and so information geometry uh then

1471
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,960
comes into play uh information geometry

1472
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,520
quantifies the extent to which beliefs

1473
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,440
about the environment are different from

1474
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,800
each other

1475
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,079
um

1476
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,760
so it doesn't it doesn't make sense so

1477
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,119
for example

1478
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,400
let's say that um

1479
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,040
let's say that um

1480
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,240
i think uh daniel's um

1481
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,920
yeah uh daniel's uh eyes are blue

1482
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,520
let's let's just say

1483
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,480
um

1484
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,559
and then i have some uncertainty around

1485
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,240
the real color

1486
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,640
um so that would be like one

1487
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,280
one kind of uh belief i could hold and

1488
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,200
then another type of belief would be

1489
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,760
daniel's eyes

1490
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,839
um

1491
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
are brown and then i would have some

1492
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,680
other kind of uncertainty

1493
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,000
now the way um

1494
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,079
now a question you could ask me is how

1495
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,359
different are these two beliefs

1496
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,079
um and if you have a if i had a

1497
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,000
different belief about the color of his

1498
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,119
eyes

1499
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,520
would that believe be more different

1500
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,240
than the beliefs i initially had

1501
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,160
um so then information

1502
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,839
geometry enables you to answer these

1503
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,079
questions it enables you to say how how

1504
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,680
two beliefs are different from each

1505
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,640
other

1506
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,720
uh by quantifying the distance between

1507
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,839
them

1508
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,960
but also even more interestingly

1509
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,319
as i

1510
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,280
um let's say i i've never met daniel

1511
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,599
before let's say i haven't seen his

1512
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,359
picture before now you give me a picture

1513
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,640
of daniel

1514
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,720
um i'm gonna make an inference about the

1515
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,280
color of his eyes so from being

1516
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,240
initially completely agnostic

1517
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,400
i'm going to move my completely agnostic

1518
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,800
belief to a belief that says oh maybe he

1519
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,680
has

1520
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,520
brown eyes

1521
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,319
so this is to say that as we make

1522
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,400
inferences and sample the world our

1523
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,200
beliefs evolve and so information

1524
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,480
geometry enables you to say um how it

1525
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,160
enables you to quantify how much your

1526
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,880
beliefs evolved evolved and what kind of

1527
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,839
trajectory did they take

1528
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,400
because i i mean i'm assuming at least

1529
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,480
our beliefs uh they they evolve in a

1530
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,000
continuous manner

1531
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,079
as we sample more information

1532
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,160
and then it becomes interesting to see

1533
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,240
uh what kind of trajectories did my

1534
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,480
beliefs take and was that was that

1535
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,359
trajectory efficient uh if it wasn't

1536
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,319
efficient maybe um i lost some energy

1537
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,760
there that i could have used somewhere

1538
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,640
else

1539
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,839
so so

1540
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,160
my my inference wasn't very optimal from

1541
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,920
that perspective

1542
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,119
and then so there's a paper about this

1543
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,520
actually uh on active inference that

1544
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,839
uses information geometry to to see how

1545
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,799
how um whether inferences in active

1546
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,880
inference are efficient from a metabolic

1547
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,960
point of view so something that you can

1548
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,720
look at with information geometry

1549
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,240
thanks just to follow up from the chat

1550
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,079
and then we'll return to our colleagues

1551
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,000
here do we have

1552
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,240
um or more precisely do we hope to have

1553
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,720
a definition like an electromagnetic

1554
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,839
flux in field theory

1555
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,920
for information flows information flux

1556
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,319
yes um

1557
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,680
yes so so information flux is the

1558
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,160
the movement of beliefs

1559
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,839
and so you can

1560
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,400
you can write that down mathematically

1561
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,680
um

1562
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
so so yeah i mean

1563
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,920
a belief is a probability distribution

1564
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,520
about things that are going on in the

1565
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,799
environment

1566
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,880
and as you sample information you would

1567
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,720
change probability distribution so it'd

1568
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,160
be like a motion

1569
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,440
on the space of probability

1570
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,760
distributions that's really the the

1571
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,240
meaning of information flow but maybe

1572
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,280
the question was about um can we derive

1573
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,119
some kind of like maxwell's equation

1574
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,720
some kind of law

1575
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,119
about how um

1576
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,280
about how information flow happens like

1577
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,079
maybe an equation for information flow

1578
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,400
and i would say that that's what we

1579
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,240
that that would be the aim uh that would

1580
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
be what what people are working towards

1581
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,000
in theoretical neuroscience like some

1582
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,359
kind of equation

1583
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,000
that explains how we make inference

1584
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,960
awesome

1585
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,079
so a few raised hands scott first then

1586
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,480
blue then stephen so go ahead scott a

1587
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,319
couple of things that was fascinating

1588
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,599
little bits there um so on that last

1589
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,200
piece on the information for those two

1590
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,680
points um the embodiment i'm thinking of

1591
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,440
embodiment of information so i'm

1592
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,599
thinking of a farmer that's deciding

1593
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,920
what crops to plant so they look and

1594
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,839
they get information from the newspaper

1595
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,520
and they look at weather reports and

1596
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,839
they gather information then they decide

1597
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,920
on what seeds to plant the seed itself

1598
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
is an embodiment of information they put

1599
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,160
the seed in the ground they get results

1600
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,240
with their farming the markets then

1601
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,000
respond so there was there were seeds as

1602
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,520
information farmers processing

1603
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,960
information markets processing

1604
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,480
information and one of the things that's

1605
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,319
kind of interesting here it's a lot of

1606
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,160
the work i'm doing now is in food chains

1607
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,520
and trying to figure out how to de-risk

1608
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,400
food chains and and just food generally

1609
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,280
and

1610
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,599
that efficiency question you just asked

1611
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,359
is really interesting what are the

1612
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,920
losses and conversions that happen when

1613
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,520
information is embodied in those

1614
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,160
different aspects of that decision

1615
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,640
process through which something gets

1616
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,280
converted from a need of society to have

1617
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,359
a certain amount of corn at a certain

1618
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,480
time of year

1619
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,880
to through all those chains of seeds and

1620
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,200
selections and farmers and processing

1621
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,559
all those things it's kind of

1622
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,000
interesting to look at the system as

1623
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,640
both each piece of it is living the seed

1624
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,319
is arguably living although there's a

1625
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,520
question of where the seeds are living

1626
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,400
among

1627
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,440
people who are biologists but anyway

1628
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,119
and then uh because they're not actively

1629
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,720
doing stuff but the they're kind of

1630
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,760
stasis but um anyway that embodiment

1631
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,839
question is that's one and let me ask

1632
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,240
i'll ask both and then turn off my voice

1633
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,160
here so the embodiment question is one

1634
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,920
kind of that notion you just talked

1635
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,440
about about an overall formula maybe

1636
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,040
there's an overall embodiment

1637
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,880
characterization that's made possible

1638
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,640
using those landscapes and looking at

1639
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,640
kind of a multi-faceted landscape and

1640
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,640
looking at those conversions that happen

1641
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,480
from one embodiment of information to

1642
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,160
another and efficiencies there that's an

1643
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,839
interesting kind of possible thought the

1644
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,920
other one is you said something about

1645
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,079
curiosity before maximum exploration

1646
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,760
maximum curiosity

1647
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,839
that really struck me because one of the

1648
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,680
things we've been advocating for i do

1649
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,280
did a lot of cyber work a number of

1650
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,200
years ago and people were coming out of

1651
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,680
the military and we were saying oh hey

1652
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,520
you ex-military guy you got to learn

1653
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,280
more critical thinking and that was kind

1654
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,880
of insulting because they were senior

1655
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,400
people right they're like hey we can

1656
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,920
work pretty quickly but really they

1657
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,760
didn't and one of the things i started

1658
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,440
saying is don't tell people they have to

1659
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,480
have critical thinking that's not

1660
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,920
consulting how they have to be more

1661
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,599
curious

1662
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,880
and it's kind of interesting that we're

1663
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,720
getting now to these systems having a

1664
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,079
maximum

1665
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,640
exploration possibility a maximum

1666
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,680
efficiency in some ways with curiosity

1667
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,319
to me that really informs a lot of

1668
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,240
teaching because if you have people who

1669
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,720
develop a curiosity over their lifetime

1670
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,960
they take care of being educated they

1671
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,760
continuously are learning and so that

1672
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,359
notion of exploration and curiosity

1673
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,839
seems like it could fundamentally

1674
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,760
through active inference

1675
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,040
affect how we do teaching and much less

1676
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,119
of rote teaching and much more of a

1677
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,680
curiosity based teaching because of the

1678
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,960
power you'll never know what you're

1679
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,160
going to encounter out there in the

1680
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,200
world and so telling your children hey

1681
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,079
be curious will intrinsically serve them

1682
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,359
versus teaching them a rote series of

1683
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,520
things to respond to their environment

1684
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,880
so just a couple of comments on those

1685
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,839
last two things i thought were

1686
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,079
fascinating thank you

1687
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,880
yeah that that's really interesting um

1688
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,760
so as you said and i think we all agree

1689
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,799
i mean

1690
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,720
information um

1691
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,160
or maybe 70 70 years ago or 80 years ago

1692
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,920
we didn't have any kind of information

1693
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,640
theory information theory wasn't a thing

1694
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,559
computers weren't the thing and we

1695
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,319
didn't really think about information

1696
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,480
even though it was there in books i mean

1697
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,799
i mean everywhere around us and i think

1698
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,760
with the

1699
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,079
advent of computers and information

1700
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,119
theory

1701
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,400
um

1702
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,559
just information became a big thing and

1703
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,319
people realized that it was important

1704
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,359
and

1705
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,200
now everyone

1706
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,880
thinks about everything in terms of

1707
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,119
information and and i think that's the

1708
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,480
the right way to

1709
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,680
to look at things i mean it seems to be

1710
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,160
um yeah information can encode just

1711
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,680
about anything by

1712
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,200
by definition

1713
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,119
um and so physics uh or at least our

1714
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,520
descriptions of the world they're

1715
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,440
they um

1716
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,839
matter was the most important thing

1717
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,280
matter and and waves uh this is how

1718
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,040
it all started

1719
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,359
and then um

1720
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,119
and then information geometry and

1721
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,359
information theory came into play and

1722
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,119
people started looking at these things

1723
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,920
in terms of uh information as well

1724
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,559
but i think mata uh remained the big

1725
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,359
thing

1726
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,240
um

1727
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,240
but more and more people are looking at

1728
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,599
at information in terms of like the

1729
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,000
the most important concept at least the

1730
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,640
the root concept from which uh from

1731
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,680
which you can like encode or explain

1732
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,440
everything else

1733
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,110
and um

1734
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,200
[Music]

1735
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
so so yeah information geometry came

1736
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,799
around and it enables you to to see how

1737
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,599
how information is flowing over time and

1738
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,000
how that relates to heat and

1739
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,680
things like that

1740
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,680
and now

1741
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,839
people are looking at how information

1742
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,480
may be encoded by things about other

1743
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,440
things

1744
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,920
and this is really basic mechanics based

1745
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,280
in mechanics the the root of the word is

1746
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,640
beliefs about things that are held

1747
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,440
uh that are held by other things

1748
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,400
and i think this is um

1749
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,480
yeah i mean basic mechanics

1750
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,720
i guess started out i mean in a way it

1751
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,640
started out long ago with like basic

1752
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,000
imprints

1753
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,039
um

1754
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,440
but but uh bayesian inference started

1755
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,400
out as a as an abstract uh statistical

1756
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,079
concept and now people are trying to

1757
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,559
relate that to to physics

1758
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,319
um

1759
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,160
and yeah so so i think we're moving

1760
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,559
towards the physics that's information

1761
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,319
based and

1762
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,640
uh and based about uh yeah based about

1763
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,400
beliefs about things

1764
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,160
encoded about other things so this is

1765
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,319
really basic mechanics information

1766
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,000
geometry

1767
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,799
um

1768
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,640
and then what you said about curiosity

1769
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,280
was also really interesting

1770
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,240
and

1771
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,359
so so yeah definitely i mean in ai uh

1772
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,079
people are tuning curiosity so

1773
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,480
um yeah they're trying to optimize

1774
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,799
curiosity of agents with respect to

1775
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,960
different environments

1776
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,359
in uh in a paper that we have

1777
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,680
called active entrance on discrete state

1778
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,760
space is a synthesis

1779
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,119
we uh in in one of the appendices we we

1780
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,359
justify the expected free energy

1781
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,760
objective that people use for uh to

1782
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
explain decision making in

1783
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,440
biological agents

1784
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,480
and we actually show that

1785
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,559
we could have so the expected free

1786
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,359
energy for for those who don't know

1787
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,000
is basically ways exploration and

1788
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,160
exploitation so exploration is really

1789
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,079
the curiosity

1790
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,160
so it has these two terms

1791
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,640
and in general i mean these two terms

1792
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,799
are put on the same footing

1793
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,359
but actually in the in the appendix of

1794
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,480
that

1795
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,039
active inferences synthesis paper we

1796
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,240
show that you could um weigh them in a

1797
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,599
different way

1798
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,680
and and it would

1799
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,680
and i mean the

1800
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,760
yeah the agent would still work somehow

1801
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,680
but it will have a different behavior so

1802
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,520
you could be a lot more curious or a lot

1803
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,599
less curious

1804
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,200
and that would be really interesting to

1805
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,760
quantify in terms of like uh concepts of

1806
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,599
information geometry

1807
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,760
but so so this is to say that that you

1808
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,079
can actually tune that and have agents

1809
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,079
that have different curiosities

1810
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,799
and also make me think about

1811
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,240
what you said about things from

1812
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,480
computational psychiatry

1813
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,079
where um

1814
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,440
people explain

1815
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,200
diseases

1816
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,559
like computational diseases as um

1817
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,640
as people having like different priors

1818
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,880
in their genetic model

1819
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,000
um

1820
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,760
and seeing how that how that would

1821
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,079
affect behavior so you can

1822
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,319
explain like sub-optimal optimal and

1823
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,319
sub-optimal behavior with like the same

1824
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,880
principles just by changing the model

1825
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,599
and we also have um a recent paper on

1826
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,760
the bayesian brains and the rainy

1827
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,079
diversions where but we're basically

1828
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,480
showing that by changing

1829
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,000
doing variational inference a bit

1830
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,680
differently

1831
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,640
you can actually um account for for

1832
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,520
agents that are optimal that make like

1833
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,280
the right decisions and agents that

1834
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,440
maybe are a bit sub-optimal in terms of

1835
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,960
curiosity and

1836
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,839
and so on so i think there's a

1837
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,160
like a lot of exciting computational

1838
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,680
work to be done

1839
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,599
in terms of characterizing different

1840
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,039
behaviors

1841
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,240
and i think we're really at the

1842
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,319
beginning and ultimately all these

1843
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,240
things

1844
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,319
will be able to i mean people will be

1845
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,160
able to account for the information

1846
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,680
geometry i think that's the right

1847
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,440
framework

1848
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,960
thank you lance just quick follow-up

1849
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,039
scott go for it yep quick follow two

1850
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,480
things when the beijing mechanics when

1851
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,760
you say beliefs about things that are

1852
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,920
held by other things that feels nice

1853
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,359
with my example of the farmer and the

1854
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,319
seeds

1855
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,480
because it's an embodiment each thing

1856
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,960
that embodies something is the

1857
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,000
embodiment is a belief in a sense right

1858
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,480
because it's holding a seed doesn't have

1859
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,720
a belief itself but it's embodying

1860
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,000
information

1861
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,039
and so

1862
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,760
it's interesting to think about belief

1863
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,680
of things and then the embodiment of

1864
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,200
information in the thing intrinsic

1865
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,960
affordance that the thing offers right

1866
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,640
that is that what's the relationship

1867
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,119
between belief and intrinsic physical

1868
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,280
affordance that's in in a system that is

1869
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,200
the result of an earlier information

1870
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,720
system that's one follow-up then the

1871
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,599
second follow-up is the way i soften

1872
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,039
people up when you talk to older people

1873
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,559
and you're like oh it's all information

1874
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:07,839
it's not physical we're information

1875
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,680
beings the way i soften them up just to

1876
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,520
share is i say to them do you have a

1877
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,760
401k or retirement plan most older

1878
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,039
people are starting to think about that

1879
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,880
and then they they say yeah and i say do

1880
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,400
you think it's a pile of groceries

1881
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,280
waiting for you to retire because it's

1882
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,680
not it's just data in a system and if

1883
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,839
that system goes away you got nothing so

1884
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,039
it's that idea of getting people to

1885
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,720
understand how much we depend upon

1886
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,920
information and then people start

1887
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,079
thinking oh wow i guess i really do

1888
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,160
depend upon all sorts of other systems

1889
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,400
in my life it's a something that

1890
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,559
as physical beings it's hard for us to

1891
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,480
realize how much we are information

1892
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,000
beings and that's again just part of

1893
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
that rhetorical exercise to get people

1894
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,079
in a head space of saying wow maybe

1895
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,599
things really are information that i

1896
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,079
thought were solid like my retirement

1897
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,000
plans but really they're just totally

1898
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,599
dependent on systems and the information

1899
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,440
output of those systems thanks nice

1900
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,960
scott thank you

1901
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,599
so um blue with a question go for it

1902
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,680
so you mentioned a paper um that you

1903
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,119
well i don't know if it was your paper

1904
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,119
but about information geometry and

1905
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,200
activated friends is it this one that's

1906
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,520
markup blankets information geometry and

1907
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,760
stochastic thermodynamics is that the

1908
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,240
paper you're talking about uh no that

1909
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,799
that's not this one so here uh if you're

1910
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,280
referring to the one um

1911
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,880
yeah about how um inference is efficient

1912
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
like quantifying efficiency of inference

1913
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,039
and how much like energy

1914
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,680
um you need to do a kind of inference um

1915
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,160
so that's not this paper

1916
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,240
it's another paper called uh neural

1917
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,599
dynamics

1918
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,839
under active

1919
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:44,480
inference um something like that

1920
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,760
so i um have some questions and i don't

1921
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,920
know anything about information geometry

1922
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,359
i mean just a little tiny bit um so it's

1923
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,559
something that i'm definitely starting

1924
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,160
to get very interested in because i

1925
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,640
think that um

1926
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,920
it's gonna

1927
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,559
be maybe like the next level of where

1928
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,799
active inference goes maybe maybe i mean

1929
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,960
i just have this suspicion so when um

1930
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,960
when you have information and in an

1931
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,799
information geometry like in an

1932
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,559
information flow

1933
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,719
uh i've been reading other papers about

1934
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,759
information flow in channels right so

1935
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,759
like when you and i mean it makes sense

1936
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,600
because when you have when you know

1937
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
something about the current state i mean

1938
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,439
it's just like an inference like you

1939
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,000
your belief about the next state of the

1940
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,839
world is based on

1941
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,719
the state of the world right now right

1942
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,759
so

1943
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,120
i mean it doesn't make sense that you

1944
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
would think you know all of a sudden i'm

1945
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,759
going to be like on pluto

1946
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,080
based on my current information and so

1947
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,719
it does is information geometry or do

1948
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,198
the channels appear when you look at

1949
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,679
inference in information geometry like

1950
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,880
does it appear to be like a trajectory

1951
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,319
um

1952
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,960
that's a good that's a good question

1953
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,520
so i think i think information geometry

1954
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,920
is is more general like you don't need

1955
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,000
to have a channel it's it's really about

1956
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,439
um

1957
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,960
at the heart of it it's really about

1958
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,158
having different probability

1959
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,158
distributions and these are actually

1960
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,080
beliefs about stuff

1961
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,319
and looking how they differ from each

1962
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,399
other and like movement

1963
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,238
uh how how um

1964
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,000
probability distributions change over

1965
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
time these kind of problems

1966
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,439
um but then um so so you're right to say

1967
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,080
that information theory started out with

1968
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,839
the study of channels

1969
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,920
communication channels between different

1970
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,920
uh different things

1971
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,399
um and you have a

1972
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,158
yeah there's a lot of work uh on

1973
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:41,759
information theory and channels and

1974
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,158
still today with uh in engineering

1975
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,920
um so

1976
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,759
i would i would guess there's a lot of

1977
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,080
work also on information geometry with

1978
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,120
channels

1979
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,600
but that would be like um a subset of

1980
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,239
the whole field of information geometry

1981
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,600
and i would say it's uh it would be

1982
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,120
yeah i would say the people contributing

1983
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,040
to that literature would be mostly from

1984
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,320
the um from engineering or around

1985
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,960
engineering

1986
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
thanks blue anything there yeah go for

1987
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,280
it yeah if i could just follow really

1988
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,440
quick so the um

1989
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,360
so i know like about information theory

1990
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,880
and like the flow of information in the

1991
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,960
channel say like a telephone line or you

1992
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,800
know whatever like

1993
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,360
some direct method of communication but

1994
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,960
like the way i i don't know i don't know

1995
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,040
if i'm thinking about it in the wrong

1996
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,480
way because when i try to search for

1997
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,280
like information flow in a channel

1998
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,280
um and maybe it's the same but i think

1999
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,280
about it in a different way like i think

2000
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,360
about the channel flowing from

2001
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,600
like the present into the future

2002
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,640
right so like there's only so many like

2003
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,360
next states that are possible right like

2004
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,760
based on my present state and so is it

2005
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,159
is it incorrect or is it correct to

2006
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,719
think about like not a direct channel as

2007
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,640
in i'm speaking to you over this

2008
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,480
internet information channel but like

2009
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,880
the channel from now into some future

2010
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,960
state is that the same kind of like

2011
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,360
mathematical engineering information

2012
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,719
channel

2013
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,760
right um yeah that um yeah you're

2014
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,520
catching me off guard because i don't i

2015
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,920
don't know about channels

2016
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,400
um so i mean what you say sounds sounds

2017
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,640
possible and i would say yes

2018
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,480
but i wouldn't be able to say for sure

2019
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,600
just because i don't know that

2020
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,159
literature

2021
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,719
thanks well

2022
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,800
i'm sure come back to this in the

2023
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,760
weeks and years to come so stephen

2024
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,320
go for it

2025
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,400
yeah i'm

2026
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,960
i'm really interested by the um

2027
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,840
these different um

2028
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,000
tying these bits together in a way i

2029
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,239
suppose that sort of come up um we've

2030
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,120
got

2031
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,800
this sort of

2032
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,520
information geometry that i suppose can

2033
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,080
come from an ergodic space or a kind of

2034
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,760
a state space

2035
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,640
and then you've got solenoidal flows

2036
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,920
within maybe an iso contour of that or

2037
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,360
potentially i suppose it doesn't have to

2038
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,440
be solenoid or it could be like an iso

2039
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,719
contour

2040
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,840
flow if it was more complex

2041
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,960
and

2042
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,920
when you've got that potential

2043
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,159
to um

2044
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,800
go and have a solenoidal type flow to

2045
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,920
sample

2046
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,280
would that be

2047
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,440
um more a slightly more of a second

2048
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,480
order

2049
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,719
sampling approach that something might

2050
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,040
use so you've got you know the

2051
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,199
distribution could just emerge from a

2052
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,000
steady space steady state sort of

2053
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,800
ergodicity process and you would maybe

2054
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,320
somehow

2055
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,520
systematize a flow or way of engaging

2056
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,920
that information and i could i could

2057
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,239
imagine that would then

2058
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,400
make sense of some of the entropy

2059
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,040
entropy consuming potential of a living

2060
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,040
system which is that it can kind of

2061
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,840
go upgrade in descent and

2062
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,000
the solenoidal flow then

2063
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,440
gives scott's

2064
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,239
sort of entropy secreting option it

2065
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,320
seems a bit more viable then because

2066
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,239
maybe i could choose

2067
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,360
multiple solenoidal samplings

2068
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,800
of

2069
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,280
information geometries and

2070
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,600
secrete the ones which aren't as good if

2071
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,480
that makes sense so um so i'll be

2072
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
curious in terms of how

2073
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,280
you know that this the ability to go to

2074
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,400
more second order

2075
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,640
understandings within a system

2076
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,040
um and within the dynamics might be

2077
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,560
offered by

2078
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,360
um

2079
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,440
the solenoid or sampling maybe even

2080
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,440
taking into account things like the the

2081
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,760
landscape used on the um

2082
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,280
the mountain car

2083
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,400
um

2084
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,560
problem you know that landscape if you

2085
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,239
can't sample the whole landscape

2086
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,719
ergodically could you have lots of

2087
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,080
solenoidal

2088
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,760
samples or something like that around

2089
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
the landscape

2090
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,440
yeah um

2091
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,159
yeah it's a really good point so there's

2092
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,320
deep connections between so you know

2093
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,640
flow and information geometry

2094
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,280
and mostly in the context of the as you

2095
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,840
pointed out the sampling literature

2096
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,560
so in um

2097
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,080
so the the idea is that if you start a

2098
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,239
stochastic process somewhere

2099
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,400
and you have solenoidal flow

2100
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,400
it will converge to its steady state a

2101
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,320
lot faster than if it didn't have

2102
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,000
solenoidal flow

2103
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
so then you can quantify that in terms

2104
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,480
of uh information geometry maybe taking

2105
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,360
a shorter path to the steady state

2106
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,080
um and things like that

2107
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,000
um

2108
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,960
so then there's also um a really nice

2109
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,520
new paper actually called um

2110
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,400
is there is there an analog of nesteroff

2111
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,280
acceleration for mcmc

2112
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,239
and so that that paper shows that

2113
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:53,360
um

2114
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,320
yes

2115
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,480
that paper really like does a nice job

2116
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,400
of illustrating some some deep

2117
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,080
connections between

2118
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,400
uh stochastic processes and information

2119
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,280
geometry and so the idea is that if you

2120
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,800
start with a very simple um called a

2121
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,719
very simple process called overdumped

2122
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,880
knowledge of dynamics

2123
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,920
then you can show that um

2124
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,159
actually the the dynamic

2125
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:21,040
in information space

2126
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,679
is doing um so like the process is doing

2127
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,520
a gradient descent on kl divergence

2128
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,320
um to reach to reach the the steady

2129
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,640
state so the target distribution

2130
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,120
so this is just this process is exactly

2131
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,520
doing like standard standard variational

2132
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,800
inference

2133
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,320
but then if you add some solenoidal flow

2134
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,159
you actually

2135
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,239
make that convergence happen faster so

2136
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:50,080
it's like an accelerated method

2137
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,159
and so and so in terms of biology you

2138
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:55,040
can say that if you have solenoidal flow

2139
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,520
um your inference happens faster so

2140
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,880
you're like uh

2141
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,800
you're able to infer things a lot faster

2142
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,920
so you like in a sense more intelligent

2143
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,159
i think we talk about it in in one of

2144
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,840
the figures

2145
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,080
in in the part of the paper

2146
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,159
and so and so in that paper that i just

2147
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,280
mentioned

2148
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,440
uh they showed that with a particular

2149
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,280
stochastic process

2150
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,400
actually

2151
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,480
implement some kind of

2152
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,440
accelerated variational inference

2153
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,719
um

2154
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,640
so yeah there's some literature about

2155
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,280
that and it would be interesting to see

2156
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,440
uh those processes that perform

2157
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,520
inference very fast

2158
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,360
whether when we put them in the bayesian

2159
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,159
mechanics contest whether we can say oh

2160
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,480
these actually

2161
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,800
can be seen to correspond to

2162
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,719
to biological systems that we've been

2163
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,800
studying things like that

2164
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,480
okay i just asked one quick question on

2165
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,360
that

2166
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,800
when you say add in solenoidal flow

2167
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,360
is that adding it in the sampling

2168
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,600
methodology or is it somehow maybe i

2169
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,880
suppose it's a bit could it be thought

2170
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,520
of physically or is that

2171
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,880
how does that work

2172
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,760
yeah definitely so the the sony nodal

2173
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,159
flow is really this time irreversible

2174
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,199
part

2175
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,360
um so so

2176
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,199
intuitively it's this kind of like

2177
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,320
stirring or mixing the system so maybe

2178
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,480
if you have um

2179
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,400
a really nice example actually is if you

2180
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,400
have a cup of coffee

2181
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,960
and you and you pour milk in it

2182
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,640
now what you could do

2183
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,719
is just wait for the milk and the coffee

2184
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,400
to mix together

2185
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,960
and this would be no solenoidal flow

2186
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,120
because you're not mixing anything like

2187
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,360
it's just happening on its own and you

2188
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,760
have a dynamic like in the in the figure

2189
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,600
that we saw before like on the bottom

2190
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,320
left so it would be time reversible

2191
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,080
and this would like actually converge

2192
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,320
the steady state pretty slowly so in

2193
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,159
terms of information geometry you would

2194
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,880
have a slow dynamic to the steady state

2195
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,640
in terms of statistics you would have a

2196
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,800
slow variation of inference because you

2197
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,480
reach your target distribution very

2198
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,000
slowly

2199
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,320
now what you can do is adding in

2200
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,400
solenoidal close so this would be i take

2201
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,239
my spoon and i'm going to

2202
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:09,280
stir the coffee and the milk together

2203
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,520
then we all know then

2204
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,840
that this is going to allow

2205
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,679
the system to mix

2206
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,920
and to and to

2207
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,080
actually become uniformly mixed a lot

2208
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,280
faster

2209
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,600
so so mathematically

2210
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,199
it means that we reach the target

2211
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,520
distribution of the steady state faster

2212
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,080
so the information geometry we're also

2213
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,719
faster in terms of statistics

2214
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,239
you can interpret that as doing

2215
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,480
variational inference faster

2216
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
now this interesting thing about adding

2217
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,960
in solenoidal flow

2218
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,560
is that um

2219
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,400
in physics it's called breaking detail

2220
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,920
balance

2221
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,199
and breaking detail balance is about um

2222
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,320
you actually probably need to to input

2223
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,480
from entered input energy from the

2224
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,560
outside

2225
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,040
um so so this is the physical meaning of

2226
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,800
the time irreversible part of the

2227
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,880
dynamic

2228
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,560
when when there is sometimes

2229
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,520
irreversible part it means that the

2230
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,880
there is

2231
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,560
actually energy coming in from the

2232
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,080
outside

2233
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,880
and and this is also like um it ties in

2234
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,960
nicely with biological systems we know

2235
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,199
that biological systems consume energy

2236
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,560
from the outside

2237
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,880
so we know that they have to be

2238
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,920
that they need to have some kind of

2239
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,440
this irreversible dynamic

2240
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,760
thanks lance so

2241
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,600
anyone else in the live chat who wants

2242
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,120
to ask a question this would be a good

2243
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,600
time to go for it and then dean

2244
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,480
and then anyone else

2245
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,600
let's be gentle on me what i'm about to

2246
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,600
put out there is i just feel really

2247
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,880
vulnerable but i'm gonna throw it out

2248
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,640
there anyway so

2249
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,199
lots of chat chatter about the encoded

2250
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,440
aspect of this and i think we all kind

2251
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,000
of understand what that means

2252
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,960
so

2253
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,080
i'm gonna i'm gonna raise a metaphor

2254
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,840
kind of a

2255
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,159
around negative space and the idea of

2256
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,040
threading a needle

2257
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,360
which is if you think about it as a just

2258
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,840
as a distributive exercise is plenty

2259
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,159
complex like there's a lot of math in

2260
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,800
terms of being able to just do that

2261
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,679
thing that's that's hard hard enough

2262
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,199
so

2263
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,880
if i'm trying to explain to somebody

2264
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,800
else a bayesian manifold and what that

2265
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,560
represents

2266
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,560
can i say that it's both a barrier and a

2267
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,280
filter at the same time can i say that

2268
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,920
it acts kind of like a sieve

2269
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,800
meaning

2270
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,840
meaning that it's mathematical structure

2271
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,880
kind of acts as a ground to the physical

2272
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,159
things that we

2273
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:45,120
are inferring are going on in the world

2274
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,360
so i guess what i'm asking is is

2275
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,520
statistical mechanics

2276
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,639
serving

2277
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:51,440
to

2278
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,080
allow us to understand what negative

2279
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,639
space is as a non-form

2280
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,960
within all

2281
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,760
as as part of all the forms that we're

2282
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,520
seeing the edges of and

2283
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,760
and having a liminal understanding until

2284
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,800
we get to the very limits of what and

2285
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,440
the high definition of what that means

2286
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,880
so

2287
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,199
does the statistical manifold allow us

2288
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,560
to go in around and pass through zero it

2289
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,280
doesn't allow us to reverse the spin of

2290
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,880
the solenoidal

2291
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,719
but it does allow us to get away from

2292
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,120
zero and move closer to what the known

2293
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,920
is

2294
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,800
because

2295
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,199
if i if we continue to kind of go back

2296
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,440
and forth between the physical math and

2297
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,679
the statistical math i know why we have

2298
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,000
to kind of talk

2299
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,360
both at once like we have to have two

2300
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,760
hands to clap but i think it's i think

2301
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,840
what ends up happening is

2302
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,159
in this conversation the encoding and

2303
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,960
the physical piece tends to dominate

2304
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,840
and then and the non-physical stuff the

2305
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,400
statistical stuff maybe that ground that

2306
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,560
the statistical manifold

2307
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,120
allows for it doesn't it hasn't maybe

2308
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,360
been fully fleshed out

2309
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,280
in a way that helps me

2310
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,880
help explain it to other people who

2311
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,199
aren't as far along in this journey as

2312
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,000
you are and i'm hoping to get to a place

2313
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,440
where i can

2314
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,920
translate it for them so maybe you can

2315
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,760
just talk to that a little bit about

2316
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,239
what is the statistical manifold is it

2317
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,880
just the hard stuff that we see or

2318
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,719
should we be paying attention

2319
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,040
to maybe the spaces between all of those

2320
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,960
data points

2321
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,480
right um

2322
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,000
yeah so

2323
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,760
that's a a really interesting and

2324
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,520
actually a hard question to answer um

2325
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,920
but just to start with the the easy part

2326
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,800
the the statistical manifold

2327
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
is the mathematical object

2328
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,760
that that says these are all the beliefs

2329
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,360
all the different beliefs that you could

2330
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,960
hold about your environment right and so

2331
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,159
as time

2332
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,000
as time evolves and you're gathering new

2333
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,199
information

2334
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:58,719
your

2335
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,880
what your brain is doing is moving on

2336
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,040
this statistical manifold your beliefs

2337
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,639
are changing

2338
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,239
over time and then in terms of um

2339
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,000
explaining it to people

2340
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,040
so the

2341
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,280
always the the way the way that i try to

2342
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,520
explain it is that

2343
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,280
this um this like in information talk um

2344
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,719
things encoding

2345
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:21,600
things

2346
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,679
things encoding information about other

2347
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:24,880
things

2348
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,840
it's just a different description

2349
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,600
of the world

2350
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,760
so we have a description that that takes

2351
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,480
like matter and waves and forces and

2352
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,239
things like that and then we have a

2353
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,080
different description that looks at

2354
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,360
information

2355
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,679
and i think these two descriptions

2356
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,280
are equivalent

2357
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,920
um it's just two different ways to talk

2358
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,040
about the same thing

2359
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,480
on the other hand this um

2360
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,800
way of talking about the world in terms

2361
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,360
of information flows and information

2362
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,960
processing

2363
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,920
i think

2364
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,080
it might be more general in the sense

2365
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,560
that instead of needing to have like

2366
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,000
matter and

2367
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,520
all these different concepts different

2368
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,440
kinds of particles and it gets really

2369
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,120
messy

2370
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,679
maybe it would be possible to unify more

2371
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,159
with the concept of information because

2372
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,159
with information you can explain what a

2373
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,639
photon is and what

2374
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,600
what a proton is and and you name it so

2375
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,000
so it would be more um

2376
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,639
more unified and maybe more

2377
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,639
mathematically simple at the end of the

2378
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,880
day but that remains to be seen

2379
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,199
um interestingly so so there's this guy

2380
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,360
evolved from from uh the computational

2381
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,360
engine evolved from alpha so

2382
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,679
this guy this guy's actually a physicist

2383
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,679
i didn't know that until very recently

2384
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,120
but he

2385
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,800
has been doing some really interesting

2386
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,360
work over the past few years

2387
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,360
working towards a theory of everything

2388
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,040
that is based on the concept of

2389
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,199
information so information and

2390
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,000
computation is the

2391
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,719
like the the thing he starts with

2392
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:05,600
and i think he's managed to

2393
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,960
um he basically postulates that the

2394
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,280
that the um

2395
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,719
the world

2396
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,719
evolves in time

2397
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,120
according to some kind of computation

2398
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,080
that's recursively applied to itself

2399
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,840
so

2400
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,080
you you could think of it in terms of a

2401
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,560
dynamical system but so it's a like the

2402
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,159
way he thinks about it is a bit more

2403
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,960
general but it would be like maybe

2404
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,679
um you give a number to a program and

2405
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,760
then the program outputs a number and

2406
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,239
then so that would be one time step

2407
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,400
and then you reapply the program to that

2408
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,480
number that would be another time step

2409
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,159
and so he can he

2410
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,000
and so he postulates that the universe

2411
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,520
works in that way

2412
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,600
um it evolves um according to like

2413
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,679
discrete steps

2414
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:56,080
with a repeated program and the program

2415
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,239
would be the laws of physics it's like

2416
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,560
kind of an abstract informational way to

2417
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,679
look at it

2418
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,600
and so the

2419
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,320
so yeah so he he makes this um this very

2420
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,199
abstract approach to physics

2421
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,760
and uh and and also very simple i mean

2422
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,000
very kind of unified approach to physics

2423
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,080
and i think he's managed to derive

2424
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
approximations to the equations of

2425
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,600
relativity

2426
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,000
just with that so with a certain kind of

2427
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,800
program i mean anyway he's been um

2428
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,719
doing some really interesting

2429
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,960
work trying to unify known physics with

2430
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,040
the concept of information

2431
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,840
and he's written a very nice uh

2432
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,320
article like a blog post about it i

2433
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,520
think if you

2434
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,800
if you google like a wolfram theory of

2435
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,760
everything you might you might come up

2436
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,040
it might come up

2437
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,360
um but yeah it's um

2438
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,920
i mean it's not it's not technical i

2439
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,760
mean it is technical somehow but it's

2440
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,960
not like

2441
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,120
there's no equations it's conceptually i

2442
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,760
think conceptually hard what he does but

2443
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,920
the way he explains it is nice

2444
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,880
um

2445
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,400
so yeah i think we're moving to this

2446
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,239
kind of

2447
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:05,760
information-based physics but doesn't

2448
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,440
mean that the physics that we know with

2449
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,000
matter and so on should be discarded

2450
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,760
uh it's just like different different

2451
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,679
levels to talk about it just like we

2452
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,639
have

2453
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,920
um psychology that talks about the brain

2454
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,440
uh from a

2455
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,000
like very overall perspective

2456
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and then we have like

2457
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,800
yeah talking about like maybe biases uh

2458
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
our biases decision making so that would

2459
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,560
be one description of the world and then

2460
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,600
we have

2461
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,600
molecular dynamics that will look at the

2462
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,600
brain from a very

2463
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,880
um

2464
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,520
from a basic molecular level

2465
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,800
um

2466
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,639
and and all these descriptions have to

2467
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,719
fit together somehow

2468
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,719
and i think depending depending on what

2469
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,719
we're trying to ask uh

2470
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,560
one description would be more fit than

2471
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,920
the other so

2472
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,920
if i'm studying a human psychology is

2473
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,159
probably much more useful than molecular

2474
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,480
dynamics

2475
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,560
thanks lance one quick comment on the

2476
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,199
information is it allows us to drop into

2477
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,400
a mode of matter and organization as

2478
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,760
information

2479
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,760
um which is still within the objective

2480
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,400
stance but also it allows us to model

2481
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,000
ourselves and our beliefs and thinking

2482
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,840
about them informationally about other

2483
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,159
beliefs or about matter which is a way

2484
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,920
of mathematically

2485
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,480
complementing the relational stance

2486
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,360
so it also moves us towards wolfram's

2487
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,360
vision of what new science would look

2488
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,520
like because we actually have

2489
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,239
quantitative relational techniques that

2490
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,239
help us deal with our uncertainty and

2491
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:37,840
about the way that we interact with the

2492
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
world actively

2493
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,080
interfering and measuring and

2494
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,360
manipulating

2495
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,920
not just like us walled off as the

2496
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,159
investigator trying to get to the most

2497
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,840
exact

2498
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,320
framing of a system so it's really

2499
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,639
interesting developments so we have time

2500
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,280
for some more questions so scott

2501
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,040
and then after that we'll go to steven

2502
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,400
so go ahead scott

2503
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,159
a couple of little thoughts on that last

2504
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,480
bit so that that

2505
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,159
multiple dynamics that you were talking

2506
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,000
about very interesting it got me

2507
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,520
thinking about

2508
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,320
that coast of england problem

2509
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,639
from um fractals where if you measure

2510
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,159
the coast of england with a one mile

2511
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:18,320
yardstick versus a one inch yardstick if

2512
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,760
it's a one inch yardstick the coast of

2513
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,280
england is longer

2514
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,880
right it's because you're measuring more

2515
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,320
than nooks and crannies right in the

2516
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,120
fractal uh coast so

2517
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,480
that scale

2518
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,080
dependence when you talk about the

2519
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,679
dependency we see

2520
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,679
nature and see biology through different

2521
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:34,800
lenses

2522
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,400
it's kind of interesting if we have a

2523
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,040
unifying lens maybe you start to have a

2524
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,199
fractal and scale independent

2525
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,199
descriptors then we'll pop out of that

2526
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,560
because you'll start to have things

2527
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,880
that'll

2528
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,800
anyway it feels like this skewer coming

2529
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,600
at descriptions of systems as you were

2530
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,280
saying from different in different ways

2531
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,440
they're the same system ultimately and

2532
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,040
so there'll be an interesting analysis

2533
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,520
on the way in which they come together i

2534
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,679
guess is that this one piece another

2535
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:02,560
thing

2536
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,280
the

2537
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,960
mention about information and the um

2538
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,159
that kind of wolfram idea that expansion

2539
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,360
um one of the things i had a

2540
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,880
conversation with a couple of um

2541
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,480
astrophysicists and i was talking to

2542
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,360
them about

2543
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,120
um seth lloyd out of mit a part of his

2544
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,280
book called programming the universe he

2545
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,400
talks about

2546
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,040
the idea that all interactions since the

2547
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,600
big bang have increased exponentially

2548
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,280
just the number the volume of

2549
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,480
interactions

2550
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,679
and

2551
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,360
i was talking to somebody about it and

2552
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,639
they said well

2553
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,199
if the universe is made of information

2554
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,719
then the exponential increase in

2555
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,880
information maybe that's what dark

2556
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,280
energy is we perceive dark energy that

2557
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,600
expansion force as being

2558
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,120
something but really what it is is the

2559
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,199
universe expanding out exponentially

2560
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,960
because it's made of information and so

2561
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,239
something just to think about it kind of

2562
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,239
leaps around there between physics and

2563
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,040
information theory but there's um

2564
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,480
that's one other piece of it and then

2565
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,199
the other piece of it was this

2566
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,880
idea the outside energy you were talking

2567
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,120
about before the need for outside energy

2568
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,400
one of the things that i've been fussing

2569
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,719
around with is whether in fact and in

2570
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,199
2013 i did a presentation mit called

2571
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,880
entropy accounting

2572
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,920
and then the year after they did

2573
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,320
something called entropy engines and the

2574
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,880
idea that was that was that in

2575
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,560
information theory in carnot's equation

2576
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,239
you need a hot and cold differential to

2577
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:23,840
perform work

2578
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,920
um carnot's equation those differentials

2579
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,840
are identical to arbitrage differentials

2580
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,800
you need for a market to perform to move

2581
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,239
if there's no information differentials

2582
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,320
you don't have trading in markets and so

2583
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,159
one of the questions is

2584
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,679
roger penrose wrote a book recently

2585
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,280
about the time before the big bang what

2586
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,960
he talks about is we have the yellow

2587
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,040
light of the sun come in and the

2588
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,840
infrared light go out we don't overheat

2589
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,520
except for climate change and carbon

2590
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,199
dioxide blankets

2591
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,080
because the net energy gain is zero

2592
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,000
right energy and energy otherwise we'd

2593
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,239
overheat he said what we gain

2594
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,159
is neg entropy because the yellow light

2595
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,840
of the sun has a higher information

2596
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,360
carrying capacity than the red light

2597
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,440
that goes out plants construct

2598
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,120
themselves from the yellow light of the

2599
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,920
sun

2600
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,040
create neg entropy and then we

2601
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:09,760
now

2602
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,639
projecting forward are now burning that

2603
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,719
fossil fuel that stored up that neg

2604
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,360
entropy and releasing disorder

2605
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,880
in the form of

2606
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,840
now climate change disorder

2607
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,159
political and social disorder so where

2608
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,239
i'm jumping around there is suggesting

2609
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:28,639
that disorder

2610
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,000
accounting

2611
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,679
and entropy accounting when you have von

2612
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,000
neumann and shannon's link of physics

2613
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,760
and information and other links like we

2614
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,199
have here

2615
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,719
that maybe when we're talking about

2616
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,440
entropy as disorder we can talk about it

2617
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,880
not by analogy but direct application to

2618
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,960
social contexts

2619
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,120
and start to use information and

2620
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,920
understand disorder in society and in

2621
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,159
markets as uh amenable to the same kind

2622
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,080
of math that we find in some of these

2623
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,000
biological systems thanks just a few

2624
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,280
thoughts

2625
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,120
thanks scott lance if you want to add

2626
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,080
anything

2627
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,880
sure um yeah that was really interesting

2628
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,520
and um yeah so

2629
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,080
um i want to add actually that

2630
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,480
uh all this um

2631
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,960
the thing that we talk about about like

2632
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,719
reality can be described at different

2633
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,239
scales

2634
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,400
and i think there's a nice extension to

2635
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,400
this work that that speaks to that you

2636
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,440
could

2637
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,679
um if you look at a human i mean it's

2638
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,239
composed of a lot of cells and each cell

2639
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,239
has its own boundary and then these

2640
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,239
cells form organs that themselves have

2641
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:37,040
their own boundary so there's um

2642
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,679
let's read this recursive aspect of like

2643
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,840
markov blankets being assembled together

2644
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,120
at different scales and i think um

2645
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,280
i think it would be interesting

2646
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,960
interesting to impact that because i

2647
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,400
think that's how

2648
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,480
biological systems are formed but also

2649
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,960
societies are formed as collections of

2650
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,960
multiple different individuals that are

2651
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,800
themselves that themselves form

2652
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,960
organizations that

2653
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,440
um that talk to each other and form

2654
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,159
together a society so it's really this

2655
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,320
recursive aspect and

2656
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,400
being able to hopefully use the same

2657
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,480
kind of math to talk about all these

2658
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,159
different aspects

2659
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,520
and

2660
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,600
and also i mean

2661
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,560
people um it's true like a lot of people

2662
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,520
in the past maybe 10 20 years maybe more

2663
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,920
they've used the same kind of

2664
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,920
dynamical models that we have in this

2665
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,840
paper i mean so very very standard

2666
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,120
models to

2667
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,920
model for example interactions between

2668
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,040
people

2669
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,000
and in particular models of opinion

2670
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
formation

2671
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,760
so for example maybe let's say we're in

2672
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,400
the us and some people are democrats

2673
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,560
some of our republicans some cannot

2674
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,960
really make their mind yet and so they

2675
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,320
would talk to each other they would

2676
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,440
interact

2677
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,960
and then they would converge onto a

2678
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,679
steady state

2679
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,679
where some

2680
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,760
yeah some some people would be die hard

2681
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,920
democrats in that city state so they

2682
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,400
would kind of stay in that area

2683
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,679
some people would be die hard

2684
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,159
republicans and some people would like

2685
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:11,440
yeah fluctuate flock to it in the middle

2686
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,119
um so

2687
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,199
i i think we can use

2688
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,159
i mean

2689
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:19,119
this math about stochastic processes and

2690
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:22,000
information is really the

2691
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,600
um

2692
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,040
yeah the the

2693
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,639
ground i mean the

2694
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:27,360
the

2695
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,520
a good framework or useful framework to

2696
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,920
to model many kinds of things

2697
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,520
um

2698
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,639
but then

2699
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,719
i think what a lot of these models are

2700
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,800
missing is really this belief based

2701
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,840
aspect

2702
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,760
so a lot of these models of opinion

2703
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,719
formation there they just say oh i'm a

2704
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,639
particle you're a particle and we

2705
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,199
interact just like particles in physics

2706
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:50,639
with interact

2707
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,920
um so so it's quite simplistic um

2708
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,080
so i think once you i mean uh things are

2709
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,520
very small

2710
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,360
maybe we can describe them in a very

2711
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,880
simple way

2712
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,520
um but as you as like marco blankets

2713
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,360
self-organize at different scales and

2714
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,320
actually

2715
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,360
as you go to larger and larger scales

2716
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,400
um

2717
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,480
things become a lot more complex

2718
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,719
and i would say maybe we are the scale

2719
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,400
at which things are

2720
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,760
most complex

2721
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,800
or molecules tend to be quite simple we

2722
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,560
tend to be quite complex and then if you

2723
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,239
go up and up again

2724
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,920
maybe to planets

2725
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,000
then things start to become really

2726
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,360
simple again

2727
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,280
because all these random fluctuations

2728
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,520
are kind of average average doubt and

2729
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,440
then we have newtonian mechanics where

2730
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,320
everything kind of looks deterministic

2731
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,080
so i think there's this like

2732
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,639
sweet spot we're in where we're not too

2733
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,719
big and not too small

2734
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,440
and interesting things happen there

2735
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,560
um

2736
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,560
and that's where i would say that's

2737
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,520
where i would say bayesian mechanics um

2738
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,679
is hoping to fit in

2739
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:00,400
in terms of uh explaining and describing

2740
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,040
what's going on

2741
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:07,839
cool so stephen go for it

2742
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:09,600
yeah

2743
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,320
that that um that idea again that brings

2744
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,080
us back to embodiment i suppose because

2745
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,679
we're embodied at

2746
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,960
a particular size and scale and

2747
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,880
um they sort of say if you go right down

2748
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,639
to the smallest scale

2749
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,400
of like and then right up to the biggest

2750
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,360
scale

2751
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,239
we are kind of in the middle

2752
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,119
um

2753
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,760
ironically but so i was wondering how

2754
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,960
sort of following on from what you're

2755
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,880
saying and bringing in the computational

2756
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,800
psychiatry piece that you sort of

2757
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,639
alluded to to this is

2758
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,679
if we if we say that we've got

2759
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,840
everything that we perceive even the

2760
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
physicality of the world

2761
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,159
we actually only have access it through

2762
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:51,119
information anyway even if we are

2763
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,760
actually accessing the the true physical

2764
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,800
world

2765
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,800
so we've got this process of sense

2766
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,760
making that we're doing to to make that

2767
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,000
idea of what is our consensus reality so

2768
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,080
if our kind of working space that we're

2769
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,719
in is our consensus reality

2770
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,880
what's interesting is that

2771
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,760
with

2772
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,960
psychology and social sciences

2773
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,719
you can almost say psychology is a bit

2774
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:15,520
like

2775
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,920
the predictive processing

2776
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,920
model of the world it's like these are

2777
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,960
predicted ways that are out there

2778
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,520
um that have been chosen as the models

2779
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,840
within a particular sort of discrete

2780
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,600
spaces

2781
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,239
and those are externally managed so it's

2782
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,839
like an externally managed

2783
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,400
system entry percent there could be an

2784
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,880
entry repeat secreting system where it

2785
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,880
looks like there is although entropy is

2786
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,199
not actually a substance to secrete per

2787
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,080
se

2788
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,600
and you could say that it's externally

2789
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,920
managed information geometry that the

2790
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,159
social science as well with the averages

2791
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,400
and the psychometrics that they

2792
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,719
reference to they're all sort of housed

2793
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,800
out there in the world and you've kind

2794
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,920
of got

2795
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,239
the kind of what we see is our reality

2796
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,400
in the phenomenology of our experience

2797
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,119
is kind of the boundary but what

2798
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,520
your work's doing and what computational

2799
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,000
psychiatry does and which we're not able

2800
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,480
to do without those tools

2801
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,080
is it allows us to go into that

2802
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,679
neurobiology

2803
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,960
and the actual like the internal

2804
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,719
internally managed

2805
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,040
stochastical dynamics of our own models

2806
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,880
so to speak so not the ones that we make

2807
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,080
out there to be our perspective on

2808
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,600
which we try and reduce free energy

2809
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,800
around but just what is the models that

2810
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,800
we're doing what you call entropy

2811
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,600
consuming i we're actually

2812
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,280
just swimming in that entropy and

2813
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,840
finding the variations right

2814
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,480
and so i'm curious like

2815
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,360
that that that ability for this type of

2816
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,719
work to

2817
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,400
contribute

2818
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,719
to a new kind of

2819
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,199
um way of knowing about

2820
01:39:57,199 --> 01:40:00,000
what it is to be in the world and go

2821
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,880
into our internal models rather than

2822
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,400
be reliant on these external

2823
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,719
psychological and social science models

2824
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,639
what's your thoughts on

2825
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,440
how this might link into developing that

2826
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,820
that field

2827
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,600
[Music]

2828
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,480
so

2829
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,480
so are you talking specifically about

2830
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,320
the link between

2831
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,800
all this physics and and the psychology

2832
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,400
or or is your question a bit more

2833
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,600
general um well maybe the the boundary

2834
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,199
between the kind of

2835
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:31,440
like the scales of basically the

2836
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,840
boundary of going for externally making

2837
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,080
models of the world and standard models

2838
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,920
like psychologists are doing and social

2839
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,159
sciences are doing and psychometrics and

2840
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,639
the ability to actually go into our own

2841
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,320
models our own phenomenological

2842
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,840
neurobiological

2843
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,600
models and just say okay what are the

2844
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,960
dynamics

2845
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,679
that are alive not what are and

2846
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,239
how we how are we actually managing not

2847
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,800
how do we manage our models of what we

2848
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,159
think they are which is kind of what

2849
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:00,960
happens in our kind of niche but we're

2850
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,239
able to probe

2851
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,080
our own phenomenology so i was wondering

2852
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,679
how you see that tying into that

2853
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,000
yeah um yeah that's a that's a really

2854
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,199
good point

2855
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,840
so so as you as you point out i mean

2856
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,960
now models in like psychology and

2857
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,600
and uh computational psychiatry i mean

2858
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,600
they're driven by intuition they're

2859
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,239
driven by by experiment

2860
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,239
and they're driven also by your own

2861
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,520
biases

2862
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,400
um

2863
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,119
and our observations about um

2864
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,080
yeah patients who who suffer some some

2865
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,239
kind of um

2866
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,360
yeah some kind of let's say

2867
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,800
schizophrenia

2868
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,119
and so we know we know schizophrenic

2869
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:44,000
patrons behave like this and like that

2870
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,320
and so we try to create models that kind

2871
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,920
of reproduce that

2872
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,000
and then we try to

2873
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,280
um to validate these models by saying oh

2874
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,600
uh maybe i can simulate some kind of uh

2875
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,320
action potentials of some neurons and

2876
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,400
then i'm gonna check

2877
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,639
whether actually these organisms that

2878
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,440
i'm studying have this um

2879
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,199
same kind of action potential the same

2880
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,119
kind of

2881
01:42:08,119 --> 01:42:10,639
electrophysiological responses

2882
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,080
um

2883
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,440
so i think that

2884
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,000
i mean i think that's really good um and

2885
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,159
and the research is doing a lot of

2886
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,520
progress

2887
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,560
um

2888
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,520
but then

2889
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,760
this kind of work not not this paper but

2890
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,679
this line of work

2891
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,880
would be able to to like

2892
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,080
go the i mean um

2893
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,480
i mean it takes a different perspective

2894
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,800
and would be able ultimately hopefully

2895
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,119
to describe mathematically

2896
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:44,480
um what thinking like a human is uh what

2897
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,719
what is being human mathematically and

2898
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,760
of course there won't be like a

2899
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,639
definition of this is a human

2900
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,119
but they would hopefully be in the

2901
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,520
future a mathematical description of how

2902
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,679
we make decisions

2903
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,239
and what class of models are we

2904
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:04,320
implementing to make sense of the world

2905
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,400
and how can we characterize these models

2906
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,400
in terms of and and hopefully um the

2907
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,800
community will get to that through

2908
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,280
through physical experiments but also

2909
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,480
through like

2910
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,280
just mathematical conceptualization

2911
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,920
um i think using using mathematics you

2912
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,080
can

2913
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,800
you cannot get you cannot just get there

2914
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,719
without any like kind of experiment but

2915
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:31,370
you still can

2916
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:32,480
[Music]

2917
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,280
there's still quite a few constraints um

2918
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,639
that we have on

2919
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:39,760
that we know that that humans have looks

2920
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,400
for example breaking detail balance um

2921
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,880
creation of entropy all these things we

2922
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,840
we know

2923
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,199
we know humans satisfy like uh

2924
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,880
i mean they have a lot of um

2925
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,360
characteristics and we can incorporate

2926
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,440
that in the physics and i think this

2927
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,040
really constrains the model space

2928
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,679
that then people in psychology can go

2929
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,880
and look into

2930
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,199
so it just feels like um

2931
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,800
when you're digging a tunnel and

2932
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,960
psychology would like kind of dig in one

2933
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,000
way

2934
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,560
and basic mechanics would be digging

2935
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,560
from the other direction and at some

2936
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,440
point

2937
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,040
uh they will meet in the middle

2938
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,080
hopefully um but i don't i don't think

2939
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,239
they have met really yet and it will

2940
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:26,799
take a while

2941
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,800
awesome

2942
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,000
um

2943
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,199
what

2944
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,920
a fun discussion and it's so cool how

2945
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,520
this paper it's almost like there was a

2946
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,960
few stairs

2947
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,800
we we explored

2948
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,280
some basic ways to frame

2949
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,159
how

2950
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,400
nodes on a bayesian graph insulate other

2951
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,679
sets of nodes

2952
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,880
and then how that conditional

2953
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,920
independence can be finessed for these

2954
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,199
increasingly developed and elaborated

2955
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,360
networks that do

2956
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,280
as we talked about

2957
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,440
expectations over external states all

2958
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,880
the way up to variational base and then

2959
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,199
it's like we at the top or at the middle

2960
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:07,280
of that staircase started taking it in a

2961
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:08,960
lot of other directions so this was

2962
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,280
really a fun discussion

2963
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,440
just in the last few minutes

2964
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,119
maybe we can

2965
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,679
any and all of us think like what are we

2966
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:18,480
gonna

2967
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,320
continue working on for some of us

2968
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,800
that's probably a research project

2969
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,320
others that's

2970
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,719
i don't know lunch or something else

2971
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,040
just how are we going to keep on

2972
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,560
learning about this

2973
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,440
and

2974
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,360
start to apply it in our own work or

2975
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,760
research

2976
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,400
so i have a really good question liz are

2977
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,320
you working on um

2978
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,000
the

2979
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,440
next paper where you're going to

2980
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,600
partition the external state space or

2981
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,199
have you started or it's just like

2982
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,440
clicking on a backburner somewhere

2983
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,719
uh it's not cooking yet so so you can

2984
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,960
uh you're more than welcome to to go

2985
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,719
ahead and

2986
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,719
and start plowing

2987
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,639
it's at the farmers markets the

2988
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,880
ingredients are still out there and dave

2989
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,520
also raised in an email some really

2990
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,440
interesting questions about other

2991
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,880
partitionings

2992
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,400
and um

2993
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,040
basically philosophical threads that

2994
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,600
might be translated into different

2995
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,520
possible partitionings

2996
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,080
within internal states or

2997
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,400
other ways of partitioning because

2998
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,040
it was the partitioning of the blanket

2999
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,199
states from kind of one set of

3000
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,600
blanketing states into incoming sensory

3001
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,239
and outgoing action active states that

3002
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:34,800
allowed for this perception as inference

3003
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,119
action planning as inference

3004
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:38,080
step

3005
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,159
and it's not that that's the end game of

3006
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:41,679
node partitioning

3007
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,280
so there's so many ways that these

3008
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,960
partitions can continue stephen

3009
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,639
yeah i'm gonna be

3010
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,880
i'm trying to see how i like that

3011
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,960
analogy the two tunnels or whichever way

3012
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:56,239
the maybe it's a whole load of like um

3013
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,639
insect warrens or whatever it is trying

3014
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,880
to meet and um so psychology and

3015
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,239
bringing together some of these

3016
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:03,920
processes so i'm going to try and bring

3017
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,639
that together maybe more actually not so

3018
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:08,239
much from a clinical perspective but

3019
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:10,960
maybe more from a community psychology

3020
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,960
and psychosocial psychosocial

3021
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,760
methodologies that might be used so

3022
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,560
um

3023
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,960
i i'm going to be chewing on that as

3024
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,520
best i can so maybe if i ever stuck it

3025
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,280
might i might fire you an email if

3026
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,840
that's okay

3027
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,360
yeah um

3028
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,679
there's many ways we can continue and

3029
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:34,719
also i think all along our trails we

3030
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,800
dropped a few little notes for some

3031
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,639
other pieces that could come into play

3032
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,119
if anyone else wants to raise their

3033
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,800
jitsie hand

3034
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,440
we can take a last thought

3035
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,760
otherwise though just in closing lance

3036
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,760
this was awesome and conor as well for

3037
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,520
joining the first live stream this was a

3038
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,400
great

3039
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,159
uh development we all learned a ton so

3040
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,719
