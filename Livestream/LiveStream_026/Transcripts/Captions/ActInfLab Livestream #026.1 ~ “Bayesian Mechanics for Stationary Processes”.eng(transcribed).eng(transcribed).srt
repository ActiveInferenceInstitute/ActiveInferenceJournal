00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,519
hello everyone welcome to the active

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,759
inference lab today it is august 10th

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,079
2021 and we're here in live stream

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,560
number 26.1 discussing bayesian

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,600
mechanics for stationary processes

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
welcome to the active inference lab if

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
it's your first time or not

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
we are a participatory online lab that

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
is communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
applied active inference you can find us

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,880
at the links here on this slide

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
this is a recorded and an archived live

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,559
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,399
feedback so that we can improve on our

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,840
work

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,160
welcome here and we'll be following good

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,079
video etiquette for live streams so

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
people can just raise their hand

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
visually or in the jitsi if they want to

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
speak

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
this short link here has our calendar of

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
live streams for the year

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
and we're here in number 26 where today

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,359
on the 10th and then next week on the

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
17th we're going to be continuing

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
discussion on the bayesian mechanics for

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
stationary processes paper

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
and then we're going to launch into some

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
other papers so take a look at that link

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
if you want to learn more

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
today in live stream number 26.1 the

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,159
goal is going to be to learn and discuss

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,400
thankfully and really appreciatively

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
with some of the authors of the paper

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,840
we're going to be discussing this

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
bayesian mechanics for stationary

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,200
processes paper

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
and

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
asking questions writing things down we

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
want to look up over the coming week and

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
just seeing

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
what is uh

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
fun to talk about in this paper

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
so we'll start with just an introduction

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
and a warm-up of the non-authors and

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
then we'll go to the authors for

48
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
conveying anything that they'd like to

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,479
just at the outset

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
so i'm daniel and i'm a postdoc in

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,600
california i'll pass it to awful

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
work in the air modern collective

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
intelligence

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
i founded and coordinate the kerosene

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
research laboratory on building

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
inactive models for navigating the

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,119
anthropocene

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,239
thank you let's go to stephen and then

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480

hello welcome my name's steven syllett

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
i'm based in toronto and uh looking

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
forward to hearing the new developments

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
in active influence this paper covers

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
great and then

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,599
dean

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
good morning i'm i'm dean i'm a

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
retired guy i live in calgary and i'm

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
trying to

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,319
see what uh new insights can be provided

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
by all this math because it's quite

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,119
impressive to me

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,400
cool so on to lance and conor whichever

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
one of you would like to go first and

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
sort of

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
give us the give us the big picture and

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
how we got here and how you got to this

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,599
work before we jump into the paper

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
do you want to go

79
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
uh you you should go headlines right

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
um so so hi everyone and thanks for

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,200
inviting me daniel

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
so my name is lance and i'm doing a phd

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,599
in math and neuroscience in london

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
with uh cal pristine and greg pavliotis

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
and basically i i came to writing this

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
paper and doing this kind of research

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
because i'm interested in the question

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
of artificial intelligence

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
and i think

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
a lot of people who are doing machine

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
learning are approaching the question

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
from an engineering perspective

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
but i'm more interested in the

94
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
scientific perspective the scientific

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
question of what intelligence is what

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,159
intelligence is

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
and what do we really need to to create

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
an intelligent system

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760
and so

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
um

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
researching around what what people were

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,599
doing i i found about i found out about

103
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,920
the free energy principle

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
and to me was um

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
the most mathematical piece of work

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,799
that i had that i had seen in

107
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
neuroscience and it seemed like it could

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
encompass many things

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
and he also had applications in active

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,238
inference

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
to model the brain and

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
ungenerate autonomous agents

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
and so now in my phd my goal is to

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
deeply understand the free energy

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
principle

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
and

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,639
to to lay out the mathematical

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
foundations because i think the free

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
energy principle started out as an

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
intuition

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
and gradually people have

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,479
tried to to make it more formal and

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
grounded in mathematics

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
um and so this is what we're trying to

125
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
do in this paper so it's not

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
this paper is not the end but i think

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
it's a step forward

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
so i'm really excited to

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
to share it and

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,280
ex

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,719
like talk about it with you guys

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
awesome sounds really cool about

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
starting as an intuition and then

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
working to ground in mathematics or or

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
then would it be grounded in intuition

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,639
and then elaborated with mathematics so

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
connor

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
yeah thanks i'm happy to be here um and

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
good morning good afternoon to some of

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,120
you depending on the time zone

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
so yeah my name is connor heinz i'm a

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
phd student at the max punk institute

143
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
for animal behavior the department of

144
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
collective behavior in constance germany

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
and i'm co-advised by

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
carl fristen at ucl and then ian cousin

147
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
who's my advisor in constance i'm in the

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
u.s at the moment uh but yeah so i

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,000
i'm also generally interested in

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
bayesian mechanics i think so lance and

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
i started our our phds at the same time

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
and ever since i found out that lance

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
was also interested in kind of the

154
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
mathematical foundations of the free

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
energy principle we've been in

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
discussions about bayesian mechanics for

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
a long time so i was really grateful

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
that he invited me to contribute to this

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
paper

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
and kind of it relates to my own

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
interests because i actually used to be

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
more involved in neuroscience now i've

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
moved more onto the idea that

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
any generic complex system can be

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
described as engaging in a kind of

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
process of approximate bayesian

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
inference and so i'm exploring that in

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
my own research in the context of

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
collective collective behavior so in

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
particular things like collective motion

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
like schooling and fish and flocking and

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
birds

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
so this paper i think

174
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
it gets at kind of the mathematical

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
foundations of sentience and autonomy in

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
all kinds of systems not just

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
nervous systems so that's why the the

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
framing in terms of stochastic processes

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
i think is really powerful because it

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
allows us to extend the framework to all

181
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
kinds of complex adaptive systems not

182
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,599
just the ones we might associate the

183
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
predictive coding free energy

184
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,638
formulation with like brains

185
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
thanks and a really nice point that like

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
there's activity in the nervous system

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
but it's not moving or the subunits are

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
not moving around so what are the

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
similarities and the differences or

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
what's the framework that's going to

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
allow us to

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
accommodate systems that are moving

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
around like the schools of fish flocks

194
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
of bird and then systems where the

195
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,919
topology is either fixed or slowly

196
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,880
changing

197
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,599
and

198
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
we have to do similar kinds of dynamical

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,960
analyses so also welcome dave

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
so stephen i see your hand raised go for

201
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
it and then anyone else who wants to ask

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
a question at this stage yeah just i'd

203
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
like to comment i think that was thanks

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
for the introductions and those insights

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
i think um you know as there's been this

206
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
progression oh

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
we've gone from bayesian approaches and

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
how we had predictive processing

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
approaches and active influence approach

210
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,560
approaches it's it's nice to also think

211
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
about okay once we start to generalize

212
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
it can be nice to go back

213
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
um to the bayesian

214
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,440
for idea more broadly and see okay

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
now the active influence supports all of

216
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
that you could then start to open the

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
net so to speak so i'm interested in a

218
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,280
lot of community psychology approaches

219
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,319
and

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
even interactive theater and immersive

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
theater where you're trying to work with

222
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
people's sense-making so i like that

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
re-broadening to maybe a more heuristic

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,919
mindset

225
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,359
so i thought that was interesting

226
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,080
cool so anyone can raise their hand um

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
if at any point but

228
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
let me just maybe start with our as we

229
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
tiptoe to the edge of the paper like

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
what brought you

231
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
either of the authors to this framing

232
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
did you find something in the junkyard

233
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
that was looked over or was there

234
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,040
something that was already being worked

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
on and you wanted to introduce a new

236
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
thread or how did it come to be composed

237
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
and worked on in this way

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,600
um

239
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
well so that there has been um

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
so i think kel fristen has been working

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
like for the past decade

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,839
trying to put

243
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,040
mathematics uh on the free energy

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
principle and trying to explain why

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
um

246
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
so as i mentioned before i think the

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
free energy principle started out as an

248
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,399
intuition

249
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,760
and i think he has been working for the

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
past decade

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
in on a mathematical theory or a

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
physical theory for why the free energy

253
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,959
principle

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
should hold um

255
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
as an explanation for

256
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
what the brain is doing

257
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
and so

258
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,600
what we wanted to do in this paper is to

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
um to actually take take these

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,680
developments uh that were mostly coming

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
from physics

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
um and that weren't necessarily as

263
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
general as they could be or as

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,360
mathematically rigorous as they could be

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
and actually put it on a fair

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
mathematical framework

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
and try to explain it clearly and

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
i mean as clearly as possible

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,760
so that was the goal here

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,640
so what do you think that intuition was

271
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
or maybe there's a lot of ways that i'm

272
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
sure fristen and others have said it but

273
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,880
what is the intuition that at least you

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
are pursuing with this work

275
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
right um so i think

276
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
the the intuition

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
so i think it came it came from two two

278
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
different ways um from from two

279
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
different ideas so so the first idea is

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,800
if you come from machine learning

281
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
and you look at machine learning from a

282
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,839
very broad perspective you look at many

283
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
different algorithms

284
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
and you look at what they do you look at

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
many different problems and you look at

286
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
what they do

287
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
and it actually turns out um and i think

288
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,839
that's something that people started to

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
realize in the early like 2000s

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
that a lot of these

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
algorithms arguably all of these

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
algorithms they can be seen as

293
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,959
minimizing free energy

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,000
um

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
and so we without getting

296
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
deeply into that um i think the moral of

297
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
the story is that

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
a lot of the things that working in

299
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
machine learning

300
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
are special cases of minimizing free

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
energy so of doing some kind of base and

302
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
inference

303
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
and so many of these problems you can

304
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
think of them as like special cases of

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
base and inference

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
so i think if you come from machine

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
learning

308
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
then would be quite natural to say

309
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
or at least you could say oh

310
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
approximate inference or free energy

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
minimization

312
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,959
is the most general thing you can do in

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,399
machine learning

314
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
and therefore since the brain engages in

315
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
some kind of cognition

316
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,640
it seems reasonable to assume that it

317
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,079
may be doing some kind of basin

318
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,360
difference

319
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
an approximate base inference so

320
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
minimizing free energy is the most

321
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
general way to look at it so that's one

322
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
way to get to a free energy principle

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
but maybe it's not very convincing so i

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
think

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
the other

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,519
the other way you could get to a free

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
energy principle

328
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,240
um which is more grounded in physics

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
and i think that was like um the content

330
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
of the original papers

331
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
is that if you look at a system that

332
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
persists over time

333
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,399
um

334
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,519
so a system that does not dissipate

335
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,079
then you can show

336
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,680
that it has to be optimizing something

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
um

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
and there and then you

339
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
there has to be optimizing some what

340
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
people call model evidence

341
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
so the this system must have like uh

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,639
implicitly or explicitly a model of its

343
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
environment

344
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,639
and it has to be optimizing in order not

345
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
to dissipate it has to be optimizing

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
that model

347
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
and then you can show that

348
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,880
um

349
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
actually minimizing free energy enables

350
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
you to do that

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,560
so i think that's the the other way um

352
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,800
anyway so so what we did in this paper

353
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
is we we took this intuition

354
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
of what it means to persist

355
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
so so we

356
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
there's like actually a clear way of

357
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
thinking about those things in uh in

358
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,279
mathematics and stochastic processes

359
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,880
so what we do in this paper is we look

360
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
at systems that persist over time

361
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
and

362
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
we also look at systems so that's the

363
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
first assumption and then the second

364
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
assumption

365
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,240
is that the system has to be separated

366
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,279
by a boundary with its environment

367
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
and i think i mean intuitively it makes

368
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,959
sense because we we're looking at

369
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,959
systems that are bounded

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,480
uh with their environment so they

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
interact

372
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
via a markup blanket but they cannot mix

373
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
per se with the system it's not like

374
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
milk and coffee if you wish

375
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
it's like a person in an environment so

376
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,440
it's

377
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
well defined in space

378
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
um so these are the two things that we

379
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,680
assume in this paper and then we show

380
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
that

381
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
you can actually

382
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
describe the system as minimizing free

383
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
energy in some way

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,720
thanks for that it's interesting about

385
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,199
the machine learning branch towards the

386
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
fep and then the physics branch because

387
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,839
of course there's also sort of the third

388
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
leg of that triangle with the physics

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
and machine learning so

390
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,120
we go from that just a interdisciplinary

391
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
connection or an interface

392
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,480
to add in the third which is this active

393
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
inference or the free energy type

394
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,399
framings and all of a sudden some of the

395
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
ideas that were a little bit hard to to

396
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,040
map from machine learning and physics

397
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
kind of come around the horn and maybe

398
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,279
there's a way that we can

399
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
see active inference playing a role

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
there so again anyone can just raise

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
their hand if they have a question or

402
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,839
write a question in the live chat

403
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,600
here's the road map

404
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
so these were the sections of the paper

405
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,959
which

406
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,880
introduced that boundedness notion of

407
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
the markov blanket

408
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
discussed basic mechanics active

409
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
inference and stochastic control and

410
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
then had a nice discussion and

411
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
conclusion with a few

412
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,600
supplemental sections so

413
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
what went into how you laid out the

414
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
arguments or

415
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
what sections do you think were um

416
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
condensed or which ones would you want

417
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
to expand on more so first just to the

418
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
authors on that and then avo your

419
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
question

420
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,990
hello lance and

421
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,440
[Music]

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
wait commer

423
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
i have a question uh before we get into

424
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
detail i'm curious whether you were

425
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,199
aware

426
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,800
of the kind of criticism that an

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
activist launched at the french

428
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,639
principle in suffocation in cognitive

429
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
science

430
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,279
right could you mention what what

431
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,160
specific criticism we're talking about

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
okay so i'm referring to the paper

433
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,680
laying down a path by di paolo

434
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
thomson and beer

435
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,120
um there is a lot of criticism that is

436
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,079
just

437
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,560
completely out

438
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
unrelated to anything that uh acting

439
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
says but the core

440
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
thing that seems relevant to me

441
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,440
is the role of creation and historicity

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,240
and

443
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
well self-creation

444
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,000
in cognition intelligence and life

445
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,040
so yeah the paper just i'm going to put

446
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
it in the chat is laying down a forking

447
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,600
path incompatibilities between an action

448
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
and the free energy

449
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
principle so

450
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,720
first to the authors for any thoughts on

451
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
that and then see stephen with a hand

452
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,279
raised

453
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
right um

454
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
so so i haven't read this particular

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,959
paper

456
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,920
um

457
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
so i i can i can't give you an answer

458
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,639
that's specific to this particular paper

459
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,720
um i would say

460
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
i would say from a general point of view

461
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
so yeah there's a lot of criticism on

462
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
the free energy principle

463
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,160
and i think it's natural because the

464
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
free energy principle aims to be

465
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
seems to be very general it's also an

466
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
extremely ambitious

467
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,520
um in in regards to to the criticism so

468
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,959
far

469
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,119
it's it's either been on the on the

470
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,480
mathematics

471
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
and so this is something that we've

472
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
fixed with the with the current paper so

473
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
i think a lot of the mathematical

474
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
criticism in the literature

475
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
is void

476
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
i mean is rendered void by by this paper

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
and there are there are other um

478
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,840
i would say philosophical criticisms uh

479
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
on the free energy principle so it's not

480
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,280
something i'm

481
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
expert about because i'm i'm a

482
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
mathematician so i wouldn't be able to

483
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,559
to really debate about the philosophy

484
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,559
here

485
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,400
um i i so i i'm not aware of

486
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,960
like uh daniel you said you put the link

487
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,039
to the paper in the chat oh i'll put it

488
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
in this i'll put it in the jitsi chat in

489
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
just a second okay because i i meant i

490
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
noticed you mentioned the words like

491
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,280
creation and historicity

492
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
um i'm not aware of the particular

493
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
argument but an argument that

494
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,080
i've heard against the free energy

495
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
principle that reminds me of what you

496
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
just said and this is one of the more

497
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
philosophical arguments not the

498
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
mathematical things that lance just

499
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
mentioned is the idea that

500
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
the free energy principle the inference

501
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,280
interpretation of a system with a markup

502
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
blanket at steady state it rests on the

503
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
idea of a steady state so basically

504
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
there's an invariant measure of the

505
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
system over time

506
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,080
and when people have tried to say relate

507
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
or claim that something like societies

508
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
or

509
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
large-scale socio-cultural or

510
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,919
socio-technical systems are engaging in

511
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,160
free energy you kind of have to enforce

512
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
this assumption of a stationary uh a

513
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
stationary steady-state distribution on

514
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
the system

515
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
and so when you say things like

516
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
historicity i think of like revolutions

517
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
or something right so that kind of

518
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200
things where the the kind of intrinsic

519
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
nature of the system seems to shatter or

520
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,360
fundamentally change and that would seem

521
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,799
to question

522
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,840
um

523
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
the or violate the steady-state

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
assumption which is kind of a baseline

525
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,360
thing you need in order for the free

526
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
energy principle maths to apply

527
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
um i can respond to that argument but i

528
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
don't actually know if that's the

529
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
argument laid out in this paper that's

530
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
just kind of what my brain jumped to

531
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,919
when you mention things like historicity

532
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,799
and

533
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,480
creation and destruction

534
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
is that is that the the core of the

535
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,039
argument though or

536
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
uh so thing like a revolution is not

537
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
necessarily a sign of historicity it can

538
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
be a predetermined in the um

539
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,320
in the formulation of the dynamical

540
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
system but uh

541
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
what i'm speaking about in the medical

542
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,240
terms is the presence of the of

543
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
difficulties that will be reversible if

544
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
for example uh we have we drive on the

545
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,919
uh where am i right of the road because

546
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,480
uh some guy said so like 200 years ago

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
and this

548
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,640
does not leave the law ever this is an

549
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
example of uh

550
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
walking

551
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
or path dependency or historicity

552
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,679
uh so that is the kind of argument that

553
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
di paulo and thompson and beer are

554
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
averaging

555
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,120
but it is um formally not proportionate

556
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
because advocacy does not entail the

557
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,679
absence of historicity

558
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
it's bernoulli systems that do not show

559
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
historicity ergotic system only do not

560
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,960
show like irreversible

561
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,039
transitions which is a much quicker

562
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,080
condition

563
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
but where

564
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
there is a convergence

565
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,480
to a better argument is that

566
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
to have a space or description of a

567
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
dynamical system you have to assume as

568
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
you assume

569
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
wait

570
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
english is broken assume that this space

571
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,559
is

572
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,240
fixed throughout the evolution of a

573
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,240
system and if we agree with an activists

574
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
and a system biologists like kaufman and

575
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
montebell and

576
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,159
metro monteville

577
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,360
that

578
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
core property of the integrity system is

579
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,559
to uh well make sense uh to find

580
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
observables and to create solutions to

581
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
problems did not exist

582
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
beforehand then the um

583
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
the stat space is not fixed it's created

584
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
along the systems evolution this is not

585
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,000
something you can account with a

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
stat space description of chemical

587
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,880
system

588
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
uh that has a state attractive state

589
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,520
distribution sorry

590
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah i i think i would agree that

591
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
as it currently stands the free energy

592
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
principle couldn't deal the math

593
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,720
couldn't deal with um varying state

594
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,600
spaces where literally the actual

595
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,840
interpretations or like the the finite

596
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
dimensionality of the system states is

597
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
changing over time usually you assume

598
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
some fixed integer dimension for all the

599
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
stochastic processing stuff although i'm

600
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,000
maybe lance could comment on that i'm

601
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,159
sure that could potentially be extended

602
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,000
to infinite dimensional like partial

603
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
differential equation style formulations

604
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,559
but uh based i if i understood you

605
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,600
correctly the first part of what you

606
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
said about path dependence and

607
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,799
irreversibility

608
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,240
that is all totally acute uh

609
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
accommodated by the maths laid out in

610
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,799
lance's paper so there's a very you know

611
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
strong part of the flow that is

612
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,720
irreversible another way of describing

613
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
that as you could say there's a strong

614
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
degree of path dependence in the

615
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
trajectories of the system so path

616
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,960
dependence per se is totally

617
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,159
accommodated

618
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,559
and easily um you know path dependent

619
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
systems can can fit into the free energy

620
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
framework but the state space changing

621
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
itself over time that's something that i

622
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
haven't really even thought about um

623
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
it's an interesting argument but i i

624
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
would agree that i don't think the free

625
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
energy principle currently is equipped

626
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
to deal with like the state space itself

627
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
being altered over time that's usually

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
assumed to be fixed but i don't know

629
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,080
maybe lance has a different opinion on

630
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
that

631
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,799
right um yeah i completely agree with

632
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,600
conor so in this paper we don't discuss

633
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
changing state spaces

634
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,159
and i think in terms of future work that

635
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,520
would be really

636
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
really the next step

637
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
um so so i think the the current

638
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
formulation

639
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
uh gives a mathematical framework to

640
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
think about adapting systems

641
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
but it doesn't

642
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,600
um

643
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
it doesn't really talk about

644
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
like environments that structurally

645
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,760
change over time for example

646
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
thanks um steven and then we can

647
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
continue on on this

648
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
i think this also speaks to that the

649
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
legs of that stool that was being talked

650
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,159
about earlier if you're coming from a

651
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,840
math and machine learning you've got

652
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
um

653
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
you know you've got more

654
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,919
lower dimensional approaches but they

655
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
show the principles and then when you

656
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
get into the inactive approaches

657
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,720
they're looking more from a biological

658
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
perspective

659
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,960
so it might also be a little bit around

660
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,080
the very high complexity but the my

661
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
understanding is that

662
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
the

663
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
dependency and ergodicity and also the

664
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
ability to do approximation

665
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
science

666
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,159
uh interpretations of the machine

667
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,200
learning

668
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
does start to make

669
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
this math

670
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,679
overcome some of those limitations um

671
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,720
because it it has more

672
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
i i i that's my understanding is that

673
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,159
the the reliance on ergodicity is not as

674
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,039
rigid now

675
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,000
so

676
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,039
let's

677
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,600
go to the markov blanket and then return

678
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
to some of these important distinctions

679
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,799
like ergotic systems steady state

680
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,159
stationary

681
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,080
so i'm gonna put the uh markov blanket

682
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,960
up through time figure three um figure

683
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,760
one has just sort of the the timeless

684
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,679
the classic blanket and then figure

685
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,559
three

686
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,120
is adding a subscript t

687
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,039
so having that

688
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,520
uh those variables describe time

689
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
dependent functions since that's kind of

690
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
what we're talking about with the

691
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
dynamical systems

692
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,799
so maybe

693
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
to the authors like how do you

694
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
summarize what this graphical figure

695
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
means what is it being what is being

696
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,960
blanketed what does it mean to blankets

697
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
and then how does that relate to steady

698
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
state or stationary distributions which

699
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,039
are in the title of the paper

700
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
right

701
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
so the the mark of blanket is really the

702
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,039
way the mathematical way in which you

703
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
you talk about boundaries

704
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,080
um

705
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,159
and so having a markup blanket simply

706
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,720
means that the internal states here

707
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
they're separated by

708
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
they're separated from the external

709
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,799
states by the blanket states

710
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,760
and then

711
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
the fact that uh the system is at steady

712
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,799
state uh means that the the blanket

713
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
persists over time

714
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,159
and so this is really the two things

715
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
that we need when we're talking about

716
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
um a biological system

717
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,400
or or a stone

718
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
so we need we need something internal

719
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
to the stone or the biological system

720
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,320
something external and then some kind of

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
interface

722
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,880
and of course when you're talking about

723
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
something very simple like a stone it's

724
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,400
not very interesting because you don't

725
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,440
have

726
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,679
any exchanges between what's internal

727
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,039
and external

728
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,360
via the blanket but when you're talking

729
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,159
about biological systems like like cells

730
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,400
or or bacillus you do have exchanges

731
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
of matter of energy and information and

732
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,240
that's something that you can

733
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,919
accommodate with the markup blanket

734
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,320
that's

735
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,200
it's almost a tension in the definition

736
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,520
of boundedness which is you said well

737
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
there is a boundary but then also it's

738
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,480
exchanging matter energy information

739
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
so what

740
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,640
is the boundaries meaning

741
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,919
uh if those are allowed to pass through

742
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,440
it conor and then anyone else

743
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,720
uh i'm unmuted right no no you're good

744
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
i'm good okay yeah yeah so i would uh i

745
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,240
would say

746
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
that's a great question because

747
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,960
basically the the boundary we're talking

748
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
about isn't when you take a boundary for

749
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
like a physical system people often

750
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,360
make assumptions about causality so that

751
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
something on one side of the blanket

752
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,399
can't affect something on the other side

753
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,679
of the blanket but because of this

754
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,520
exchange of matter and energy across the

755
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
blanket the the actual definition of the

756
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,320
markup blanket is a statistical one it

757
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,559
just means that this boundary

758
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,679
is

759
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,679
statistically in a sense segregates the

760
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,360
internal on the outside and and that

761
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
statistical separation can actually

762
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
critically differ from just direct

763
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
causal interactions so the actual

764
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,039
definition of the markov blink in a

765
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,559
statistical sense

766
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,200
is that the internal states when

767
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
conditioned

768
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
on the blanket states

769
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,240
are statistically independent of the

770
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,720
external states and vice versa the

771
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,559
external states when conditioned on

772
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,000
blanket states are statistically

773
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,720
independent of the internal states and

774
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
just saying that definition might not

775
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,039
make the intuition any more clear but

776
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,440
that really is all that it is

777
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
um so then when we actually look at the

778
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
dynamics of particular physical or

779
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,919
systems or stochastic processes

780
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,919
that statement cannot entail all kinds

781
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,360
of causal graphs and all kinds of

782
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
influences between those subsets

783
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
um it's really the statistical

784
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,720
independence

785
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
which which defines the boundary

786
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
um yeah so i think that's that's kind of

787
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,320
the kernel of the definition and for

788
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
certain kinds of statistical

789
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
distributions we can actually really

790
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,279
precisely look at the structure of

791
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
things like the stationary covariance

792
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,640
which is basically the covariance matrix

793
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
of the process at steady state and you

794
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,159
can read off

795
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,080
what systems are outside the blanket

796
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,760
what what subsets of variables outside

797
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
the blanket what subsets are inside the

798
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,360
blanket which subsets the variables are

799
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
the blanket

800
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
um so it's a really precise definition

801
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
that kind of

802
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
goes beyond whatever intuitions you

803
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,919
might bake into that on your own about

804
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,159
causality

805
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,399
awesome points so survival

806
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
sorry

807
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,120
does this not entail that blanket if

808
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
there is any causal interaction between

809
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
internal and external states then

810
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,559
blanket states would mediate this causal

811
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,880
interaction because if they did not then

812
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
you would have information that will go

813
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,760
directly from external to internal or

814
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
vice versa so um

815
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,760
settlement is correct then there is some

816
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
causal sense to blankets

817
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,320
is it correct or not

818
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,559
yeah yeah definitely and that's a really

819
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,600
good point

820
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
um so really what the blanket does

821
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
is uh to to separate the inside from the

822
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,919
outside statistically and so what that

823
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,279
means is that

824
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
any information

825
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
about the internal states that

826
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
any transmission of information on

827
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,559
anything about the internal states that

828
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,679
influences external states has to do

829
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,880
through the blanket states

830
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,399
um so there is a notion of causality but

831
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,840
but it's like they

832
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
as you said the internal and external

833
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
cannot affect each other directly they

834
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,600
have to do it through the blanket

835
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,799
okay thank you

836
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,279
awesome so dean

837
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,799
and then stephen

838
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,480
yeah this might be a strange question

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,200
but that's fine so the blank so the

840
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,039
blankets kind of we just use that as a

841
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,840
way of describing the interface my

842
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
question is and i cuz i

843
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,840
most of the math that you guys use is is

844
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,240
over my head but i appreciate that

845
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,679
you've been able to come up with it my

846
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,960
question is

847
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
we're thinking about this metaphorically

848
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
does the blanket

849
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,159
come with its own perforations i mean we

850
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,720
talk about it acting as a mediator but

851
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,159
is there a math that can kind of show

852
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,480
it's it's it's it's managing this

853
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
information flow back and forth but does

854
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,919
it already exist with these perforations

855
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,200
present or

856
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,799
is the how is the math going to tell us

857
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
how that that

858
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
medium works or is it did you guys

859
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,200
already explain that because maybe i

860
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
just didn't appreciate it when i read

861
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,720
the paper

862
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,600
um

863
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
yeah that's a really good question so we

864
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,159
didn't expand on that in the paper um

865
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,679
and so it's good that we talk about it

866
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,640
now

867
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
so

868
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
the definition of markup blanket

869
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
as it is taking the paper

870
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
allows for boundaries that are

871
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,159
completely opaque so without any kind of

872
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,799
transmission but also boundaries that

873
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,760
would let anything through

874
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
so

875
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,000
so it with this formalism is is quite

876
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
general um

877
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
and so far we don't make any assumptions

878
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,600
about the structure of the blanket and

879
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
so it could be very permeable not very

880
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,120
permeable

881
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,679
you could have all sorts of things

882
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
um and and i think that that's also

883
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,840
really interesting because

884
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,240
then i mean ultimately we want a theory

885
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,960
that describes biological systems and so

886
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,600
the blanket states have some degree of

887
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
permeability in

888
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
in in biological systems that we can

889
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,640
actually exploit mathematically

890
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,559
so we don't we don't do that here here

891
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,159
the blanket is

892
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,159
completely arbitrary and so you could

893
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,760
describe a stone but it could also

894
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,799
describe

895
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,919
maybe a brain or a rat or something like

896
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,960
this

897
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,399
but then in the future would be really

898
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,000
interesting to actually

899
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,519
impose some more structure on the

900
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,120
blanket to see whether we can say

901
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
anything more interesting about the

902
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
system that we're looking at

903
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
thanks

904
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,120
steven

905
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
i think this is a

906
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
an area that's probably going to be

907
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
growing a lot is how much of that

908
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,279
transfer

909
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,600
process of information from the infinite

910
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,679
almost external states

911
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,320
gets onto a blanket and then gets

912
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,720
transferred to the internal states

913
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
so the question is normally everyone

914
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
talks about changing the generative

915
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,279
model

916
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,279
but there is obviously a question what

917
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,720
what can you change in terms of the

918
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
blanket but i think

919
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
i don't think that's been

920
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
fully explored yet so but i think that's

921
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,360
a big area that

922
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,120
i suppose could be seen as part of the

923
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,799
generative model or the regime of

924
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,360
attention but

925
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,039
it sounds like this the mathematical

926
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,200
model here is starting to be able to

927
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,559
engage that more if it was expanded

928
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
yeah let's walk through a few

929
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,640
steps of the paper because that's really

930
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,559
where we're we're building up this

931
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,559
intuition or moving from the intuition

932
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,600
and scaffolding it with the math

933
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,679
so first you phrase

934
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
the blanket as intervening states

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,720
between internal and external states

936
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,039
and defined the state space

937
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,399
that those

938
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,159
different internal external and blanket

939
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
states can exist in so totally subject

940
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
to to servals

941
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,560
comments about state space

942
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,359
and

943
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
um maybe it'd be helpful to explain this

944
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,918
big pie so what is the covariance

945
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,119
precision

946
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,040
what are we talking about with these

947
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,320
matrices

948
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
what's a system with a certain type of

949
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
matrix structure that might help us get

950
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,879
a grasp on what the covariance matrix at

951
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
steady state is actually representing

952
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,359
about systems

953
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,560
right so so in the in our in our

954
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,599
scenario here the the matrix pi

955
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,320
actually encodes everything about um the

956
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,079
permeability of the branch of the

957
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,639
blanket but more generally

958
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,480
um how do the

959
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
internal states interact with blanket

960
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
states and how do the external states

961
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,560
interact with blanket state

962
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,960
so matrix spy really gives you

963
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
um yeah the structure of the interaction

964
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,920
and um

965
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
and yeah and so so we just simply showed

966
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
that the mark of blanket condition so

967
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,520
this boundary

968
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,760
actually is equivalent to some kind of

969
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,240
structure of the matrix by but then when

970
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,960
we try to differentiate um

971
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
living systems with non-living systems

972
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,560
and then intelligent systems from

973
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,119
non-intelligent systems then probably we

974
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,119
could say a lot more about this matrix

975
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,400
by

976
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,040
so like if there was non-zero everywhere

977
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,160
in pi

978
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
what would that correspond to or what

979
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,640
would it correspond to have all zeros

980
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
what does a big number or small number

981
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,480
mean in this precision matrix because

982
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
this is truly a key variable in these

983
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
formalisms

984
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,359
right

985
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,720
um

986
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,320
so so the

987
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,640
so one extreme would be the matrix by to

988
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,720
be the identity matrix

989
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,280
and then this would mean that

990
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,640
uh each state only interacts with itself

991
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,079
and so that that's like kind of an

992
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,079
extreme case of a markov blanket because

993
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,760
you have a boundary

994
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,119
but then you don't even have any

995
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,880
transmission with the boundary like you

996
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,440
have just three separate states external

997
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,359
blanket and internal that don't talk to

998
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,720
each other

999
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,920
and then the

1000
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,720
the other extreme would be to

1001
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
um to to have a non-zero non-zero entry

1002
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,079
in the in the equation that we have

1003
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,880
there

1004
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
and then it would mean that

1005
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,880
internal states and external states can

1006
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
talk to each other directly without

1007
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
interacting via the blanket scene so

1008
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,200
then you don't have a blanket you just

1009
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,280
have three states that mix with each

1010
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,079
other

1011
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,119
and so

1012
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,839
yeah you do you lose

1013
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,839
you lose kind of the the basic point

1014
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,079
that says oh we're looking at systems

1015
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,400
that have a boundary

1016
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
um and and then in terms of the the

1017
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
magnitude of the entries so a big

1018
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
magnitude

1019
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,880
would say um

1020
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,280
i think i may get get it the

1021
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
wrong way wrong way around but i think a

1022
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
big magnitude is like you have a lot of

1023
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
interaction and if you have a very low

1024
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,280
magnitude you have very little

1025
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,599
interaction

1026
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,400
okay

1027
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
great because this

1028
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,599
variable is important and this

1029
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
relationship between the one over the

1030
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
precision and the variance is gonna come

1031
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,839
up um a lot so we go from this idea of

1032
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,640
using a matrix to represent

1033
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,119
basically the statistical connectivity

1034
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,359
of different nodes and then hope that

1035
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,280
the structure of that matrix is such

1036
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,520
that it falls out or designing

1037
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,280
systems such that the structure of the

1038
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
matrix falls out into internal external

1039
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
and mediating blanket states

1040
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,359
and then

1041
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,079
you develop this notion that the

1042
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,400
that there's an expected

1043
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,800
uh internal state and external state

1044
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
that are downstream of the blanket

1045
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
states so what is happening with these

1046
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,880
formalisms or how can it be that the

1047
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,960
blanket state tells us about what to

1048
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
expect internally and externally

1049
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
um

1050
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
so because you have a because you have a

1051
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,680
boundary because you have these blanket

1052
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
states

1053
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
so so the whole

1054
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,960
um so let me give you an example

1055
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,599
uh if you think about a human

1056
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,359
then for example part of the blanket

1057
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,040
states would be what happens on your

1058
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,920
retina so the impression from the world

1059
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
that you get from in on the retina

1060
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
and so

1061
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,680
this is to say that if you have some

1062
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,760
kind of sensory impression on your

1063
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,000
retina then this gives you some

1064
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,599
information about what's going on

1065
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,119
outside

1066
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,800
and so

1067
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680
um if if on your retina you see kind of

1068
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,280
like a a certain shape maybe you you

1069
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
maybe

1070
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,400
the most like the thing that's going on

1071
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
in the environment that corresponds to

1072
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,079
that shape is a chair

1073
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,680
and maybe actually that shape that you

1074
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,599
see on your eyes like looks like a chair

1075
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,920
so then you would say oh the most likely

1076
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,359
external state

1077
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,720
is a chair

1078
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,440
um so this is all formalizing the fact

1079
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,680
that the blanket states

1080
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
what what you have on on your retina

1081
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,280
gives you information about what's going

1082
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,119
on outside

1083
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,440
and also influences what's going on in

1084
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
your brain because

1085
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,280
you need to process that information

1086
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,240
um

1087
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,800
and so yeah so we have a most likely

1088
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
external state and a most likely

1089
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,279
internal state

1090
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,839
any other

1091
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,079
um uh thoughts on this because then

1092
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,920
that's where we go from

1093
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
oh

1094
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,800
yes so connor go for it

1095
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,359
yeah i'll just add that uh

1096
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,880
it's critical that we're talking about

1097
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,839
expectations here so that's why

1098
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:42,800
we're

1099
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
writing down like a normal distribution

1100
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
that's centered on this expectation

1101
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,839
because remember these are stochastic

1102
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,040
processes so for any given blanket state

1103
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
it doesn't mean that the internal state

1104
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,119
on the other that directly is downstream

1105
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,720
of that blanket state will always be

1106
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
that expected one but this is just the

1107
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
mean of the distribution but the

1108
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,480
powerful thing about this uh the

1109
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
bayesian mechanics for these uh gaussian

1110
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
processes

1111
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,160
is that those um expected states are

1112
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
basically just linear functions of the

1113
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,319
blanket states just given by these sub

1114
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,079
matrices of the covariance and then

1115
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,160
their inverses and such like that so

1116
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,319
it's just important to know that if

1117
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,240
we're to pursue this example of the

1118
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
retina it's like

1119
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
for any given retinal impression it

1120
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,880
doesn't mean there's always going to be

1121
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,440
the same cortical response right in

1122
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,000
visual cortex or what have you but

1123
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
there's going to be some distribution of

1124
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,280
cortical responses and what we're

1125
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
talking about right here is the mean of

1126
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,760
that distribution

1127
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,720
very

1128
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,520
good point so steven and then anyone

1129
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,800
else with a raised hand and then we'll

1130
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,359
move forward

1131
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,400
so

1132
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,560
from what is you're saying there with

1133
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,839
the

1134
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,160
stochastic

1135
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,880
processes is there's there's some

1136
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,520
transfer

1137
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
in a in a sort of a random kind of

1138
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
informational sense

1139
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
and obviously it's lossy as it goes

1140
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,440
through and it's the ex the expectations

1141
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,240
i suppose at some level have to have

1142
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
have to be able to be confirmed or

1143
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,200
disconfirmed or find some sort of

1144
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,839
um

1145
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,599
statistical correlation

1146
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,280
to then actually use the information

1147
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,640
that has to be i suppose at some point

1148
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,400
there's just not enough there

1149
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
to work anything out or the model's not

1150
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,720
good enough to find it

1151
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,440
i'll be interested in how much

1152
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,680
do you have a sense of how much

1153
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
tends to get through

1154
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,520
or like how long it takes for

1155
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,440
information to

1156
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,560
be processable like if that's if there's

1157
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,880
some sort of heuristic or whether that's

1158
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,480
a little bit too unrealistic

1159
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
yeah that's a really great question i

1160
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,280
mean in the in the brain there's

1161
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,119
evidence that you know

1162
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,280
you can get pretty complex i'm not a

1163
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,520
vision neuroscientist but you can get

1164
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,119
pretty deep in the cortical hierarchy

1165
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,440
even up to the level of a decision

1166
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,079
within you know 150 or sometimes less

1167
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,359
milliseconds

1168
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,000
um so that's almost kind of so this is

1169
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
another big important thing to discuss

1170
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,000
about this paper is

1171
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
the information processing we're talking

1172
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,520
about here is on the level of

1173
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,240
expectations right so if the brain is

1174
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,119
really

1175
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,960
processing like an immediate retinal

1176
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,040
impression it doesn't have time to

1177
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,000
average across a ton of no like tons of

1178
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,640
parallel noise realizations

1179
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,359
like

1180
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,359
and then and then use the expected value

1181
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,960
to actually do its processing this so

1182
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
the the brain in any given moment is

1183
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,319
actually just getting stochastic

1184
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,400
realizations and then it's using

1185
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,599
information processing on those

1186
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,800
realizations

1187
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,880
so i would also i don't know how lance

1188
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,640
feels about this but i would hesitate in

1189
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,920
reading in like the expected

1190
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,760
cortical state given a particular

1191
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,079
blanket state i would i would with

1192
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,839
restraint from reading that as the

1193
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,520
informational currency that the brain

1194
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,119
actually works with

1195
00:42:59,119 --> 00:42:59,920
um

1196
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
so there is information uh transfer but

1197
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,079
it's not like the brain always has to

1198
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
work with expectations it can work with

1199
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,880
um stochastic samples

1200
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
at any given moment but that's also like

1201
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,720
a controversial thing in

1202
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,240
in neuroscience right now it's like what

1203
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,760
is the actual information the brain is

1204
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,200
working with but the fact that the

1205
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
latency on decision making can be so

1206
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,280
short suggests that the brain isn't

1207
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
really averaging over a bunch of

1208
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,800
parallel realizations of something in

1209
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,839
order to do a computation

1210
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,359
another piece is that on this slide

1211
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,280
we're talking about the expectation in

1212
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,240
terms of the the mean the average value

1213
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,079
of a distribution conditioned upon

1214
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,839
blanket states we're talking about

1215
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,200
average value

1216
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,560
of internal states conditioned on

1217
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,520
blanket states we haven't yet introduced

1218
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
this question about internal states

1219
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,079
expecting or making a prediction about

1220
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,040
external states so it's almost like

1221
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,240
expectation is being used um as just the

1222
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,319
sort of broad statistical concept that

1223
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,480
you can condition expectation on some

1224
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,720
other variables or

1225
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,480
the systems that we kind of care about

1226
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,400
and are interested in the ones where the

1227
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,800
internal states are acting as if they

1228
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,079
are

1229
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,319
making expectations or predictions about

1230
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,079
external states which is where

1231
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,000
it's taken in the immediate following

1232
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,640
section of the paper

1233
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
that's a really good point yeah

1234
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,280
what is the sigma

1235
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,400
function so i know there's some related

1236
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
um work

1237
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,720
uh like with miguel that we saw a little

1238
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,240
bit about like

1239
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,079
what is the sigma what kinds of

1240
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,440
gaps in the formalism does the sigma

1241
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,720
cover

1242
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,920
um

1243
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
how did it come to be this way with the

1244
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,440
mapping function and what does it

1245
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,440
reflect

1246
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,000
right um so i would say that the sigma

1247
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
is the most

1248
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,800
fundamental

1249
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
ingredient to get to the free energy

1250
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,839
principle

1251
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,839
because ultimately we want to be able to

1252
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,160
save uh what we want to be able to say

1253
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,599
or or say

1254
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,839
say that happens or or doesn't happen is

1255
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,720
that

1256
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,480
the internal states have some kind of

1257
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,760
representation about the external states

1258
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,599
uh and so the way to get there is to

1259
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,760
actually have a sigma function

1260
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,800
that

1261
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,960
gives that maps from the

1262
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
expected internal state or expected

1263
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,960
cortical response

1264
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,160
to

1265
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,400
the expected external state like what's

1266
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,560
going on around you

1267
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,200
so there there needs to be some

1268
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,920
uh we need we need to find uh like a

1269
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,240
relationship between internal states and

1270
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,480
external states to be able to say

1271
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,720
anything about inference

1272
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,920
and so what what we do in in this paper

1273
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,119
is we give

1274
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,480
conditions

1275
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,440
under which um you you have this mapping

1276
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,800
sigma

1277
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,040
and then you you're able to say oh we

1278
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,599
have some kind of inference going on

1279
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,400
and

1280
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,040
i think in in terms of like a historical

1281
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
perspective

1282
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,200
so in previous papers the the sigma was

1283
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,640
assumed

1284
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,960
um and then and then miguel wrote this

1285
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,520
paper saying oh the sigma

1286
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,680
uh you need some assumptions to for the

1287
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,440
sigma to work it doesn't it doesn't

1288
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,800
always

1289
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,200
uh sigma doesn't always exist

1290
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,520
and so what we do in this paper is we we

1291
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
give conditions under which sigma exists

1292
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,599
and if these conditions fail and sigma

1293
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,119
doesn't exist

1294
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,960
and crucially i think

1295
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,119
these conditions can be verified from

1296
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,520
data

1297
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,720
great

1298
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,839
points here

1299
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,720
um the

1300
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
synchronization map and a few of these

1301
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,440
other pieces relate to

1302
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,040
the idea of an image

1303
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,560
and a kernel

1304
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,280
so

1305
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
maybe it'd be helpful to learn a little

1306
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
bit about what what are the image and

1307
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,000
the kernel reflecting i found one

1308
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,440
representation

1309
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,680
about mapping the the uh two different

1310
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,920
spaces to each other using that sort of

1311
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,400
kernel and image notation but when

1312
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,839
you're talking about um in lemma 2.1 the

1313
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,680
existence of the sigma function

1314
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,359
entailing

1315
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,839
an image function that maps the internal

1316
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,079
to the external states like what is an

1317
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,040
image

1318
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,319
what is the difference between just the

1319
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,319
variable in itself versus an image of it

1320
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,839
or a kernel of it

1321
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,480
right so what we're trying to do is to

1322
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,800
to map the expected internal state to

1323
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,359
the expected external state

1324
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,359
and so what we mean by image in the

1325
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,040
first line here

1326
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,800
is is simply that

1327
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,319
yeah we're we're trying to map variables

1328
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,319
that could be your expected cortical

1329
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,079
responses so we don't care about

1330
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,280
anything

1331
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,200
that's not your expected political

1332
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,119
response where

1333
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,800
so we care about specific type of

1334
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
variables

1335
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,440
um

1336
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,960
and then we're trying to map these to

1337
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,280
expected external states so so that's

1338
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,559
the first line

1339
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,480
and so then here we

1340
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,720
we just say that basically the the gist

1341
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,440
of this result is that

1342
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,720
if

1343
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,400
if you have something that's going on in

1344
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,920
the environment let's say there's a

1345
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,599
chair in front of you and you get some

1346
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,880
kind of expected cortical response

1347
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,720
and then let's suppose there's a sofa in

1348
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,800
front of you and you get the ex the same

1349
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,599
expected political response

1350
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,079
then you will have a problem because it

1351
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,760
means that your organism cannot

1352
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,880
differentiate between chairs and sofas

1353
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,319
because it has the same cortical

1354
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,880
response for the for the two

1355
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,280
two different external states

1356
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,760
and so what we're saying is that we

1357
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,839
actually don't want that to happen

1358
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,240
we want our organism to be able to

1359
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,200
differentiate between different external

1360
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
states

1361
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,160
and so this is

1362
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,720
um the the condition three and the

1363
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,240
conditions for

1364
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,319
uh they're both i mean each of them is

1365
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,880
equivalent to one and so it puts on the

1366
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,520
mathematical footing what it means to be

1367
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,680
able to differentiate between

1368
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,130
different states in the environment

1369
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,280
[Music]

1370
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,520
awesome thank you um serval and then

1371
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,680
we'll ask a question from the live chat

1372
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,599
so

1373
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,319
for this thing to work you need organism

1374
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,720
to be able to discriminate between any

1375
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
two states of its environment is that

1376
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,359
correct

1377
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,960
um yeah so any two states that we model

1378
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,400
not necessarily

1379
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,720
um

1380
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,240
yes i see that mapping like four b1 and

1381
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,040
b2 being equal to each other

1382
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,040
then it implies that the that the

1383
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,480
external predictions are going to be the

1384
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,760
same

1385
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,839
yeah so if your expected cortical

1386
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,680
responses are the same

1387
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,760
then the expected states must be the

1388
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,720
same

1389
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,920
um so then again okay

1390
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,839
this needs to be thought about in terms

1391
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,680
of representations

1392
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,880
so the the external world does not need

1393
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,440
to be model modeled at the molecular

1394
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
level so it's like

1395
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,520
a model about the external world and so

1396
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,040
maybe

1397
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,240
in that model there there's things

1398
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,760
yeah so so it can be like a coarse

1399
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,079
grained model of the external world

1400
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,800
okay so you use the example of a chair

1401
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,839
in your sofa i'm pretty sure that

1402
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,520
most of the listening people can do the

1403
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
difference they're pretty sure that most

1404
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,119
cats cannot

1405
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,240
well i said a cat i fly it's smaller

1406
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,200
why would a certain organism develop

1407
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,400
representation of certain states under

1408
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,880
the cringey principle

1409
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,440
um so that that's a really good point

1410
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
and i think to

1411
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,640
to address that mathematically we would

1412
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,480
need to

1413
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,640
to actually investigate

1414
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,000
a state space that changes over time

1415
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,760
to actually to actually address the

1416
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,079
question of how how things learn

1417
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,760
representations

1418
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
so that's not that's not what

1419
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,160
uh we haven't done that far that far yet

1420
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,800
but that's definitely an important thing

1421
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,839
to to address in the future so what we

1422
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,559
the the starting point here is

1423
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,400
you start with a steady state you start

1424
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,319
with a markov blanket

1425
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,880
and you have uh so the representation is

1426
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,160
already baked in in the markov blanket

1427
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,480
and and so in the in this result we just

1428
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,800
say oh if the mark of blanket looks like

1429
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,760
this

1430
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,000
then you have a good representation

1431
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,400
if the markup blanket is uh sort of more

1432
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,760
degenerate then you have a bad

1433
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,040
representation

1434
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,200
so in the in the next slide actually um

1435
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,920
um

1436
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
if you can put up the next slide

1437
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,160
um so we show that if the if the

1438
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,160
condition from the previous slide is not

1439
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,200
met

1440
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
then you then the organism would have a

1441
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,040
degenerate type of representation where

1442
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,960
for example it cannot differentiate

1443
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,079
between cats and between uh chairs and

1444
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,160
and sofas

1445
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,880
and and that that i suppose is still

1446
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,200
fine uh but it's

1447
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,640
um

1448
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,800
so so yeah it would like conflate

1449
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,200
complete different external states

1450
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,839
um so in this paper we assume that this

1451
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,839
wouldn't happen because then it enables

1452
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,880
you to

1453
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,839
like derive results exactly

1454
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,000
but you could assume that um the

1455
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,920
organism conflates

1456
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,520
different things and then you would have

1457
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,359
some kind of semi-degenerate type of

1458
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,720
representation

1459
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,400
and then everything still carries out

1460
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
but instead of saying oh

1461
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,960
my organism does exact basic inference

1462
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,359
and it's like super accurate and so on

1463
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,440
uh you can only

1464
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,079
um you can only say oh my organism maybe

1465
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,920
is doing some kind of approximate

1466
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,319
inference that's good in some instances

1467
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,800
and bad in some other instances

1468
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,000
so i think

1469
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,359
um you can definitely relax relax that

1470
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,599
condition and sort of assess and

1471
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,960
directly

1472
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
how accurate is your representation

1473
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,400
okay

1474
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,040
to reformulate any representation must

1475
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,720
have a precursor sensory active state in

1476
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,359
this framework

1477
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,400
okay very interesting and also we're

1478
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,599
still in the um inference section we

1479
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,520
haven't introduced

1480
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,000
policy planning or planning as inference

1481
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,800
so it doesn't need to be the perfect

1482
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,960
state estimator in order to make

1483
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,359
adequate policy so

1484
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,680
we've talked about that in many other

1485
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,359
situations about action and loop and

1486
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,359
everything so let's

1487
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,800
look through the paper and then as we

1488
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,280
build in pieces we can see where these

1489
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,960
these different segments come into play

1490
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,160
because we haven't talked about like

1491
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,240
policy or conditioning inference on

1492
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,800
policy yet so stephen and then i'll ask

1493
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,599
the question from the chat

1494
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,480
one thing that can also help think about

1495
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,920
expectations and simplify or or

1496
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,359
get away from the pressure of

1497
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,680
representations is

1498
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,119
that

1499
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,839
the the blanket can be seen more like or

1500
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,160
the perception visual perception is more

1501
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
like an impressionist painter

1502
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,440
painting

1503
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,480
dabs

1504
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,079
on a painting and then stepping out and

1505
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,520
looking at it and we're just continually

1506
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,440
like trying to find the textures and the

1507
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,520
patterns in

1508
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,160
that might help confirm our expectations

1509
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,880
rather than it being like we see

1510
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,440
the shape of the object it could be that

1511
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,800
as long as we've seen the type of

1512
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,000
textures

1513
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,800
um that we're feeling in the space

1514
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,640
um and that that some of that could be

1515
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,880
done at the retina level there could be

1516
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
certain things that just gets processed

1517
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,079
so i i suppose just couching that in the

1518
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,280
inactivist

1519
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
world of you know really

1520
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,160
when we say representation that's a bit

1521
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,440
unloaded in that world so it could be

1522
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,280
statistically

1523
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,240
uh

1524
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,119
predictable in some way

1525
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,960
yep and we've talked about

1526
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,119
representation and some of the different

1527
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,520
views on representation and

1528
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,000
axial constants uh work on the the

1529
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,319
armstis and the representation war

1530
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,680
so blue's question before we continue on

1531
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,119
with exploring the formalism blue asked

1532
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,200
uh do the maths that you have been

1533
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
working with allow for altering the

1534
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,119
structure or boundary of the blanket

1535
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,000
itself for example if i go blind that

1536
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,720
sensory state is no longer available

1537
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,280
so how do we deal which is a little bit

1538
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,880
we addressed earlier but there's like

1539
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,839
different

1540
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,680
senses that the models can be changing

1541
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,599
they can be within the box

1542
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,280
changing at steady state

1543
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,119
or there are these other types of

1544
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,559
changes that actually change the

1545
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,160
structure of

1546
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,240
the whole boundary or the internal model

1547
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,040
itself so what kinds of changes

1548
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,200
violate the model and which kinds of

1549
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,680
changes are allowing us to continue

1550
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,399
using the model

1551
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,599
so uh

1552
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,359
at the moment um

1553
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,760
what the what this paper accommodates

1554
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,559
are

1555
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,319
sudden changes in the blanket so you

1556
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,079
could at any point change change the

1557
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,720
blanket and then see what happens so if

1558
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,799
for example if you go blind you could

1559
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
change the blanket accordingly and

1560
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,440
and then everything would carry out

1561
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,599
what this doesn't account for is

1562
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,920
blankets that continuously change over

1563
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,040
time

1564
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,880
so for example if you're looking at an

1565
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,280
organism throughout its lifetime

1566
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
the organism would

1567
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,599
after being born it would like grow and

1568
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,040
age and so on

1569
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,520
um so we do not accommodate that

1570
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,319
but we we can accommodate sudden changes

1571
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,240
in the nine kids

1572
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,720
awesome thank you and also just anytime

1573
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,920
people need to drop off is totally cool

1574
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,599
so let's

1575
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,680
take another look at that

1576
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,440
markov blanket persisting through time

1577
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,559
and

1578
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,359
maybe even return a little bit to what

1579
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,599
kinds of systems are we talking about

1580
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,880
here

1581
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,200
there was this very interesting piece in

1582
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,520
example 3.1

1583
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,680
about describing which types of

1584
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,000
stochastic processes at the gaussian

1585
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,520
steady state p

1586
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,720
might fit under this phrasing

1587
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,119
so several things were mentioned

1588
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,480
conor how would you summarize this list

1589
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,880
or is this an exhaustive list is this

1590
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
just the tip of the iceberg what kinds

1591
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,760
of attributes do these examples share

1592
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,119
that allow them to fall under this

1593
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,920
framework and then what violates it and

1594
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,119
moves us into a different space

1595
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,559
yeah so this is um so basically the

1596
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,359
the the core set of stochastic processes

1597
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,119
that we we deal with in this paper are

1598
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,119
diffusion processes

1599
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,480
um so that's just a particular type of

1600
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,000
markov process

1601
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,839
which means that basically the

1602
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,680
current moment is totally

1603
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,599
uh statistically dependent on the last

1604
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,040
moment

1605
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,400
um that's not to say that there

1606
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,520
can't exist mathematics that uh apply

1607
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,119
the free energy principle to other sorts

1608
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,200
of stochastic processes that's probably

1609
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,960
something that lance is also working on

1610
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,000
at the moment

1611
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,280
but um

1612
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,680
if i was to give like some

1613
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,799
i mean

1614
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,640
markov prosthesis are very generic in

1615
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,640
the sense that tons of

1616
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,799
biological processes i think

1617
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,799
and non-biological processes could be

1618
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,359
cast as as markov processes

1619
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,359
and i think there's also an important

1620
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,839
aspect this is kind of

1621
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,000
touched uh on a little bit in the next

1622
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
section with integrator chains even

1623
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,680
though you might say oh but like humans

1624
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,280
have memory there's all kinds of deep

1625
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,200
temporal dependencies

1626
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,760
you can have very high dimensional

1627
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,920
markov processes where with with

1628
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,799
different

1629
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,599
levels of time scales but at the lowest

1630
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,359
level i think it's

1631
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,760
a safe mathematical assumption to make

1632
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,440
that things are markov process at the

1633
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,520
most fine grained level so i think that

1634
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,760
the these kinds of systems are

1635
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,079
like pretty unrestricted in the kinds of

1636
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,920
things they can capture everything you

1637
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
know from financial markets are modeled

1638
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,400
as diffusion processes the orange

1639
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,240
dynamic process which is what we use in

1640
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,319
this paper is a really popular

1641
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,720
um process used to model things like uh

1642
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,480
decision making like the drift diffusion

1643
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,799
process which is used in kind of

1644
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,559
alternative force choice decision making

1645
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,680
tasks

1646
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,280
um and then things like evolutionary

1647
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,040
dynamics like genetic frequencies

1648
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,200
drifting over time are modeled

1649
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,440
as a stochastic like linear diffusion

1650
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,799
processes

1651
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,760
um

1652
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,839
but i should also say that we use orange

1653
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:28,720
strength

1654
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,640
basically linear diffusions in this work

1655
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,160
and that's how we get these nice linear

1656
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,920
synchronization maps the mathematics are

1657
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,760
all linear and easy

1658
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,119
but uh this also applies to non-linear

1659
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,960
um diffusion processes so where the

1660
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,040
drift term basically isn't just a linear

1661
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,280
map like a b like a big matrix like it

1662
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,440
would be for an ou process but it could

1663
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
also be some non-linear

1664
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,040
very you know kind of

1665
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,400
harsh function

1666
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,559
um one some some other restrictions is

1667
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,799
that the drift function so basically the

1668
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,319
flow that

1669
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,160
determines the motion of the next set of

1670
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,559
states given the current state that mo

1671
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,400
that drift function has to be smooth

1672
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
that's another condition um in these

1673
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,079
kinds of diffusion processes

1674
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,960
um yeah that is i think i pretty much

1675
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,480
cover it there's like some technical

1676
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,000
things like a zigzag process i'm

1677
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,200
actually not sure what that is that's

1678
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,720
something to ask uh lance

1679
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,319
great thanks

1680
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,960
and what you said about that um the the

1681
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,440
multiple levels of integration with the

1682
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,280
integrator chains and about how that

1683
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,640
addresses some of the comments about

1684
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,079
historiosity um we can return to that

1685
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,480
because there's some i think it's really

1686
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,559
instructive so serval with a question

1687
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,160
and then anyone else who wants to ask

1688
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,799
one

1689
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,319
yeah i have a question which is

1690
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,520
mathematical in nature for a change

1691
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,880
um

1692
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,480
i don't get what this means for random

1693
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,640
nuclear systems to other three states if

1694
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,240
it is not ergotic because if it is

1695
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,559
ergodic then due to well erasity

1696
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,200
you can find a measure that says

1697
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,079
something about how likely i am to find

1698
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,880
a system in such or such

1699
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,799
subspace you should not have the

1700
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,400
hybridic conditions and you cannot

1701
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,040
exchange a distribution for time average

1702
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,480
i don't get

1703
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,319
where what

1704
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,799
where the distribution is coming from

1705
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,599
exactly in the case uh where the system

1706
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,079
is um

1707
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,480
kind of deterministic

1708
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,400
at least

1709
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,720
yeah i can't think of an example off the

1710
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,880
moment but there are processes that have

1711
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,640
an invariant measure

1712
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,400
where the time and the space averages

1713
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
are not equivalent so if you just look

1714
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,280
up

1715
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,920
non-ergotic stationary processes i think

1716
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,280
there's some

1717
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,960
examples with

1718
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,040
like discrete switching processes like

1719
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,119
um bernoulli variables

1720
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,880
where the the time and the space

1721
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,520
averages will actually not be equivalent

1722
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,839
so that so i think this

1723
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,559
is

1724
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,799
explicitly taking into account those

1725
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,720
those kinds of systems

1726
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,559
um where the time and the space average

1727
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,799
wouldn't be equivalent so

1728
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,480
for instance if you think about systems

1729
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,319
with multiple basins of attraction that

1730
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,079
might like stochastically jump between

1731
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,160
those two basins of attraction

1732
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,480
the space average there at any given

1733
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,880
moment will not necessarily be

1734
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,200
um equivalent like a bunch of parallel

1735
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,039
realizations at any given moment the

1736
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,720
space average of that might be centered

1737
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,359
around one of the modes of that process

1738
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,039
and that will actually be different than

1739
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,799
the time average which would actually

1740
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,640
give your distribution over both modes

1741
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,319
so that's just something that that jumps

1742
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,160
to mind but there are other examples of

1743
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,000
stationary processes

1744
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,760
where the space and time average are not

1745
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,200
equivalent which is the definition of

1746
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,280
ergodicity

1747
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,079
okay but uh how do you define this as

1748
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,640
the sorry steady state distribution then

1749
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,920
what does it mean and what are the

1750
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,280
conditions for it to be defined

1751
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,920
so a steady state distribution

1752
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,160
basically just means that the statistic

1753
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,319
the sufficient statistics that define it

1754
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,480
uh do not vary over time

1755
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,319
um so they're invariant they're constant

1756
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,920
basically

1757
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,880
um so

1758
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,200
for for a gaussian process the mean does

1759
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,799
not change over time

1760
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,799
and the covariance does not change over

1761
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,319
time

1762
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,559
so that's that's an example

1763
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,200
um yeah i mean so the the definition of

1764
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,440
the stationary state actually if

1765
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,960
if you get down to the fundamentals of

1766
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,720
it i would more say the stationary state

1767
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,880
is actually just a property of the flow

1768
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,559
so the flow that the stochastic

1769
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,079
differential equation itself like the

1770
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,240
ito style differential equation that's

1771
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,920
the most fundamental structure of any

1772
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,960
system

1773
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,880
and the stationary state actually is

1774
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,760
just something whose gradients drive the

1775
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,119
flow

1776
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,039
so rather than um

1777
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,359
but but that's more an interpretational

1778
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,960
point but in terms of the actual okay

1779
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,680
stationary i guess so steady state

1780
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,160
okay but you have stationary i guess i

1781
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,839
know what stationary is and you have as

1782
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,000
a state which is defined if i understand

1783
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,319
well but distribution p

1784
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,079
the question is how do you define a

1785
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,319
distribution of a generical system in

1786
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,359
the general case of a stationary nickel

1787
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,960
system

1788
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,280
so the way you define it formally is you

1789
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,760
define basically the the a partial

1790
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,000
differential equation that tells you the

1791
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,640
density of the of the system at every

1792
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,880
time point and that partial differential

1793
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,400
equation is called the fock or planck

1794
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,640
operator and then you basically set the

1795
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,799
derivative of that partial differential

1796
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,039
equation equal to zero and then you

1797
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,640
solve for the density

1798
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,720
so that's the most like minimal bare

1799
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,400
bones definition i can give you of the

1800
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,760
of the steady state is the density which

1801
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,520
is the solution to the focker plank

1802
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,839
operator when the focker plank operates

1803
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,400
derivative with respect to time zero

1804
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,319
that's the stationary state so another

1805
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,319
way of saying that is if i start the

1806
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,920
stochastic process in a bunch of

1807
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,880
different places and run it over time

1808
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,280
all those processes will converge to the

1809
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,200
solution to the focker blank operator

1810
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,160
which is the the steady state density

1811
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,559
okay and for what kind of system do we

1812
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,559
have a stable solution

1813
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:01,839
for this

1814
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,119
rather than say uh

1815
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,400
i don't have the words original

1816
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,280
attractor something that switches and uh

1817
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,000
i don't know goes to uh

1818
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,359
new places like expensive process

1819
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,079
um yeah so the precise condition there's

1820
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,240
basically conditions on the drift that

1821
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,920
will tell you whether the system

1822
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,760
explodes or whether it converges so for

1823
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,920
instance for an ou process

1824
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,160
those solutions to the focker plank

1825
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,359
operator

1826
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,400
are

1827
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,319
defined when the eigen values of the

1828
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,920
drift matrix are not too big for

1829
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,039
instance

1830
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,119
but what the actual conditions are for

1831
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,960
all sorts of stochastic processes such

1832
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,319
that there are unique solutions to the

1833
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,799
focker plank operator i am i'm not sure

1834
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,559
i'm not an expert on

1835
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,640
uh on stochastic processes that's

1836
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,920
something that lance might be able to

1837
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,599
give a more rigorous definition to but

1838
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,599
it really depends on the drift um

1839
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,839
basically the f function which tells you

1840
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,079
whether the system has a invariant

1841
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,160
measure or basically a unique solution

1842
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,680
and sometimes there's multiple solutions

1843
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,839
to the focker blank operator which means

1844
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,200
that you know the system will end up in

1845
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,920
one thing or another

1846
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,200
thanks for these

1847
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,359
helpful explanations just one comment

1848
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,599
before dean's question is that sometimes

1849
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,559
the steady state can be at a higher

1850
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,400
moment so like in the example of a car

1851
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,839
there's like the position and then

1852
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,680
there's how fast it's moving and then

1853
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,240
etc higher and higher derivatives and so

1854
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,640
the integrator chains and variational

1855
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,119
inference allow us to find an invariance

1856
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,920
at a higher level of the distribution

1857
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,400
that even as the actual position of the

1858
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,319
car is changing like that a stationary

1859
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,760
process doesn't mean the car is not

1860
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,599
moving it just means there's something

1861
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,280
about the car's movement

1862
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,359
that we can continue to integrate or

1863
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,119
derive towards

1864
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,760
finding a statistical invariance

1865
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,400
specifically one that's structured kind

1866
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,760
of like this

1867
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,599
where it's almost like a diffusion

1868
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,920
process or a flow

1869
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,359
across a field

1870
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,799
so those are some of the pieces that

1871
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,280
link together and so it's not just that

1872
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,200
that the position has to be well behaved

1873
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,680
it might look very non-linear but we're

1874
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,599
using certain ways of breaking down the

1875
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,160
problem so that at each level we can

1876
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,559
frame it as this like linked

1877
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,359
sequence of tractable calculations

1878
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,400
so

1879
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,520
connor if you have anything to add on

1880
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,200
that or dean you can question yeah i

1881
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,039
think that's a really good point like uh

1882
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,480
so basically you can correct for a

1883
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,920
moving frame of reference through

1884
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,280
differentiation

1885
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,119
and that's kind of the basis of these

1886
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,400
integrator chains is something that

1887
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,559
might be a moving frame of reference if

1888
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,319
you center it by its frame of reference

1889
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,920
then it can actually look like something

1890
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,160
like a stationary diffusion process and

1891
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,680
you get around that by encoding the

1892
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,520
system rather in terms of absolute

1893
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,760
position something like the velocity or

1894
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,280
the momentum of these higher orders of

1895
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,240
motion

1896
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,839
so yeah i just totally agree with

1897
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,520
everything you said basically and it's

1898
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,760
like the historical um critique or

1899
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,440
comment like well that race car has a

1900
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,160
historiosity it's like it is but its

1901
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,920
position at the next time point is

1902
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,559
determined by its position and

1903
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,599
momentum and etc etc etc now

1904
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,799
and then that is happening through time

1905
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,799
so there is historiosity

1906
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,000
we're not ignoring that but we're

1907
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,079
setting up the problem with this like

1908
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,160
vector of higher derivatives such that

1909
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,280
it actually

1910
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,119
is being only determined by the next

1911
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,799
moment so

1912
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,439
absolutely dean

1913
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,279
well thanks for stealing all my under

1914
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,279
there daniel

1915
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,920
i basically was going to ask so

1916
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,399
just to make this clear in my head the

1917
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,479
metaphor that i drew is you've got

1918
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,719
classical mechanics and quantum

1919
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,238
mechanics in the room and then busy

1920
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:35,679
mechanics is kind of acting like the

1921
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,839
marriage counselor it doesn't really

1922
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,759
actually determine

1923
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,040
what what is

1924
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,399
the you know

1925
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,719
the math can't just be precise it just

1926
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,198
keeps the two other parties in the room

1927
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,759
and has them work out what's

1928
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,920
what's a gist and what's a reflection or

1929
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,880
am i

1930
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,719
am i kind of way

1931
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,520
way off in the in the in the reads here

1932
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
yep so the connection to quantum

1933
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,439
mechanics which was made in this one

1934
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,799
section of the paper this was actually

1935
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,040
something that was suggested by

1936
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,158
um

1937
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,040
by uh greg pavliotis who is uh lance's

1938
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,000
supervisor imperial i'm actually not

1939
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,839
convinced that the connection to quantum

1940
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,120
mechanics

1941
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,520
is as fundamental like so i i basically

1942
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,158
i don't think that uh bayesian mechanics

1943
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,359
is in between classical and

1944
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,719
um

1945
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,880
uh classical and quantum mechanics i see

1946
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,479
bayesian mechanics

1947
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,839
more as

1948
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,520
the mechanics of statistical

1949
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,439
distributions or basically the moments

1950
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,520
of statistical distributions

1951
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,439
so in that way if i was to put it in

1952
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,120
between two branches of physics i would

1953
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,560
probably put it more

1954
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,479
at the

1955
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,560
three-way in between

1956
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,960
classical mechanics

1957
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,560
statistical thermodynamics and

1958
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,799
stochastic thermodynamics because it's

1959
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,400
really uniting

1960
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,760
the um

1961
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,320
the kinds of coarse-grained expect

1962
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,080
expected variables that you deal with

1963
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,280
with something like statistical

1964
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,719
thermodynamics

1965
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,960
with the sorts of motion that you deal

1966
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,320
with in things like stochastic

1967
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,800
thermodynamics or classical mechanics so

1968
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,239
we're talking about the motion of

1969
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,679
beliefs or about probability

1970
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,960
distributions

1971
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,400
and it gets interesting when you have a

1972
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,920
markov blanket because then you can

1973
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,159
start imbuing the system with these like

1974
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,159
quasi-teleological

1975
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,840
interpretations of one thing being a

1976
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,480
belief about another thing

1977
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,920
but the bayesian mechanics per se

1978
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,320
actually i think it even

1979
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,120
i mean it's it's it's controversial

1980
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,239
whether you would call it bayesian

1981
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,679
mechanics but there is definitely this

1982
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,840
kind of statistical or belief-based

1983
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,760
dynamics that you get even in systems

1984
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,679
without a mark-off blanket even a

1985
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,080
one-dimensional diffusion process where

1986
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,159
there's no boundaries or anything you

1987
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,239
can describe that system as optimizing

1988
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,960
model evidence or minimizing free energy

1989
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,000
it's just

1990
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,840
it's it's unclear how where where the

1991
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,679
bayesian this is because

1992
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,280
the bayesian interpretation really comes

1993
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,719
in when you're conditioning something on

1994
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,000
observations and then you have

1995
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,320
uncertainty about another variable that

1996
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,840
you can only perceive via the

1997
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,920
observations so that's why the markov

1998
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,520
blanket i think actually is kind of

1999
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,440
fundamental to the bayesian slant on the

2000
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,560
mechanics

2001
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,239
but even without it you have free energy

2002
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,600
minimization and you have

2003
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
the evolution of beliefs or evolution of

2004
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,199
belief distributions it's just they're

2005
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,760
not they're not as

2006
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,760
they don't have a nice analogy with like

2007
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,360
representational mechanics or the things

2008
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,120
we're interested in in cognitive science

2009
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,880
or biology

2010
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,239
yeah that's the part where lance was

2011
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,920
talking about gist

2012
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,880
and reflection and how a gist

2013
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,600
morphs into a reflection and that's

2014
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,199
i don't even know how you would put the

2015
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,159
math to that but because i don't know i

2016
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,800
wouldn't know where to begin but that's

2017
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,159
that's where i thought you guys were

2018
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,120
headed

2019
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,480
am i

2020
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,719
am i misled no i think that's right

2021
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,480
that's kind of um

2022
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,840
it gets that kind of i think the thing

2023
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,440
that daniel was saying earlier where

2024
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,480
there's

2025
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,280
there's the expected internal state

2026
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,960
given a particular blanket state but

2027
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,239
then there's the idea that any

2028
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,400
instantaneous internal state is actually

2029
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,360
also encoding an expected external state

2030
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,280
whether or not that particular internal

2031
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
state is the most likely one given the

2032
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,120
blanket state so i don't know which of

2033
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,880
those would map to gist versus

2034
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,120
reflection but that's basically the idea

2035
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
is that any given realization of the

2036
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,719
stochastic process

2037
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,280
at any given moment even if it's off is

2038
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,920
kind of always parameterizing some just

2039
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,920
perception about something on the other

2040
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,920
side of the blanket so the markov

2041
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,120
blanket the fact that there's a

2042
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,800
multivariate system with these kinds of

2043
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,239
conditional independencies that really

2044
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,560
is fundamental to the interpretation of

2045
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,560
saying one side is doing some kind of

2046
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,160
just perception of the other side

2047
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,000
[Music]

2048
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,840
you just don't have one side or the

2049
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,920
other without the ability to distinguish

2050
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,520
them which i think is a good example

2051
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,679
about how the intuition that there are

2052
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:49,760
separable systems

2053
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,560
is being built upon in this nexus as you

2054
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,400
described with thermodynamics and

2055
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,000
statistics and statistical mechanics and

2056
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
there's other approaches to delineate

2057
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,159
subsystems like synergetics trying to

2058
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,640
define subsystems geometrically or

2059
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,640
trying to define subsystems through

2060
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,679
various ways and maybe those will become

2061
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,400
integrated as well so steven and then

2062
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,480
anyone can write a question or raise

2063
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,159
their hand

2064
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,400
okay thanks connor for that that

2065
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,199
explanation is quite useful as well that

2066
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,360
you know when you mentioned that there

2067
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,159
can be bayesian inference say on

2068
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,000
information coming in

2069
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,679
but the blanket

2070
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,520
you know gives

2071
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
it gives a way to to hold that

2072
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,159
information i suppose but it i can see

2073
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,800
it giving a much more viable route to

2074
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,000
integrate many sources

2075
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,960
of information which might be also sort

2076
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,320
of staggered over time as they come in

2077
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,960
and they can be integrated i mean you

2078
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,679
can integrate across blankets whereas

2079
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,120
if everything's coming in as one mush of

2080
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,040
you know all data is coming in through

2081
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,719
the same

2082
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,520
or or even if it's not directly data but

2083
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,239
if if you've only got one

2084
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,600
causal

2085
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,040
pathway

2086
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,679
then you can't necessarily

2087
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,760
i can't see a way that you could

2088
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,000
disambiguate

2089
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,080
and do bayesian inference

2090
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,520
between

2091
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,400
what we would use blankets for or you

2092
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,440
could even say multi-sensory integration

2093
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,440
then that becomes a physical channel so

2094
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,000
i suppose one question is how would you

2095
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,920
think about

2096
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,920
different channels of information

2097
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,159
as opposed to

2098
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,040
different blankets in terms of bayesian

2099
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,520
integration

2100
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,199
yeah i think the the actual the

2101
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,880
multi-channel or multi-sensory

2102
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,040
integration story is pretty nicely

2103
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,719
accommodated by this and this kind of

2104
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,400
brings back to an earlier question that

2105
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,440
daniel had about what is the

2106
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,480
interpretation of that pi matrix so when

2107
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,080
you're thinking about the system

2108
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,400
minimizing free energy another way of

2109
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,800
thinking about that is it's minimizing

2110
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,480
prediction errors

2111
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,199
for each of the sensory modalities so if

2112
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,760
our blanket states say we have a

2113
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,760
three-dimensional external state a

2114
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,360
three-dimensional internal state and a

2115
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,440
three-dimensional blanket state because

2116
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,080
this generalizes to infinite i mean not

2117
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,000
infinite but very high integer dimension

2118
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,520
our three-dimensional blanket state you

2119
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,400
could think of as like eyes ears and

2120
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,400
somatosensation or something

2121
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,560
and then the the distinct elements of

2122
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,280
that pi matrix are basically the weights

2123
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,280
that the system that the internal states

2124
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,280
are assigning to each of those sensory

2125
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,600
channels so if you actually rewrite the

2126
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,000
flow of the internal states as a

2127
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,080
function of that pi matrix

2128
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,840
you can basically see that the internal

2129
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
states has differential sensitivity to

2130
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,000
each of the three

2131
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,679
blanket states in fact it's literally

2132
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,080
integrating them and the weights it uses

2133
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,080
to do that that sum or that average are

2134
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,760
provided by the elements of the pi

2135
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,880
matrix

2136
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,360
so i think the multi-sensory integration

2137
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,360
is basically just a higher dimensional

2138
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,040
blanket state

2139
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,040
what it doesn't get at with what i've

2140
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,199
just said is your idea of information

2141
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,960
from different channels coming in at

2142
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,880
different time lags or different

2143
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,040
delays that is what you would have to

2144
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,320
accommodate with something like an

2145
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,080
integrator chain where

2146
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,920
one blanket state is actually a high

2147
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,920
order derivative of some other blanket

2148
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,840
state or something like that or of an

2149
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,679
external state so you can have different

2150
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,600
blanket states that from the perspective

2151
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,920
of internal states are all coming in at

2152
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,920
once but the actual blanket states

2153
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,480
themselves are like

2154
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,800
longer scale temporal summaries of other

2155
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,640
variables one could be the instantaneous

2156
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,159
temperature the other could be the time

2157
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,320
derivative of temperature the other one

2158
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
could be the average temperature over an

2159
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,880
hour or something like that

2160
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,800
also sometimes i think about it like

2161
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,000
from a data science example like imagine

2162
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,600
if we had three variables that are

2163
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,000
getting passed to us like height weight

2164
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,679
and favorite color

2165
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,920
um maybe that reflects this covariance

2166
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,920
matrix like height and weight up there

2167
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,199
on the first two

2168
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,840
have highest correlation with themself

2169
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,920
and then they have less correlation with

2170
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,600
each other and then

2171
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,360
the off diagonal is not having any

2172
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,040
covariance we don't get information

2173
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,040
about the favorite color based upon the

2174
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,760
other variables say so

2175
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,520
multi-sensory

2176
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,760
can just be different state variables

2177
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,360
that are getting passed through that

2178
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,600
vector it doesn't have to be that all

2179
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,920
the blanket states are of the same type

2180
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,760
the blanket states are just the set of

2181
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,679
insulating states

2182
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,760
and they don't all have to be

2183
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,400
retinal cells now if you were making

2184
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,960
this type of a model of the retina it

2185
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
would be that way but then if you wanted

2186
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,840
to make a model of a person who had

2187
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,400
sound input light input

2188
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,920
etc

2189
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,280
you could have the blanket states

2190
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,920
reflecting multiple different types then

2191
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,520
you get this challenge of

2192
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,440
how is the brain integrating different

2193
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,840
lags and different precisions etc across

2194
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,520
different modalities so that's not the

2195
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,960
end of the story but

2196
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,320
it it um

2197
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,800
is phrased generally enough in the state

2198
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,560
space representation

2199
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,560
such that we can be discussing in the

2200
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,640
same matrix multiple kinds of inputs

2201
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,080
yeah exactly

2202
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,760
yeah actually conor if you had any

2203
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,560
thoughts on this example like how should

2204
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,080
we read the you know pi equals what and

2205
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,480
then q equals what

2206
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,880
right yeah so this is a point where i i

2207
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,400
kind of wanted to bring this up earlier

2208
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,280
because

2209
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,880
i think i i don't know

2210
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,960
it would be good i good to talk to lance

2211
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,960
about this um i think he's coming to the

2212
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,960
next one so maybe he can follow up

2213
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,840
but

2214
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,760
basically this is actually an example of

2215
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,040
a system where

2216
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,000
causality does not imply

2217
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,760
does basically not exactly correlate

2218
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,000
with the markov blanket so in that pi

2219
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,760
matrix that's not actually the

2220
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
covariance right that's the inverse of

2221
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,800
the covariance

2222
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,199
so that's a really important point

2223
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,840
the inverse of the stationary covariance

2224
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,000
is not going to have necessarily zeros

2225
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,440
in all the same places that the

2226
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,880
covariance does

2227
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,719
so you could have two variables that

2228
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,159
actually have positive or negative

2229
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,840
correlation with each other as measured

2230
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,960
by the square root of the covariance

2231
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,239
that are actually conditionally

2232
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,440
independent

2233
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,400
so for instance in this example um the

2234
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,280
internal which is the first row or the

2235
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,640
first column

2236
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,400
and the external which is the third row

2237
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,360
or the third column they're

2238
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,520
conditionally independent of each other

2239
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,199
which means there's a zero in the

2240
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,440
corresponding entry one three or three

2241
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,400
one

2242
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,080
so that doesn't mean that the variables

2243
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,560
are uncorrelated it means that if i

2244
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,040
condition on blanket states the middle

2245
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,360
row slash middle column

2246
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,520
then there's no more information i can

2247
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,960
get

2248
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,960
from external states about internal

2249
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,800
states or from internal states about

2250
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,400
external states it's basically saying

2251
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,400
that the internal states get all the

2252
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,159
information they possibly can from the

2253
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,560
blanket states and the external states

2254
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,800
don't add anything else that's actually

2255
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,239
a different statement than saying that

2256
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,480
there's no stationary

2257
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,400
steady-state correlation between

2258
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,239
internal and external

2259
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,760
and it goes further than that then if

2260
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,600
you actually looked at the drift matrix

2261
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,679
which is the second equation here

2262
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,040
you can see

2263
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,920
from the presence of uh elements in the

2264
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,239
1 3 and three one elements of that

2265
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,000
second equation that big thing that's

2266
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,159
like one one point five two

2267
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,560
there's actually a direct influence of

2268
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,719
internal states on external states in

2269
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,880
the sense that the motion

2270
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,520
of external states is directly

2271
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,159
influenced by internal states so if you

2272
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,760
were to integrate that stochastic

2273
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,280
differential equation there would be a

2274
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,400
causal

2275
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,920
if you want to call it that a causal

2276
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,440
connection going from internal to

2277
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,719
external

2278
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,719
but nevertheless because of the way that

2279
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,639
the stationary covariance is designed

2280
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,400
when you take its inverse

2281
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,400
internal is still conditionally

2282
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,360
independent of external

2283
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,120
so this is a really interesting and kind

2284
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,440
of counter-intuitive result that is

2285
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,800
talked about a little bit in miguel's

2286
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
paper it's also talked about a little

2287
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
bit in an upcoming paper

2288
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,679
that is um in review right now

2289
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,280
uh that that basically rigorously

2290
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,280
defines the conditions under which a

2291
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,120
causal connection actually results in

2292
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,719
conditional independence between two

2293
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,239
variables

2294
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,920
so that's basically what the example

2295
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,199
here is showing is that you could have

2296
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:19,360
internal directly influence the motion

2297
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,679
of external or vice versa but in the

2298
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:23,040
stationary sense they're still

2299
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,280
conditionally independent and therefore

2300
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,960
the markov blanket is still needed to

2301
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,840
mediate information between them

2302
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,400
awesome and it was

2303
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,520
we'll look forward to these papers um

2304
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,600
but that's a really great way of laying

2305
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,639
out how we build upon this idea of just

2306
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,960
bayesian variables and the graph that

2307
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,320
describes them

2308
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,120
to dynamical systems and their

2309
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
covariances through time

2310
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,159
and then frame that in terms of flow

2311
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,239
which can then be decomposed into this

2312
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,560
time reversible and a time irreversible

2313
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,159
component ties us into this entire flow

2314
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,040
uh

2315
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,480
areas of

2316
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,040
thermal flow but also information flow

2317
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,520
and so also just conor while we have you

2318
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,880
let's take this next step which is

2319
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,480
let's partition

2320
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,080
the blanket states into two kinds of

2321
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,040
states

2322
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,679
sensory on the incoming and action or

2323
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,840
active states on the outgoing so what is

2324
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,239
going on with this blanket partitioning

2325
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,120
and

2326
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,719
how does it relate to active inference

2327
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,320
how does active inference relate to this

2328
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,920
bayesian graphical approach more

2329
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,239
generally

2330
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,239
yeah so um here we're basically making

2331
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,639
the move of taking the blanket states

2332
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,600
and they could be again

2333
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,360
of general dimension and then

2334
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,199
partitioning them themselves into two

2335
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,880
subsets of states

2336
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,520
uh active states and sensory states

2337
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,719
so if we

2338
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,639
if if you basically look at the dynamics

2339
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,159
of the system

2340
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,239
and you look at the expected variables

2341
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,040
you can say that you know the expected

2342
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,120
internal state given blanket states is

2343
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,920
doing inference about

2344
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,159
external states at the same time you can

2345
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,120
say that the expected active state

2346
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,000
given sensory states is in some sense

2347
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,199
minimizing prediction error

2348
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,280
so basically minimizing the the

2349
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,440
deviation between the expected internal

2350
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,760
and the expected external state so

2351
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,920
that's where you get along the lines of

2352
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,840
uh of basically an active inference

2353
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,320
interpretation and i think it's

2354
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,560
figure six if i'm not mistaken where

2355
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,400
that

2356
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,360
yeah or no that's predictive processing

2357
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,760
figure eight is where you can basically

2358
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,719
show that the active the uh most likely

2359
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,159
active state so again this is an

2360
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,800
expected active state is minimizing the

2361
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,639
sum of precision weighted prediction

2362
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,280
errors so the the move here is then you

2363
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,840
relate minimizing when you're minimizing

2364
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,760
um prediction errors in the context of

2365
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,280
inference it's like i'm doing optimal

2366
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,760
bayesian inference when i'm minimizing

2367
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,360
precision weighted prediction errors in

2368
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,440
the context of control it's like i'm

2369
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,400
doing pid control which basically

2370
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,719
manuel baltierra has shown this in a

2371
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,280
paper from a few years ago that is the

2372
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,000
sort of prediction error minimization so

2373
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,280
now the

2374
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,440
elements of that pi matrix become the

2375
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,639
weights that you

2376
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,199
that you associate to each variable that

2377
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,199
you're trying to control in like a pid

2378
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,960
system so pid is this kind of

2379
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,360
proportional integral derivative control

2380
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,880
mechanism

2381
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,560
so we don't do this in the paper but if

2382
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,560
you were to associate different blanket

2383
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,639
states with different like derivatives

2384
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,800
along an integrator chain like

2385
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,199
the the um integral the derivative and

2386
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,800
then the second derivative of some

2387
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,840
process

2388
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,760
and then those were your blanket states

2389
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,440
then you could say that the active the

2390
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,600
most likely active state was basically

2391
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,320
trying to control the integral

2392
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,199
the

2393
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,199
first order and then the derivative of a

2394
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,280
given system

2395
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,040
trying to control them using a pid

2396
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,960
control scheme

2397
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,719
and where the weights that the pid

2398
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,520
controller is assigned to the integral

2399
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,760
the first order value and the derivative

2400
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,679
those weights would be exactly given by

2401
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,440
the entries of the pi matrix that

2402
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,800
correspond to the blanket variables

2403
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,280
awesome and actually the integrator

2404
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,960
chain idea

2405
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,840
really connects some dots between this

2406
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,520
variational

2407
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,600
higher and higher derivatives of

2408
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,679
challenging functions variational

2409
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,400
inference on nonlinear functions with

2410
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,639
planning as inference

2411
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,320
so again it's like going back to that

2412
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,239
car with the position and the momentum

2413
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,440
etc

2414
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,400
um

2415
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,239
there's one way of working where you

2416
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:35,360
just want to

2417
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,440
fit the function of the car

2418
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,600
using its again position and higher

2419
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,600
derivatives but then what does it look

2420
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,679
like when you need to predict the

2421
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,760
position of the car so that you can act

2422
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,120
and intervene

2423
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,400
and so this just connects between this

2424
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,920
uh

2425
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,320
graphical structure where you can have

2426
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,800
arbitrary number of layers of nodes so

2427
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,520
from left to right is going through time

2428
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,800
but then

2429
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,880
vertically within a column

2430
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,239
is in a differentiation an integration

2431
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,440
relationship so we connect from looking

2432
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,199
at a vector

2433
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,080
of

2434
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,480
position and higher derivatives

2435
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,639
connect that to

2436
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,719
the kinds of systems that

2437
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,880
have uh blanket states

2438
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,840
that's just really cool to see

2439
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,440
um

2440
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,639
yeah

2441
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,000
so with yeah go ahead

2442
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,760
yeah sorry was there someone else had a

2443
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,600
question or go for it connor but anyone

2444
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,360
can raise their hand or any questions in

2445
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,800
the chat is awesome

2446
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,480
i was just going to say

2447
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,679
like it's essentially that it's that um

2448
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,159
this so if if we were to cast the

2449
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,000
blanket variables as these different

2450
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,600
higher this vector of higher order

2451
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,679
derivatives of a system

2452
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,600
just by that system conversion to its

2453
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,159
stationary state it would be implicitly

2454
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,920
if we started far away from the steady

2455
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,560
state it would be implicitly essentially

2456
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,400
controlling each of those variables to

2457
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,239
some desired set point so that's often

2458
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,920
the terminology using control theory is

2459
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,880
that i'm trying to keep the velocity

2460
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,400
within some range keep the position

2461
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,000
within some range keep the acceleration

2462
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
within some range so if you interpret

2463
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,840
the dynamics of the most likely active

2464
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,320
state as doing pid control basically

2465
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,239
what it's doing is it's punishing

2466
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,719
deviations around those desired set

2467
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,960
points with some control cost where the

2468
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,159
control cost exactly is given by the pid

2469
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,239
weight assigned to the acceleration

2470
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,320
velocity position which is you can read

2471
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,480
off from the inverse of the stationary

2472
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,920
covariance i.e the the pi matrix

2473
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,120
to kind of give a fun example of that um

2474
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,360
one way of looking at this figure 10 in

2475
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,280
the helmholtz supplement

2476
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,360
is kind of like there's an ink blot and

2477
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,040
so there's some forces that have it

2478
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,120
dispersing and some that have it staying

2479
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,960
together and then when you look down

2480
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,120
from the top that's like the steady

2481
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,199
state distribution of the ink plot and

2482
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:56,960
so that's sort of a diffusiony way to

2483
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,199
look at it but let's look at this as

2484
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:02,400
like a physical hill so the z-score the

2485
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,080
the height is they're not not the

2486
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,080
statistical z-scores the height is like

2487
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,880
um the concentration at steady state of

2488
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,960
ink so whatever the diffusion processes

2489
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,880
are it's densest right in the middle and

2490
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,639
then it gets less so we can think about

2491
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,400
that as being like the bottom of the

2492
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,199
bowl

2493
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,440
and then it gets higher up so when you

2494
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,840
drop the marble in the bowl

2495
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,440
it's going to on average go to the

2496
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,880
bottom of the bowl

2497
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,480
and then if you were to think about that

2498
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,360
marble as like a control theoretic agent

2499
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,080
with its position which is initially not

2500
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,600
at the bottom of the bowl and then all

2501
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,280
of the higher order derivatives so

2502
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,719
initially if it's stopped on the side of

2503
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,400
the bowl it's like you're holding the

2504
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,800
higher derivatives to be zero then you

2505
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,000
release it and gravity takes effect etc

2506
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,960
it would almost look like it was like a

2507
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,760
plane landing on the bottom of the bull

2508
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,199
because it would like accelerate and

2509
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,120
then it would slow down its acceleration

2510
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,199
and the higher order derivative it would

2511
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,320
act

2512
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,520
as if it were doing pid control

2513
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,560
to converge all of its and then diminish

2514
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,400
all the derivatives so that it would end

2515
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,120
up

2516
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,800
with zero

2517
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,719
velocity and the differential from the

2518
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,280
mean of the expectation of zero so

2519
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,760
that's like kind of an inanimate system

2520
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,080
but that shows how this diffusion

2521
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,040
flow

2522
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,000
field

2523
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,719
and then the free energy interpretation

2524
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,480
of kind of like the gibbs free energy

2525
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,000
dropping into the bowl finding yourself

2526
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,920
on the bottom of a physical bowl

2527
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,239
is also related to control theory so

2528
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,199
there's like

2529
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,639
so many of these

2530
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,639
important threads to connect together

2531
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:39,920
any other

2532
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,440
uh

2533
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,440
general comments otherwise i think just

2534
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,400
because

2535
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,560
we love active inference

2536
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,360
what is happening in figure eight like

2537
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,239
what is happening on the right side and

2538
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,800
maybe why is it not a monotonic uh

2539
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,960
drop in free energy which is what we saw

2540
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,440
in the other figures

2541
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,800
yes so this is um this is basically the

2542
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,000
demonstration of what you just said that

2543
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,639
on average the system um and that's a

2544
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,199
very key point of what of uh just to add

2545
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,880
that on to what you said on average the

2546
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,199
marble will look like it's trying to get

2547
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:18,960
to the bottom of the bowl

2548
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,120
and minimize those deviations from the

2549
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,639
different set points for position

2550
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,639
acceleration velocity what have you so

2551
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,120
this is basically showing that

2552
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,800
so i'll just explain the figure on the

2553
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,400
left that the white line is basically

2554
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,719
the most ac the most likely active state

2555
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,040
which is one of the two blanket states

2556
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,159
given

2557
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,560
various settings of the sensory state so

2558
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,400
the white line is saying for any given

2559
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,320
setting of the x-axis what is the most

2560
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,280
likely setting of the y-axis

2561
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,199
but then we also show overlaid on that

2562
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,760
expectation which is just a linear line

2563
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,520
a linear function of the sensory state

2564
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,840
we also show an actual realization of

2565
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,920
the process and that's really the the

2566
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,280
key thing to note here there's a

2567
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,400
difference between expectations

2568
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,400
and which are derived from the steady

2569
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,360
state to statistics versus realizations

2570
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,120
of the process which are contaminated

2571
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,880
with all the

2572
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,639
nitty-gritty messy things of the real

2573
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,639
world like noise and solenoidal flow and

2574
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,719
stuff like that so this also goes to

2575
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,320
answer your second question about the

2576
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,159
plot on the right is why is the system

2577
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,560
not doing monotonic decrease on

2578
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,320
uh free energy

2579
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,600
and the reason is because there's

2580
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,440
solenoidal flow

2581
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,920
so if there is no solenoidal flow and

2582
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,760
you average this descent across

2583
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,520
trajectories

2584
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,520
an individual trajectory even without

2585
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,600
solenoidal flow might still not do

2586
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,920
monotonic free energy descent because of

2587
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,320
noise so the stack stochastic noise

2588
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,520
you're adding to these diffusion

2589
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,679
processes can temporarily drive it up

2590
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,000
the gradients of the free energy

2591
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,159
but if i average across like a thousand

2592
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,239
trajectories it would look like a smooth

2593
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,840
descent on free energy because all the

2594
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,159
noise realizations would be averaged out

2595
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,760
and then there would basically just be a

2596
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,360
straight line going from wherever you

2597
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,120
started this

2598
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,520
ensemble of parallel simulations to the

2599
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,000
to the bowl the minimum free energy but

2600
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,880
because of solenoidal flow which is this

2601
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,639
component of the drift that drives the

2602
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,560
system along the iso contours of the

2603
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,120
probability density which is not

2604
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,800
pointing in the direction of the free

2605
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,159
energy minimum

2606
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,000
because of that even after you average

2607
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,080
across trajectories the free energy will

2608
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,000
not monotonically go down but it'll

2609
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
actually follow some average trajectory

2610
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,400
that has some curvature to it

2611
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,320
um so that's an actually interesting

2612
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,000
interpretation in the active inference

2613
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,600
sense because it's so showing that on

2614
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,840
the way to the free energy minimum it's

2615
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,520
not necessarily going to take

2616
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,920
the the path laid out by the most likely

2617
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,080
active state given sensory states it

2618
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,920
might actually take a more circuitous

2619
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,840
route and it will end up on the white

2620
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,159
line by the time it's at the minimum but

2621
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,000
its journey to that white line on

2622
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,040
average and in individual realizations

2623
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,639
will not actually be along the white

2624
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,520
line um and that's a really interesting

2625
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,960
there's a connection there to be drawn

2626
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,639
to the study of

2627
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,880
basically efficient um

2628
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,719
diffusion processes that are used in

2629
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:03,679
things like

2630
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,360
markov chain monte carlo so people

2631
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,080
basically define design diffusions in

2632
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,400
order to accelerate convergence to

2633
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,400
a stationary target distribution this is

2634
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,760
used a lot in like

2635
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,040
stochastic

2636
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,040
sampling based approximate bayesian

2637
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,880
inference and there's actually a lot of

2638
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,560
evidence and there's mathematical proof

2639
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,120
behind this too that diffusion processes

2640
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,199
with this kind of curvature solenoidal

2641
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,199
flow are actually better at reaching the

2642
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,520
minimum and they do so faster rather

2643
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,120
than one that's just doing a direct

2644
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,239
descent

2645
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:35,199
on the log probability

2646
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,080
which is equivalent to the free energy

2647
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,159
nice thank you one one thing i'll point

2648
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,560
out about this figure on the left is

2649
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,880
that the x-axis has twice the uh

2650
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,199
scale as the y-axis

2651
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,679
so you can also this white line is like

2652
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,080
the y equals x line like it's right at 0

2653
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:54,960
0

2654
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,880
is that that's the bottom of the bowl

2655
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,840
and then

2656
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,040
it's it's

2657
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,800
it's just stretched out a little bit in

2658
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,719
one way but it's kind of like that's

2659
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,560
just the y equals x line that would be

2660
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,159
if the um

2661
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,239
that's just the one to one and then it

2662
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:11,360
starts up here with the s of t a of t

2663
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,360
and then it kind of finds its way to the

2664
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,159
bottom and that connects to figure 10

2665
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,800
with the helmholtz decomposition where

2666
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,320
just like conor was saying we can

2667
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,960
separate out into this solenoidal which

2668
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,600
is going like around the isocontour

2669
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,880
and then this

2670
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,440
um straight-line component and so the

2671
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,159
extreme of one case um assuming that

2672
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,320
such a line of sight exists is like

2673
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,520
you're at the bottom of the mountain and

2674
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,280
then you just like straight line up to

2675
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,239
the top

2676
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,639
but then the kinds of systems that we're

2677
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,639
looking at here

2678
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,199
are where we can decompose their actions

2679
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,320
into an as if straight line that's

2680
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,320
always going up the maximum possible

2681
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,080
elevation gain to the mountain top or

2682
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,840
the maximum possible descent to the

2683
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,199
bottom of the bowl

2684
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,280
but also there's this wiggle with a

2685
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,679
solenoidal coupling that's guaranteed to

2686
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,719
be orthogonal to that first component

2687
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,880
and that was an interesting point about

2688
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,400
designing the kinds of diffusion

2689
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,880
processes that do help us

2690
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,080
find

2691
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,600
whether you phrase it as the top or the

2692
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,719
bottom but find the free energy optimal

2693
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:17,119
place on a landscape that might be very

2694
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,520
rugged so a lot of misleading

2695
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,719
elevation changes

2696
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,040
hey daniel

2697
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,639
doesn't that just give another feather

2698
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,000
in the cap for

2699
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
interactionism over instructionalism

2700
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,159
can you maybe explain that a little more

2701
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,719
and then we'll see congress

2702
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,159
yeah i think what conor just pointed out

2703
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:41,199
was really

2704
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,119
critical if you're if we're optimizing

2705
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,400
we have to be

2706
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,639
willing to set up condition where

2707
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,800
we're not enforcing

2708
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,239
a linear

2709
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,119
path

2710
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:55,199
that we're actually allowing for the um

2711
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,920
what do you want to call it the

2712
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,000
degree of variability and that's what

2713
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,119
interactionism supports so

2714
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,560
i just i was just listening to that

2715
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,960
going yeah there's another

2716
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,960
there's another proof now we've got the

2717
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,000
mathematical evidence

2718
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,400
cool it's like work and play a little

2719
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,480
bit with um

2720
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,400
the most direct way

2721
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,159
to get those instructions might be with

2722
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,560
a little bit of interaction along the

2723
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,520
way they're just they're um

2724
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,600
inseparable in the actual realization of

2725
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,520
the process

2726
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,239
any thoughts on that connor

2727
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,159
yeah i think i think that's i mean i'm

2728
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,760
always excited when people kind of can

2729
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,400
connect solenoidal flow to specific

2730
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,880
domains i'm not sure what instructionism

2731
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,199
or or interactionism are but i'm

2732
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,760
assuming that it's basically saying that

2733
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,320
just a linear classic optimization

2734
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,719
taking the path of steepest descent is

2735
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:51,840
actually kind of maybe

2736
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,760
counterintuitively not always the best

2737
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,520
option i think that's just what

2738
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,360
solenoidal flow captures in any

2739
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,360
stochastic dynamical system is the fact

2740
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,280
that there's some curvature

2741
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,760
uh to the actual dynamics of systems

2742
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,360
where they're not always trying to go to

2743
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,360
the mode of the density but they might

2744
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,119
actually get where you're trying to go

2745
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,960
by kind of taking an alternative route

2746
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,560
on the way there and it's just really

2747
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,000
cool that mathematically you can show

2748
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,239
that that's actually better than taking

2749
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,960
the path of steepest descent

2750
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,800
it's like the ball can't just go down to

2751
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,159
the bottom in a straight line then put

2752
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,800
on the brakes the real path takes a

2753
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,280
little bit of a different route so

2754
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,800
oh yeah oh i want to slip one more thing

2755
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,800
in because i i want to give steven a

2756
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,639
boost before he speaks

2757
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,239
and that is that i've heard steven a

2758
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,520
number of times

2759
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,600
mention the word trust

2760
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,679
and trust takes time

2761
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,600
and i think again that interaction and

2762
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,040
that that trust piece this this math

2763
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,960
confirms that we don't just have to

2764
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,000
intuit that there's actually now some

2765
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,040
some support for what takes time and

2766
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,119
what will actually optimize

2767
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,960
maybe the most

2768
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,800
sought after outcome

2769
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,119
not always necessarily the best but at

2770
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,119
least it gives you a

2771
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,199
higher likelihood of achieving an

2772
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:06,400
outcome

2773
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,320
because you can you can you can now say

2774
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,280
trust

2775
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,360
takes time but there's there's a sort of

2776
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,480
a almost a mathematical imperative to

2777
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,040
give more time over to something to

2778
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,440
arrive at the best answer

2779
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,760
sorry stephen but i just wanted to

2780
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,679
you know sort of boost what you've been

2781
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,000
saying a lot and i because i i agree

2782
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,960
with it

2783
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,840
thanks dean

2784
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,639
stephen

2785
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,560
yeah it's an interesting yeah i think

2786
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,040
the trust piece and what you could call

2787
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,719
real life i don't know if we would talk

2788
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,560
about real life but

2789
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,840
a couple of questions that sort of come

2790
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,199
from that is saying is like you know if

2791
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:42,560
you're talking about

2792
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,719
um this this solenoidal flow is is that

2793
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,320
property or that

2794
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,159
um does that become

2795
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,679
a more

2796
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,679
optimal

2797
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:54,960
um

2798
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,360
way of achieving

2799
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,360
radiant descent when there's more noise

2800
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,719
or the more

2801
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,800
rugged the landscape i suppose that's my

2802
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,520
first question and the other question is

2803
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,639
i just wanted your thoughts you

2804
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,360
mentioned here like active states so

2805
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,119
this idea of like

2806
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,199
it's almost like sensory data coming in

2807
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,480
on active

2808
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,880
states and we often talk about active

2809
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,440
states and action states i

2810
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,360
what's the states of action

2811
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,199
that starts the organism does but i

2812
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,159
suppose

2813
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:25,520
internally

2814
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,000
you've just got the active states which

2815
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,760
are kind of like almost mathematical

2816
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,520
codependencies so i'd be interested in

2817
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,600
like i say the amount of noise or

2818
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,760
ruggedness or approximation that has to

2819
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,400
happen and how much the solenoidal if it

2820
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,600
if it really makes a difference or

2821
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,520
whether the math just is the same if

2822
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,520
it's smooth and and and

2823
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,520
just your thoughts on how states are

2824
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,360
talked about in terms of active or

2825
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,960
action

2826
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,320
oh if that's something you think about

2827
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,119
yeah

2828
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,119
um yeah so for your first point so when

2829
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:56,560
you say the ruggedness of the landscape

2830
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,880
you mean like it's not just a quadratic

2831
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,040
single bump but there might be multiple

2832
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,000
bumps

2833
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,400
yeah i'm actually not sure i i don't i

2834
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,880
don't have any intuitions about why what

2835
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,960
solenoidal flow would do in that case i

2836
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,480
think like daniel was kind of saying it

2837
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,920
might actually be better at finding the

2838
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,440
global optimum

2839
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,159
the research i'm aware of is just saying

2840
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,520
that for even

2841
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,080
unimodal distributions like this

2842
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,679
sometimes the solenoid flow actually

2843
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,440
gets you to

2844
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,239
the

2845
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,560
unique optimum faster

2846
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,000
even though you would think that direct

2847
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,280
descent should be fastest in the

2848
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,440
presence of noise in the dynamics so not

2849
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,119
a rugged landscape but just the dynamics

2850
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,119
are perturbed by noise the solar nodal

2851
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,320
flow will actually get you to the

2852
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,880
optimum faster but in the case of the

2853
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,800
actual probability distribution of the

2854
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,880
steady state is multimodal and rugged

2855
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,639
itself that's a very interesting

2856
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,320
question i don't know

2857
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,920
i just don't know the research what it

2858
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,600
says and i personally don't have any

2859
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,600
intuition about whether solano flow

2860
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,760
would accelerate convergence to the

2861
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,440
global optimum

2862
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,159
um or not but i i i would be surprised

2863
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,360
if no one's researched that because it's

2864
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,040
a very interesting question

2865
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,800
and then regarding the active states

2866
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,480
versus action

2867
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,320
yeah i mean

2868
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,080
i guess that i haven't thought that much

2869
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,920
about what like what

2870
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,239
semantically jumps out to me or what i

2871
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,000
associate when i hear active state

2872
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
versus action but i guess i think of

2873
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,639
fluctuations in the active states as

2874
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,960
actions so as the active state evolves

2875
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,040
that's what i would call an action or an

2876
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,119
or a particular realization of an active

2877
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,119
state as an action and then the active

2878
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:30,159
state itself we just refer to as the

2879
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,560
random variable that's a stochastic

2880
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,159
process that evolves over time and we

2881
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,239
refer to that as the active state

2882
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,600
um so we have the both the

2883
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,800
two-dimensional in this case

2884
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,719
two-dimensional blanket states one is a

2885
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,320
random variable that we call the sensory

2886
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,239
state another one is a random variable

2887
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:45,679
we call an active state so that whole

2888
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,360
stochastic process

2889
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
is the active state and maybe individual

2890
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,719
realizations of it would be an action

2891
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:53,920
thanks connor

2892
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,920
stephen and then anyone else and then

2893
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,080
also in this last few minutes if anyone

2894
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,920
in the live chat has a question they can

2895
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,920
write it so stephen

2896
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,679
thanks that that's helpful i think like

2897
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,239
you mentioned that i was thinking maybe

2898
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,840
particularly about noise so yeah that

2899
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,440
makes sense if there's more noise when

2900
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,480
there's more

2901
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,920
rugged landscape yeah that's an

2902
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,840
interesting question

2903
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,760
that maybe someone's worked on i was

2904
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,679
wondering what you're basically saying

2905
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,760
with active states is

2906
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,840
there are more flux there's a there's a

2907
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,400
greater flux a bit like sensory state

2908
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,880
like the information coming in as is

2909
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,159
more fluctuating and i.e like well you

2910
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,320
could say lights going at billions of

2911
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,119
hertz you know or whatever

2912
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:39,119
and then it's the the regularities are

2913
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,920
slowing down as it comes in the active

2914
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,040
states would be a greater flux

2915
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,560
compared to going through the blanket

2916
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,000
and the transferring it

2917
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,520
to whatever

2918
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,520
the perturbations

2919
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,920
that are relevant to our model are on

2920
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,639
the outside so that's kind of

2921
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:57,840
interesting

2922
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,560
one comment on that is um

2923
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,960
the actual error dynamics or just

2924
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,280
baseline dynamics of each of these kinds

2925
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,719
of states it's going to depend on the

2926
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,560
system but when we're thinking about

2927
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,320
biological systems yes the action states

2928
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,679
can be conditioned on what the system is

2929
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,239
like if there's one degree of freedom on

2930
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,159
the elbow joint then it's a

2931
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,560
dimensionally reduced

2932
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,280
in comparison to the incoming

2933
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,320
sensory data for example so

2934
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,480
active states end up kind of saving the

2935
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,480
day in a lot of ways which is why it is

2936
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,440
such a clutch advance in the field to

2937
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,280
partition the otherwise just co-mingling

2938
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,960
blanket states into this kind of

2939
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,840
incoming and outgoing because then we

2940
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,040
can assign those incoming states and the

2941
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,880
statistically causal chains coming

2942
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,199
inbound we can associate that with

2943
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,520
inference and with

2944
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,040
everything related to predictive

2945
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,840
processing and then on the outbound from

2946
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,679
the internal states going back out to

2947
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,840
the active states we can associate that

2948
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,639
with cybernetics control theory and also

2949
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,800
planning as inference so the

2950
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,199
partitioning is is a is an immensely

2951
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,440
important maneuver steven and then

2952
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,119
anyone else

2953
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:16,639
yeah and also the active states become a

2954
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,800
proprioceptive

2955
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,040
form of i mean really appropriate

2956
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,600
perceptive form of sensory input in a

2957
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,119
funny sort of way like

2958
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:29,520
in the sense that how much they change

2959
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,520
so for instance you push your i'm kind

2960
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,880
of curious where there's this blending

2961
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,440
you know you put your hand on a on a hot

2962
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,440
on a wall and you push you're sensing

2963
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,480
the wall

2964
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,480
but you're also sensing your active

2965
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,719
states aren't changing as much

2966
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,159
that makes sense because the wall is

2967
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,280
stopping them

2968
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,440
there's an interest in

2969
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,280
but that that all could be happening at

2970
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,800
this kind of

2971
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,360
fluctuating speed

2972
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,600
however like you just mentioned

2973
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,679
the system structure will

2974
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,280
the fact that you've got an elbow and

2975
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,800
the fact that it allows certain things

2976
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,280
to happen is going to make all that come

2977
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,159
into

2978
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,239
context of the system you know so that's

2979
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,159
quite cool

2980
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:11,119
yep um sorry if there's any noise there

2981
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:13,520
but yes when the um person is pushing on

2982
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,840
the wall they might be getting a

2983
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,760
different than expected or less than

2984
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,880
expected

2985
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,639
amount of change in their sensory input

2986
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,080
wow it's really loud i'm just going to

2987
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,719
view it for a second

2988
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,000
incredible times so

2989
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,520
um both conor and lance have uh departed

2990
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,080
for today and i believe that we'll be

2991
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,960
talking with at least lance next week in

2992
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,040
the 26.2

2993
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,920
so in this last 10 minutes or so

2994
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,360
let's look back over the paper and any

2995
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,199
of the other figures and let's think

2996
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,520
about what we want to ask or what we'd

2997
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,880
like to explore

2998
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,800
in that dot too

2999
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,600
so

3000
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,960
who has any thoughts of this

3001
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,600
i got i have a thought

3002
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,600
i didn't raise my hand sorry um

3003
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,520
at some point the the 60 year old me

3004
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,600
would like

3005
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,600
some of this be to be brought down to

3006
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,199
six-year-old me in terms of the

3007
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,920
sophistication of the math and sort of

3008
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,199
maybe

3009
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:23,119
maybe walk through some more of those um

3010
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,119
the ability to be able to explain to

3011
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,119
somebody that there isn't that there is

3012
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,960
a an underpinning of math that explains

3013
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,920
what this medium is about and why

3014
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,199
things pass through it and and

3015
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,679
and necessarily allow these two

3016
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:44,639
differentiated states to work

3017
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,639
i know that i know that they have to be

3018
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,719
able to explain it in

3019
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,480
in on the level because it's it's

3020
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,000
complexity so they have to be able to

3021
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,320
use a certain sophistication of math but

3022
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,239
if there's some way for them

3023
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,159
to be able to bring that down to the my

3024
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:01,040
pedestrian level my six-year-old level

3025
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,840
that would be fantastic because then

3026
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,520
i think it would be a lot easier for

3027
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,600
people to climb on board with the idea

3028
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,800
that

3029
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,040
some of this some of this

3030
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,360
bayesian mechanics stuff

3031
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,080
um doesn't have to remain remain elusive

3032
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,159
or out there but it's actually

3033
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:20,159
something useful that we can incorporate

3034
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,800
into a lot of the practices that we

3035
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,080
would like people to adopt

3036
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,960
thanks

3037
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,199
dean agreed good thing to think about

3038
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,520
and also dave wrote in the chat we seem

3039
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,960
to be convinced that some kinds of

3040
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,360
partitioning simplify analysis great

3041
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,719
point so

3042
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,280
um internal external blanket is not the

3043
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,440
only partitioning of how you can

3044
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,239
partition nodes in a bayesian network

3045
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:46,320
and sense an action isn't the only

3046
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,159
partitioning that is possible for

3047
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,199
blanket states so different ways of

3048
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:52,960
partitioning the problem

3049
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,239
are going to

3050
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,000
variously set it up in a way that's

3051
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,600
going to be confusing

3052
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,080
or impossible to solve or

3053
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,239
challenging to solve or potentially easy

3054
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,880
to solve and sort of the exemplar of the

3055
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,719
easy problem to solve

3056
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,480
computationally not the only example but

3057
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,639
just one example is like again the ball

3058
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,960
rolling to the bottom of a hill smooth

3059
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,080
ball

3060
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,600
perfect gravity

3061
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,560
convex optimization it's very easy if

3062
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,400
you know that the shape of the bowl is a

3063
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,719
quadratic function then all you have to

3064
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:25,199
do is just yep go downhill wherever you

3065
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:28,480
are really simple heuristic algorithm

3066
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,760
for getting to the bottom of that

3067
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,280
quadratic bowl

3068
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,440
and then we look out on the ruggedness

3069
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,679
and on the changingness of the fitness

3070
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,199
landscapes or of the free energy

3071
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,360
landscapes for real systems

3072
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,440
and the entire question is again how can

3073
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,080
we partition nodes or take the

3074
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,000
derivative of sets of nodes or of

3075
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,920
different random variables so that we

3076
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,760
can make that rugged landscape and

3077
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:53,199
transform it or at least act on a smooth

3078
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,320
landscape

3079
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,679
so that's sort of the broad theme is can

3080
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,199
we just

3081
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,560
cut things up

3082
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,159
and reframe them

3083
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,880
so that our challenge is more like the

3084
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,800
marble going down the bowl

3085
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,679
rather than bushwhacking you know and

3086
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:10,880
we're just totally lost and we don't

3087
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,639
even have a sense of whether we're going

3088
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,480
up or down and all of our motion is for

3089
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,718
naught so stephen and then anyone else

3090
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,159
yeah i suppose in a way our cognition is

3091
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,000
trying to help us make things look more

3092
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,920
and more like things are rolling down a

3093
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,119
bowl

3094
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,800
and it's a smoother more

3095
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,480
clear picture of the world you know as

3096
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,599
we get older so it'd be interesting

3097
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,360
maybe to ask a couple more questions

3098
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,159
about how noise um

3099
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,360
i know

3100
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,199
how noise i mean often they use the

3101
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,560
infomax

3102
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,040
or softmax the infomax function i think

3103
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,800
in a lot of active inference modeling

3104
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,239
you know to add

3105
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,520
some noise

3106
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,679
or to add some distributions so i'd be

3107
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,040
interested in how

3108
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,280
where does the covariance

3109
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,360
break down where does it

3110
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,560
start to become more coherent smoother

3111
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,560
and just their thoughts on that seems to

3112
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,920
be quite

3113
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,920
that seems to be relevant

3114
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,440
beyond

3115
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:12,000
this particular paper thanks dean

3116
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,239
yeah one last thing

3117
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,040
so

3118
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,000
to me

3119
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,320
what i see is is

3120
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,000
the math now

3121
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,520
on paper talking about possibility not

3122
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,080
talking about

3123
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,000
certainty i still think that what this

3124
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,239
does is it opens up

3125
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,719
the possibility this this map opens up

3126
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:36,000
the possibility as opposed to arriving

3127
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,159
at a certain outcome i think all it does

3128
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:40,159
is open up that space that's what that

3129
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,800
markov blanket to me essentially does is

3130
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,639
it keeps the door open

3131
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,159
i know it's described as a as a blanket

3132
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:50,080
but i honestly think it what it does is

3133
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,280
it it creates an openness for more math

3134
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:56,000
to be able to flow in and so

3135
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,400
just i know they're not philosophers but

3136
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,159
i'd like to hear some of their

3137
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:01,920
philosophy around

3138
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,480
what that what that does because i think

3139
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:08,000
if people want to say oh well your math

3140
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,239
doesn't answer all the all the all the

3141
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:11,599
questions

3142
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:15,199
fine but it does open up a lot of things

3143
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,119
that previously we couldn't even say

3144
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,280
we're open to your point

3145
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,719
so i'd like to find out what their

3146
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,800
philosophical

3147
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,480
positions are now that they've been able

3148
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,520
to

3149
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,719
sort of bring this math to a place where

3150
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:29,760
it does

3151
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,320
prove out

3152
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,639
cool dean thank you and yes what you

3153
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,320
said there about like

3154
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,199
uh from certainty into uncertainty and

3155
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,360
of course always leaving that room for

3156
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,880
the interaction

3157
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,800
it puts everything

3158
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,280
on the the uncertainty

3159
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,960
and the precision are there two sides of

3160
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,040
the same coin the precision is the

3161
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,840
inverse covariance so if two things are

3162
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,320
perfectly covariate there's like a one

3163
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,040
or a high number in that matrix

3164
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,119
then your precision is high

3165
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,119
um uh so

3166
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:03,920
or

3167
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:04,960
just

3168
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,639
it's in the math but yes if they're

3169
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:09,199
variable with respect to each other then

3170
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,639
knowing one doesn't tell you about the

3171
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,159
other if they're not variable with

3172
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,599
respect to each other then knowing one

3173
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:15,280
gives you high precision on the other

3174
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,679
and it puts all kinds of state

3175
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:18,960
inferences

3176
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:23,360
on this continuum of precision so

3177
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,719

3178
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:28,719
helpful that we were able to speak with

3179
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:32,880
the authors and yeah next week in 26.2

3180

3181
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,800
more of you on the stream

3182
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,800

3183
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,119
they want to ask something or

3184
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:42,880
just have us

3185
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,400
digest it or

3186
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,400
modify a question at all

3187
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,880
but as you said very

3188
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,040
important contributions and scales

3189
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,800
