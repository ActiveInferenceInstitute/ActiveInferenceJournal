00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,120
hello everyone

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,280
welcome to acton flab live stream number

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,759
25.1

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
today is july 6th 2021 and we're going

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
to be talking about the paper

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
the computational boundary of a self

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,279
developmental bioelectricity

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
drives multicellularity and scale-free

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
cognition

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
we are a participatory and online lab

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,320
that is communicating

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,399
learning and practicing applied active

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,480
inference you can find us at the links

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,760
here on this page

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
this is a recorded and archived live

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,680
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,480
feedback

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
so that we can improve our work all

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,239
backgrounds and perspectives

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,800
are welcome here we will be following

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
good video etiquette for

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
live streams here at the short link you

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
will see all of the live streams and

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,960
different series that we've done leading

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
up to this in the communications unit of

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,559
the active inference lab

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,559
and today we're going to be jumping into

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,920
the first half of

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
a discussion of the paper uh in july and

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
on the 13th

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
we will have 25.2 which is also on this

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,040
paper and hopefully with

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
the author joining today

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,759
in act in flab live stream number 25.1

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
we're going to be learning and

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
discussing this paper

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
uh so i will um pass it off i'm blue and

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
i am an independent research consultant

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,159
based out of new mexico and

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
i will pass it to steven for a quick

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
round of introductions

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,799
thanks blue hi so this is stephen here

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,640
i'm based in toronto

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
um i'm doing a practice-based phd and uh

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,520
i'm interested in how active inference

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
can help unify

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
lots of threads that have been very

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
confusing to me over the last few years

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
and if it's okay i'm gonna throw this

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,119
over to dave

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
douglas yes hi i'm in the philippines up

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
in the mountains uh the rainy season has

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
begun

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
and we just survived the fourth of july

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,119
so all is good

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
thanks back to dan i guess thanks uh i'm

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,040
daniel

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
i'm in davis and yep looking forward to

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,879
this

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
point one discussion and also nice job

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
with the broadcasting and facilitating

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
blue

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
thanks so we can just start off with

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
just some questions about

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
what you liked about the paper or what

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
was something you remembered or

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
something that you're curious about

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
well i am embarrassed to say i didn't

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
read it at

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
all and i was you know i i started

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
looking over it as oh my goodness

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
we're going to talk about wilhelm reich

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,640
we're going to talk about orgones and

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
orgasms and cloud busters and

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,280
and living flying saucers and i guess

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
we're not going to get any of that so

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
i don't know

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
cool well the aims and claims of the

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
paper um

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
so here the paper the author says the

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
aims were to define

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
individuals themselves in a way that

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
facilitates taxonomy comparison and

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,599
communication

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
with evolved created biological

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,159
artificial and

87
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,720
exobiological agents and he proposes a

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
fundamental definition of an individual

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
based on the ability to pursue

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,720
goals at an appropriate level of scale

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
and organization

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
and suggests a formalism for defining

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
and comparing the cognitive capacities

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,560
of highly diverse types of agents

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,400
what does anybody think about that

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
yeah i i think that the multi-scale

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
part of this is very very interesting

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
very exciting because

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
this is one of the big offerings that

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
active influence has

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
and it's been offered in a a lot of

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,560
simulations in silico context but

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
to have it actually described from a

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
real biological

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,238
kind of cellular perspective

106
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,079
and is for me really really useful

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
because i'm kind of looking partly at

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
how the heuristics of all this are as

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,639
much as the

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
you know the mathematics of it so yeah i

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
think that's really really interesting

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,080
cool daniel i liked the part about

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
taxonomy because that kind of speaks to

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
this evolutionary

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
worldview and it always seemed

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
interesting to me

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
studying collective behavior like in the

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
ants that there were really precise ways

119
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
of talking about comparing

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,479
some physical properties in biosystems

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:52,880
like

122
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
how hard is the material or its density

123
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
and then there was

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,880
less of a way to talk about similarities

125
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,360
in

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,880
cognitive processes whether on an

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,759
organism or

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
how they interacted with their niche

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,039
especially so

130
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
just the idea that there could be a new

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
sort of tool

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,720
in the toolbox to help us compare

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
different cognitive systems

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
that might have hybrid aspects like

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
computer and human or

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
agent and niche those are kind of cool

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
areas to explore so i think that's a

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
big topic

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,280
definitely like the other maybe um

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
like comparison of like cognitive

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
capacities

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
isn't really related to cognition but

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,199
it's integrated information theory right

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,919
so

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
you know when you can compare like the

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,199
consciousness of

147
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
a slime mold versus the consciousness of

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
a human

149
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,199
this kind of stands uh alongside of that

150
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
in in terms of

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
you know being able to to maybe not

152
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
quantitatively yet but

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
hopefully um you know people will

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
run with this and be able to apply some

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,080
quantitative methods to that

156
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
uh cool so he the author

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
also proposes a plausible naturalistic

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
framework for the evolutionary

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,720
scale-up of cognition from the earliest

160
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
origins of life

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
and hypothesizes about the forces that

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
drove it and the major transitions along

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
the continuum and the goal is to show

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
how complex agency and goal directedness

165
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,800
evolves naturally

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,479
from ancient mechanisms

167
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,160
uh so some questions how do multiple

168
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
nested scales of individuality work

169
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
uh that's super interesting to me let's

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
see

171
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
um daniel yeah

172
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
well i wrote the question so maybe i'll

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
ask or bring up why i thought it was

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
interesting

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
uh is there like a total value

176
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
of cognition in the full full stack here

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
the full cone

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,639
and then there's going to be certain

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
levels that are more relevant than

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,520
others

181
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
because they're a total amount of

182
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
individuality

183
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,120
or are there just certain ways

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
that like the the cones for example

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,199
don't overlap

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,960
like there's certain spaces almost that

187
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
are implied that are

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
more than the sum of the parts and so

189
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
how's

190
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
how are we gonna even just first draw it

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,960
out

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
think about it

193
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
actually one thing that comes to mind

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
when you talk about the sum of the parts

195
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
i think

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,240
what i i'm interested by when he talks

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
about a cell

198
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
and then he talks about these groups of

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
cells and how they are sort of joined

200
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
and there's this kind of bioelectric

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
dynamic that sort of helps them

202
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
communicate i think that's a really

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
um making a bit of a jump here but i

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
think it's interesting

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,800
to the difference between people

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
communicating in a community

207
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
context where there's this kind of

208
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
resonance going on between people

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
and what it's like when there's just

210
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
separate entities

211
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
sending messages to each other so to

212
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
speak um

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
there's something about this um ability

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,440
to

215
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,080
form some sort of bioelectric

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,759
um dynamic which i think is

217
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,479
in itself quite interesting as a

218
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
heuristic

219
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah for sure daniel agreed we're gonna

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
bring it go to bioelectricity soon

221
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
because i think

222
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
with um the author visiting next week

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,600
it'll be good to

224
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
get some of these notions that we're

225
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
having about where

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
bioelectricity plays a role like those

227
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
are some of the

228
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
big theoretical questions like what is

229
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
individuality across

230
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,160
levels is it informational is it

231
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
evolutionary

232
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
is it functional all these questions

233
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
about like holism and reductionism more

234
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
than the sum of the parts

235
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
what is collective behavior what is

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
emergence there's that whole

237
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
body of thinking and then

238
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
the piece that's tying it all together

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120
is the bioelectric

240
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
and there's a few reasons why in the

241
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
paper that

242
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
is being proposed as important like the

243
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
primacy or the primitiveness

244
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
um and also just the um signaling

245
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,279
dynamics and the

246
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
what it appears to allow cells to be

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,519
able to do we can explore that later

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
so agree like how is bioelectricity

249
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
supporting this broader story about

250
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,640
multi-scale systems

251
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
which doesn't just just by drawing it

252
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
out this way doesn't imply

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
bioelectricity

254
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
so where is bioelectricity coming into

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
the picture

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
we'll keep thinking about that

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,240
yeah absolutely i'll be we'll talk about

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,839
that later i think and it's it's

259
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
something that i don't think

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,079
and correct me if i'm wrong other papers

261
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,000
on active inference

262
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
they have not tended to come at that

263
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
aspect it's it's they've tended to come

264
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
at it from a

265
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
in silico kind of statistical

266
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,720
state-based

267
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
process so this this does give something

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
that's a bit more um

269
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
organic i suppose potentially so i think

270
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,240
that

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
there's maybe there's much more that can

272
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,880
be drawn from that going forward so

273
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
thanks

274
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
yeah i think the um you know people have

275
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,079
done

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
more organic uh stuff but it's always

277
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,920
like even related to bioelectricity but

278
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,480
i think

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
it's always related to neural

280
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,440
bioelectricity as opposed to non-neural

281
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
bioelectricity which is what kind of

282
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
drives this paper forward and the you

283
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
know of course there's a relationship

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
between bioelectricity and the

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,279
homeostatic drive

286
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
which the author talks about as driving

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
the major evolutionary transitions

288
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,360
and you know probably much of what we do

289
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
much of how organisms think and behave

290
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
is driven by you know that that drive

291
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,839
for uh homeostasis

292
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
so uh more questions what do we

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
learn or enable when we understand

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,360
multi-scale individuality

295
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
daniel maybe one way to

296
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
frame what we could learn or enable here

297
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,399
would be like in a read

298
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
and write with respect to

299
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,560
designing new kinds of multi-skill

300
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
systems that's like the right

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
and then to look around and discover the

302
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
kinds of multi-scale systems that we're

303
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
already interested in with like reading

304
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
so it's kind of there's an interpretive

305
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
ability when we can look across

306
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
multi-skill systems but then also

307
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
within a virtual machine or within some

308
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
sort of

309
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,519
physical system there's ways to just

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,200
design systems that have certain kinds

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
of relationships between the parts and

312
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
the holes like

313
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
a governance system where such and such

314
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,079
a distribution

315
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,600
of of uh influence exists or something

316
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
like that

317
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,839
stephen stephen

318
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
one area that's been of interest and i

319
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
think this can relate to

320
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
is in an area called mental space

321
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
psychology they've been looking at

322
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,079
peripersonal

323
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
neurons the mirror neurons as people

324
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
talk about them as well

325
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
and how they resonate and i think that

326
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
um

327
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,519
this that ability to get that dynamic

328
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,079
relationship between people or with

329
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,959
objects

330
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,120
in our shared model and the ability for

331
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
these

332
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,519
to see that there's some sort of

333
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
resonance in terms of how things relate

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,200
to others in space

335
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
that that seems to tie into what you

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
were saying about the bioelectrics

337
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,120
of um neurons tightenings

338
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,920
have been sort of related to this and

339
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
ties into that ability

340
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
for maybe us to re or reconnect some of

341
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,560
these

342
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,320
um inference processes

343
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
across distance you know because

344
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
obviously the cells they're touching

345
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,920
each other

346
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
there's a plausible root but how do we

347
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
maybe get some of these

348
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
resonances between cells which are not

349
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,160
touching each other

350
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,720
or even organisms which are not touching

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
each other or maybe they need to touch

352
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
and that gets us into intimacy and stuff

353
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,199
but

354
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
yeah good point that like brings us so i

355
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,399
just pulled up the slide

356
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
um talking about gap junctions which

357
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,000
these are like

358
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
you know it's their little holes that

359
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,279
enable

360
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,480
you know those proximal cells to

361
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,120
share information essentially um about

362
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
their environment or

363
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
their intracellular um

364
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,480
like state of existence and that's a

365
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,959
cool

366
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,120
um way for you know that it facilitates

367
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,440
the

368
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
the informational spread um and

369
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
we see that in the figure also let's see

370
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
let's come to that figure

371
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,040
um so this one yeah

372
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
so that gives you like you know if if

373
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,360
there was a boundary like a solid

374
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,920
boundary

375
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
or maybe even a lipid bilayer that

376
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
wasn't didn't have a little hole in it

377
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
connecting cells then there would just

378
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,000
be the individual spatial

379
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
perception that's shown here in figure

380
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
three but

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
because of the gap junctions um you know

382
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,199
a cell

383
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,760
communicates to all the proximal cells

384
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,399
and

385
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,040
this expands the spatial perception and

386
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,240
the memory and the

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
anticipation and so it's like this group

388
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
integration here

389
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
uh dave

390
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
yeah going even farther into field

391
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
effects

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
um i heard a presentation by some

393
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
students in china

394
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,920
recently who were tracking down

395
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,440
non-uh

396
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
tracking down electrical effects in

397
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,079
mammalian nervous systems that

398
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
didn't that were not confined to

399
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,800
local chemical and electrical effects so

400
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
they didn't even need to use the pores

401
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,800
they said this is not dominant

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,639
but it's there and under certain

403
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
circumstance it does become pretty

404
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
important like in um

405
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
long-term potentiation they're saying

406
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
that's part of what's going on that you

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
get these standing waves

408
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,759
and they're then they're uh conjecturing

409
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,160
that

410
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,880
that part of the classic brain waves are

411
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,320
literally are waves in the brain

412
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,440
rather than a summation of these

413
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
local uh synaptic jumps

414
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
don't know daniel oh

415
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
daniel yeah just one comment on

416
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
what dave just said there about these

417
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,079
kind of traveling

418
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,600
fields that is really related to

419
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
kristin and collaborators work with spm

420
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
which was basically a toolkit for

421
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
looking at dynamical systems

422
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
and then integrating imaging based

423
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
modalities for like neuroimaging and

424
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
with the field-based measurements like

425
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,040
eeg

426
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,560
so kind of taking a certain anatomical

427
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
shape into account

428
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,720
when you are integrating these different

429
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,839
projections or different

430
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
modeling ways of kind of

431
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
two different uh perspectives on the

432
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
same underlying system so that's kind of

433
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,279
an interesting

434
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
link that you just

435
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
made there yeah it's hard to under it

436
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
it's hard to overestimate the importance

437
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,360
of

438
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,759
professor fristen's enormous amount of

439
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,559
hands-on

440
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,799
work with interpreting brain

441
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,839
direct physical brain data and how

442
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,959
important that is in just implicitly

443
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
shaping how he

444
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,160
uh approaches uh these system

445
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
activities and system effects yeah i

446
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,520
keep

447
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,880
yeah i keep slapping myself wait a

448
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,240
minute what does this guy spend the last

449
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,959
40 years

450
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,720
doing you know don't get stuck in the

451
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,600
peculiarities of the

452
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
mathematical descriptions he has a real

453
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
reason for doing this stuff

454
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,160
that way dania

455
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,799
you go first stephen oh okay yeah sure

456
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
well i suppose

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
being a bit speculative here but with

458
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
the brain waves in the way that we've

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
got this bioelectrics on the cell

460
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
i mean different scales of i think this

461
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
is an open question but it certainly

462
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,640
seems to have plausible

463
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
roots to being thought about is how much

464
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
of these

465
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
brain waves or this electrical activity

466
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,080
across

467
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
regions of the brain analogous or in

468
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,200
some way

469
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
similar to the the descriptions at the

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,640
cellular

471
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
and multi-cellular level so i think

472
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
that's a good point that

473
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,679
dave brings up there

474
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,840
thanks daniel yep great point

475
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
stephen and that's one of the main

476
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
i think arguments or the ways that the

477
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
field or understanding of

478
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
biology would sort of shift if

479
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,320
bioelectric were given a

480
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
larger role there'd be more of a

481
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
continuum of

482
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,919
chemical and electrical function between

483
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,760
internal nervous systems and

484
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
the epithelial cells which like we

485
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
talked about in the dot zero

486
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,559
are closely related through development

487
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
and other cell types and seeing that as

488
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
more of a unifying framework within an

489
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,480
organism's

490
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,080
cognition as well as in an evolutionary

491
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
sense like all these

492
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
different affordances that the

493
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
bioelectric reconfiguration

494
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
allows for which is some of the work

495
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,039
that's cited in the paper and

496
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
has continued since then is just

497
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
empirical demonstrations that the

498
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
bioelectric field can like lead to

499
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
different morphologies

500
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,600
and so then there's kind of a way to

501
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
move on that phenotype landscape that

502
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,799
doesn't

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,400
involve like only the um sequence based

504
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
remodeling of gene regulatory networks

505
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
like transcription factor binding site

506
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,440
evolution could still be important

507
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
and also there could be certain points

508
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
where the bioelectricity

509
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,679
enables new uh things to new phenotypes

510
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
to change as well

511
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
yeah definitely and um maybe a little

512
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
bit in this paper but

513
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
a lot of mike's work is really great uh

514
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,720
talking about

515
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
um or or demonstrating you know the the

516
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,000
role of

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
bioelectricity in shape and you know

518
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
when you think about like

519
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,520
you there the form and the function are

520
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
just coupled together

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,000
so like the function of

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
a cell and the shape of a cell and all

523
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
that is is really

524
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,039
um interesting and how bioelectricity

525
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,159
is connected to the form and the

526
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
um function uh stephen

527
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,159
yeah and i think this also ties or

528
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
certain gives reason to look at some

529
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,120
other

530
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
people who presented such as the work on

531
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,720
um

532
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
quantum contextuality that we had and

533
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
that some of the information geometry

534
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,159
work and there's the new paper on um

535
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
bayesian mechanics and active inference

536
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,679
this whole idea of

537
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
the shape of information which

538
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
i mean that is very cutting edge but i

539
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,159
think they

540
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,960
they don't seem incompatible let's put

541
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,679
it like that

542
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
i don't want to put my name to how

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
they're compatible exactly but this

544
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,799
certainly seems to be an awful lot of

545
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,559
things here that would

546
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,480
suggest their plausible connection

547
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,760
definitely uh daniel oh

548
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,000
daniel so one other aspect there's the

549
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
extended spatial that's this horizontal

550
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,520
representation where whether it's the

551
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
bacteria that are aggregating in the

552
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,400
biofilm

553
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,600
or the development of the embryo

554
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
or whatever extended spatial system

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,679
maybe even like networks of computers or

556
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,000
something

557
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,360
like that that's extended spatial extent

558
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,919
in the snapshot and then there's also

559
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,400
this

560
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
blue going down visualization here like

561
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
with memory

562
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
fading off into the past and then also

563
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,000
the green

564
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
like the anticipation so that's the

565
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,200
current state

566
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
anticipating out forward so just kind of

567
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,760
using a uh visualization of kind of

568
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
space going out and time as this

569
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
axis that goes through the current

570
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
moment that

571
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
turns out to be something that

572
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
visualizes the past present and future

573
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,159
really nicely but then also like we saw

574
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,280
with the light cones

575
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
and probably other approaches it kind of

576
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
sets up the

577
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
integration of memory action in the

578
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
moment and

579
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
anticipation in a way that's almost like

580
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,640
set up to be addressed

581
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
with a commonality rather than a future

582
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,960
oriented framework

583
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
that has to bolt on this like memory

584
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,000
module it doesn't really make sense

585
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
but this is a more integrated way to

586
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,600
think about the past present and future

587
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,200
nice uh stephen yeah i like thanks

588
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
daniel for bringing that up actually

589
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,240
that's really helpful and and i one

590
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
thing that i find curious as well is

591
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
even though we're talking about cells

592
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,039
we think about how that diagram puts the

593
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,159
future up

594
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,720
and the past down right as we think

595
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,799
about could have done it the other way

596
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,240
but that's naturally how we look up

597
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
and the air you know to see things and

598
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,559
things go down

599
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,360
and a bit more in the earths and that's

600
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
where our history is so

601
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,159
even though it probably was not

602
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,080
conscious that would have just felt like

603
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
the right way to design the diagram you

604
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,120
see how

605
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,919
um you know the way we make our meaning

606
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,159
is

607
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
is embodied as well the way we make our

608
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
diagrams is

609
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,639
in ways embodied

610
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
yeah nice definitely daniel so that

611
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
steven that kind of uh whether

612
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
something's pointing up or down

613
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
it reminds me of in evolutionary biology

614
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
where some subfields

615
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,919
would have a tree that branched up so it

616
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,200
looked like a tree

617
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
other fields would show it branching

618
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
down and then there was like apparently

619
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,960
disciplinary

620
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
like debates over which which rotation

621
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,880
of the same information it quote really

622
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
was is it a tree or is it you know

623
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
something else but then that was related

624
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
to a question that

625
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
i just had about the visualization

626
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
so it's cool that these panels were kind

627
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
of

628
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
maybe something we can ask about next

629
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
week they seem to be made like in

630
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,400
collaboration

631
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
with an artist so that sounded like

632
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,159
something kind of interesting

633
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
to have in a scientific paper it helps

634
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
it be more discussable

635
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
sometimes but maybe there's a learning

636
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
experience for

637
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,480
the people involved and then also just

638
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
like it's

639
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
pretty easy to visualize the chemical

640
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
part like we have these beautiful you

641
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
know walking protein visualizations

642
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
kind of like okay proteins kind of look

643
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
like that and they bump into each other

644
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,159
but then how will we visualize the role

645
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,600
of the

646
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,880
bioelectric greeting scott nice to have

647
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,440
you

648
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
how will we visualize that um

649
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,559
in new ways maybe by integrating the

650
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,400
future and the past into it or i don't

651
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,679
know maybe there's some other way like

652
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,120
the diamonds that we saw

653
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
so yeah yeah i think that's that's to be

654
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,799
a really good question to ask actually

655
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,240
because um

656
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
yeah i work quite a lot with in graphics

657
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,600
studios where they do

658
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,120
different types of diagrams for

659
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
different things and i think

660
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
there's a lot of stuff that conventions

661
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
that are out there so they must have had

662
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,799
to

663
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
also bring in and sort of make it make

664
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
sense in the scientific paradigm but i

665
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,159
do like the way that

666
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,000
they've they've used the term perception

667
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
there and brought that in for a cell

668
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
i think that's um again unusual but

669
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,520
makes sense if we think of perception in

670
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,960
a much more deflationary sense than how

671
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
people traditionally think about

672
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
perception and active inference as well

673
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,200
as

674
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,240
just some sort of way of knowing um so i

675
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
really and again that also starts to

676
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
bring in

677
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,400
like cells when we think about

678
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
what is the meaning that's not how a

679
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,840
cell is

680
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,080
cells could have a sense of knowing and

681
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,919
there could be a hundred billion cells

682
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
knowing which is pretty much what

683
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,600
indigenous knowledge says

684
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400
about knowing so it's another it ties in

685
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,240
with that regime of knowing which

686
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
is often minimalized and excluded so i

687
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,679
think this is quite

688
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,120
quite useful nice and just kind of to

689
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
talk about like different

690
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,120
renditions of like the light cone i mean

691
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,559
this is a question that i

692
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,080
definitely have for the author uh here

693
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,679
this is like not the traditional way

694
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,919
that i'm used to seeing a light cone so

695
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
this in this slide you can kind of see

696
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
how it's more of like a conical shape

697
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,520
as opposed to like a diamond um and like

698
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,799
in space and time um and even like so

699
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,400
this is up and down

700
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,720
um but you know there's also this

701
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
rendition that i've seen as well that's

702
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
left and right

703
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
so like from the from the state of right

704
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
now to the

705
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,600
future and so it's interesting to think

706
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
about

707
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,400
why is the space and time bigger

708
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
in the present and going to a more

709
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,919
narrow

710
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
point in the future like for me that's

711
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,120
kind of not

712
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,159
how i'm used to conceptualizing um these

713
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,080
diagrams so i think about the space

714
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
of right now like i can't do anything

715
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,520
other than what i'm doing right at this

716
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,240
moment

717
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,360
but you know potentially the the as time

718
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
goes on my

719
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
my state space gets bigger if that makes

720
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,600
sense

721
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
potential state space i i really like

722
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
that as well because

723
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
the thing is it's interesting that cone

724
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
is a bit it's very popular in this

725
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,159
strategic foresight field of looking at

726
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,799
futures

727
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,600
and strategic futures work but there is

728
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
a slight

729
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
like when it's done as a cone going into

730
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,760
the future it's very

731
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
visual it's like it's like using the

732
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
analogy of a beam of light

733
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,640
effectively again using one modality and

734
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
it assumes it's kind of

735
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
travels in a straight line and it

736
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,679
projects and it's

737
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,760
whereas when you start to get into this

738
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,600
non-linear swarming

739
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,320
type thing i mean in some ways it's you

740
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,559
just see what rises up in the future you

741
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,440
know i mean it's like

742
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
what what structures emerge into the

743
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
future um

744
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,960
they don't project into the future in

745
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
the way that a lot of strategic

746
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,880
foresight so i think this does

747
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,200
that question about how those two

748
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
different models

749
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,000
manifest and get used and how this other

750
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
type of model actually while it's not as

751
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
easy to intuit

752
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
may actually be more more i don't know

753
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
if we say accurate but

754
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
yeah maybe more accurate is better way

755
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,840
of saying it yeah i

756
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
i actually um definitely agree because

757
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
you know not to be morbid but we all are

758
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,880
progressing

759
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
to the same end right so

760
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
and as we age our affordances are less

761
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,679
and less like you know we may we might

762
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,880
not be able to

763
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
you know cognate as well or or we might

764
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,480
be less mobile as we as we get older

765
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,159
uh daniel sorry did i take the words out

766
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,320
of your mouth

767
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
um how about dave first and then i'll go

768
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
okay dave

769
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
yeah so is that becoming more focused

770
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
into the future does that have anything

771
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:44,720
to do

772
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
with most of us becoming more and more

773
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,279
subject matter experts rather than the

774
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,480
other kind of

775
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,960
expert

776
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
daniel nice

777
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
question dave so um the the sort of

778
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,559
duality of the time cone and the time

779
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,120
diamond

780
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,039
it just it just suggests that there's

781
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,320
certain things that we want to think

782
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
about as being maximized in the present

783
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,080
maybe and certain things that are being

784
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,399
as if they're minimized in the presence

785
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,039
so it's just two different and we'll

786
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,919
figure out maybe

787
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,600
in some ways there's some things that we

788
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,960
know off into the future

789
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
and there's other things that are

790
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,080
maximally constrained in the present

791
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
but then to connect that to the

792
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
stephen's question about um

793
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
strategy and um you know ask scott what

794
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
he was

795
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,159
uh interested in with uh you know

796
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,240
joining us it made me think about the

797
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,520
width of this cone

798
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
going out into the future or the the

799
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,799
length of the one that's more like a

800
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,600
diamond

801
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,840
it's kind of like the horizon which you

802
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
need to consider

803
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
for de-risking or for strategy and so

804
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,159
that space

805
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
just like the butterflies wings that

806
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,600
space expands

807
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,240
super rapidly now you might have a

808
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
hypothesis about the space that only one

809
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,760
region is likely to be

810
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,799
um explored or that all of your strategy

811
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,200
would

812
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
would you know work across this whole

813
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,880
space but it just sets up

814
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,279
the discussion instead of like time

815
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,159
points and

816
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,559
bifurcating points it's like actually

817
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
it's going out really vastly

818
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
so there has to be some more adaptive

819
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
way of realigning because

820
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,240
the time cone is going to be too large

821
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,559
to search through in the future

822
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,640
even on a short time step so how could

823
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,159
we enact a strategy in the current

824
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,200
moment

825
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,480
given what something what we are

826
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
maximizing so that

827
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,159
we could actually have an adaptive

828
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,279
strategy moving forward

829
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,600
nice dave and then stephen

830
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,880
no i just hit the button wrong got it

831
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,200
stephen

832
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,279
yeah i saw scott's got his ice cream

833
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,640
cones there so i'm gonna be curious to

834
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,080
hear his his point but

835
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,440
um tying with what we're saying is also

836
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,559
we have this because swarming dynamics

837
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,240
and non-linear dynamics basically

838
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
aren't part of the most systems

839
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,840
approaches

840
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
really there's an assumption that it's a

841
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
volume of information problem

842
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
going from the present to the future and

843
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,080
it's just finding ourselves in all of

844
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,720
that

845
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
but um and at times when we've got the

846
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
like in modern world we've kind of

847
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,159
thought the world is much more

848
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,080
predictable than it is and maybe it was

849
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,240
when it was in a very constrained

850
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,279
system but now you know we can see that

851
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,080
even in

852
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,039
our own social systems the things can

853
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,679
once they bifurcate that whole

854
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,640
cone thing breaks down because it

855
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
suddenly it's

856
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
it just um so i think that there's

857
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,559
there's

858
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,840
there's something quite um useful here

859
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
actually in rethinking and

860
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
using this alternative or maybe

861
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
something which is a

862
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
other version of this um this this this

863
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
version of this cone

864
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,039
um which doesn't rely on ocular

865
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,519
light visual because there's no eyes in

866
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,080
a cell

867
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,679
for instance they're not seen into the

868
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,360
future right there

869
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,120
that's only something that happens at a

870
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
quite a aggregated organism

871
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,919
so um this is this is actually probably

872
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,519
has some other spin-offs that's quite

873
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,360
useful

874
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,279
scott this is a

875
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,960
fascinating conversation so by the way

876
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
this is a cone that i saw in new york

877
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,279
that it was an ice cream cone it was

878
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,000
very impressive it had nine scoops on it

879
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,720
so that was that's the kind of light

880
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,760
cone i like

881
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,080
the um you know i was thinking back of

882
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
that now the knowing

883
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
that you were saying before blue and

884
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
it's so interesting

885
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,039
so what if we perceived a group as a

886
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,360
bunch of cones

887
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,399
a bunch of simultaneous cones and

888
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,799
because if they have embodiments or

889
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,000
shared meaning

890
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,200
physically or mentally then their cones

891
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,799
have a overlap or a similarity or

892
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,799
shared space and but you can't really

893
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,320
experience another

894
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,399
party's cones or or can you indirectly

895
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,679
um so that notion of knowing that really

896
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,440
hooked me when i just

897
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,000
came into the call that you have these

898
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,679
cones going on at the same time these

899
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,559
experiences

900
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,679
that are through time and maybe

901
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
when we read literature what we're doing

902
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
is we're experiencing someone else's

903
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
cone in the past

904
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,559
in order to try to project it onto

905
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,600
our experience in the future and then

906
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
maybe you live by that rhetoric maybe

907
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,440
the rhetoric actually becomes your

908
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,399
future

909
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,399
right so if your mind can have a certain

910
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,640
state that gets acquired by contact with

911
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,159
other states

912
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,240
it makes a conformational change kind of

913
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
like prionic

914
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,559
governance we have a conformational

915
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,440
change in a protein when it misfolds

916
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,600
maybe have a conformational change in

917
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,559
your cone

918
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,039
state when it comes in contact with

919
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,640
another cone that has a different

920
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
folding

921
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
so that the narrative maybe there's a

922
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
narrative

923
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,720
element to the contiguousness of the

924
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,559
cones and because they have a temporal

925
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
and a physical element to them but you

926
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,560
can only experience them in the present

927
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
then the rest of it is just projection

928
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,119
either in the past or the future

929
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,280
and so maybe that's maybe the cone is

930
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,399
entirely rhetorical

931
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,800
and maybe it's convincing yourself and

932
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,760
others

933
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
of the state that you have for

934
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,560
existential continuity

935
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,399
and the ways of knowing maybe goes to

936
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,320
that in terms of multiple

937
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
cone generators trying to get together

938
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,918
and figure out if their little cones

939
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,760
equal a big cone

940
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,560
it's really just a fascinating way to

941
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
visualize the space

942
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
there's one other reference i want to

943
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
make which is from the museum of

944
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
jurassic technology

945
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,480
in california culver city they have been

946
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
displayed by a guy named uh theory by

947
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,599
sono bend

948
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,280
s-o-n-n-a-b-e-n-d and it's called

949
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,079
theories uh theories of memory or

950
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,520
theories of forgetting something like

951
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,079
that

952
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,839
and his whole thing was cones

953
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,760
reseeding and approaching light cones

954
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,079
and the way he divides up space and

955
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,440
knowledge

956
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,560
is by taking different arcs and sections

957
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,920
of these cones is really kind of

958
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,200
fascinating stuff

959
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,800
so really nice scott i'm reminded a lot

960
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,280
of

961
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,960
um shanna dobson and like the way that

962
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,359
she

963
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,640
perceives time and like also

964
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
in microscopy like you can take a

965
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,000
projection of an image

966
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,079
which is where like all of the stacks

967
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,839
from the angles that you're using in the

968
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,359
light cone come together

969
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,920
and you can see it all at the same like

970
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,079
point or it's like flattened out

971
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,079
and it makes me think about visualizing

972
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,280
time like that um

973
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
daniel and then stephen so

974
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,520
thanks scott i totally agree one of the

975
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
big questions is about

976
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,359
the intersections of time cones what

977
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,119
kind of happens at that intersection do

978
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,000
we think about them getting

979
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
like folded up or having some new shape

980
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
that arises

981
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
and i think a way that we could have a

982
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,119
simple

983
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,359
hands-on intuition there is like with

984
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,599
the two-dimensional game of life

985
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,680
where there are certain shapes like

986
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,280
gliders that kind of propagate on the

987
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,240
landscape

988
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
and then there's certain moving shapes

989
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,599
that

990
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,040
perfectly annihilate each other there's

991
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
certain ones that leave only rubble

992
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
there are certain ones that replicate

993
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,720
but then there's other ones that you

994
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
know pass through each other

995
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,599
depending on some feature interaction of

996
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,480
the shape in the

997
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,520
game and then there's ones that uh

998
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,000
do computation like there's of course

999
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
great videos of the game of life being

1000
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,280
set up to do

1001
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,680
an emulation of a of a computer like the

1002
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,640
ones that we're on

1003
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
but slower um so

1004
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,040
that really maybe connects a few pieces

1005
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,839
this sort of

1006
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,119
um agent-based interaction through time

1007
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,520
we get our intuition in this grid zone

1008
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,960
like the game of life

1009
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,160
and then maybe some of those

1010
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,480
interactions are happening in

1011
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,960
the natural systems just like some game

1012
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,480
theory mechanisms that were in the

1013
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
matrix

1014
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,960
of mathematics sort of also play out in

1015
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,720
biological systems really nice daniel

1016
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,960
uh stephen yeah this this question of

1017
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,440
time

1018
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,079
also relates to when we say the now

1019
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,960
you know we know from even to say the

1020
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,839
participatory sense making that

1021
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,760
we're anticipating when something's

1022
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,599
going to happen often

1023
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,160
what we sense is is that there's a lag

1024
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,960
so in a way we're always

1025
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,480
a little bit behind what's just happened

1026
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,640
yet at the same time at certain times

1027
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,480
we're anticipating things

1028
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,760
before they happen and maybe before we

1029
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
realize we're doing the anticipating

1030
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,079
and then we've made the decision before

1031
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,680
we knew we made the decision and then

1032
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,480
we've done it so

1033
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,720
and which is where maybe reason partly

1034
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
why sports is so satisfying because

1035
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,440
we're

1036
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
we're making it have to be the baseball

1037
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
bat has to hit the ball

1038
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
and you're somehow bringing in that you

1039
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,320
know there's no you either hit it and it

1040
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,119
goes out there

1041
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,520
the baseball diamond or it doesn't but

1042
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,640
the same time

1043
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,200
when you made the the the cognitive

1044
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,760
process

1045
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
happened earlier the realization of what

1046
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
you actually hit it

1047
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
might be later than the now that you

1048
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,599
think you're in

1049
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
so there's this interesting window there

1050
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,040
of of what is now

1051
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,680
or can you even find the now um as i

1052
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,960
think shanna argued in

1053
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,000
in her math stream daniel

1054
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
so stephen with a sports example and

1055
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,359
that kind of relates us back to our uh

1056
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,160
the skilled

1057
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
performance discussions that we had

1058
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
previously so that reminds me of

1059
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
a bf skinner book beyond freedom and

1060
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,839
dignity

1061
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,240
where he's like if you imagine a

1062
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
situation where somebody is like

1063
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,480
unconscious or um they're forced to do

1064
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
something you don't give them that much

1065
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,920
agency or autonomy

1066
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,200
but then in the uh situations that look

1067
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,119
unprompted like somebody walking up on

1068
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,720
stage then playing like a

1069
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
violin performance which is still a

1070
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
mechanical performance

1071
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,520
we regard that highly and we

1072
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,280
shower that with the um sort of

1073
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
aura of agency so he was kind of

1074
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
questioning that from his own

1075
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,920
behaviorist perspective and it's just

1076
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
kind of cool to think about how

1077
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,400
active inference and multi-scale systems

1078
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,079
those same questions come up

1079
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,000
like there are cases where things seem

1080
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
really constrained as far as actions are

1081
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,960
concerned

1082
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
and then there's other times where

1083
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
behavior just seems like come out of

1084
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,720
nowhere

1085
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
from by like a bird song or something

1086
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
like that so

1087
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
having a framework for behavior that can

1088
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,440
connect

1089
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,599
the thoughts across those isolated

1090
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,800
occurrences

1091
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,839
is really promising

1092
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,280
nice and yeah we've talked about

1093
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
planning as inference and really

1094
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
the author brings up here um planning in

1095
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,440
relation to

1096
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,720
the homeostatic space right so so

1097
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,520
really this might be the first like like

1098
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
how planning came to be

1099
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,720
is like planning for some potential

1100
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
state that is not my ideal homeostatic

1101
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,520
space steven

1102
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
yeah both a good point yeah because if

1103
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,839
it's already my ideal homeostatic space

1104
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
why use all that energy valuable energy

1105
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,359
to try and predict it when it's already

1106
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
being done quite well and like

1107
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,640
daniel was saying there about skillful

1108
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,319
performance i mean

1109
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,319
once you get into this groove and

1110
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,240
someone's in the zone

1111
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
you know more and more of the processes

1112
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,319
have probably been taken care of by

1113
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,079
morphological computing which is

1114
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,119
basically the cellular processes and

1115
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,520
then when it's at these other temporal

1116
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,160
depths

1117
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,440
i i'm predicting and just getting right

1118
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
the emphasis on the third note

1119
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,280
before the crescendo or whatever it is

1120
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,560
you know it may be that in some ways

1121
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,839
when you're in the flow

1122
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,440
which is that term when people are kind

1123
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
of immersed in an experience

1124
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,280
you know are you in some ways less

1125
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,839
conscious of

1126
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,319
more rapid dynamics and

1127
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,960
uh if without getting into a debate

1128
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,160
about consciousness i think we've got

1129
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,520
enough on the table but

1130
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,480
um but just just that question about um

1131
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:16,880
yes

1132
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
it is it is encompassing many more areas

1133
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,480
of what we've talked about than that

1134
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,000
first

1135
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
had been apparent

1136
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
nice and this touches on memory also so

1137
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,160
i flipped over to that slide

1138
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,200
scott you know it's interesting that

1139
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,280
notion just a minute ago about being in

1140
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
an optimal

1141
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,480
or zone space um i heard somebody

1142
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
quote somebody a few years ago was

1143
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
talking about different personalities

1144
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,359
where some people

1145
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,440
like the social equivalent of classical

1146
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
music and some people like the social

1147
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,720
equivalent of jazz

1148
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,079
and so the people like the social

1149
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,599
equivalent of classical music want to

1150
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,960
hang out with the same people

1151
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,839
all the time and then oh bill how's

1152
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,920
bill's drinking problem going oh how's

1153
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,560
mary's

1154
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
you know uh kids doing you know it's the

1155
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
same story just incremental changes

1156
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,640
kind of like if you hear beethoven's

1157
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
fifth and it's like

1158
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,000
you're like whoa that's slightly off

1159
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because your expectation is different

1160
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,079
whereas jazz you don't know what it's

1161
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,599
gonna be

1162
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,560
boop just all different things right so

1163
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,680
it's kind of interesting what your

1164
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
expectations are and what that

1165
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
optimization

1166
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,839
is jazz is a different kind of

1167
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,359
optimization right

1168
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,160
and so it made me think about the

1169
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
anterior

1170
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,079
cingulate nucleus my understanding is

1171
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,599
that's the part of the brain that if

1172
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,160
you're

1173
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,880
eating at a ripe berry bush and enjoying

1174
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,280
ripe

1175
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,760
berries the anterior cingulate nucleus

1176
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,119
if it fires off

1177
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,000
will make you think huh i wonder if

1178
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,839
there's a riper berry

1179
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,440
on the next bush and so it's the and and

1180
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:49,680
i

1181
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,000
i call it the commitment area where men

1182
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
can't commit to a relationship i believe

1183
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,280
it's probably the anterior cingulate

1184
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,640
nucleus they're looking for a riper

1185
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,079
berry so to speak

1186
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,440
so so that i wonder

1187
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,920
if there's an interesting rand i'll use

1188
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,480
a notion of random number generation

1189
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,200
here but

1190
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,760
it's probably not that but if there's a

1191
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,680
randomness factor that is

1192
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,000
in your optimum so is your state when

1193
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,839
it's optimized

1194
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,079
what is there something in the model

1195
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,760
itself that can throw randomness in

1196
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,160
there besides the externality

1197
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,079
so that and then you become like a

1198
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,400
novelty seeking person who has a highly

1199
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,119
active anterior cingulate nucleus

1200
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,200
is that an optimization which is

1201
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,880
superior for instance if you have a

1202
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,920
changing highly

1203
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
rapidly changing environment things like

1204
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,000
that just a couple of thoughts on

1205
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,040
optimization and what the zone might

1206
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,560
look like in different settings for

1207
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,119
different

1208
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,480
embodiments yeah that reminds me like

1209
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,359
i mean it's like a life plan or like an

1210
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,520
organismal life plan like some

1211
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
organisms like have to be in their niche

1212
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,640
environment like you can never

1213
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,720
take them out but then like some

1214
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
organisms like prepare for maximum

1215
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,760
randomness like i think about a

1216
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,560
tardigrade

1217
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,760
you know like you can do anything to

1218
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,359
them like you can dehydrate them and

1219
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,640
send them to the moon and

1220
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,560
have them come back and all these things

1221
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,160
but but they are they're

1222
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,079
you know built they're well suited for

1223
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,000
maximum randomness

1224
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,760
daniel i liked scott's

1225
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,599
point there about the genre of

1226
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,839
optimization um

1227
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,520
i'm i'm personally always surprised

1228
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,359
listening to both jazz and

1229
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,119
classical it's just that it's a

1230
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,520
different genre and so

1231
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
a musician in either or both of those

1232
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,800
areas though would have like a deep

1233
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,079
enough generative model

1234
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,079
to know when one thing was off by even a

1235
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,480
tiny bit even in a song that might sound

1236
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,119
like

1237
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,480
um discordant to somebody from

1238
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,160
because the improvisation tradition of

1239
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,079
one genre like might be

1240
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,880
more uh i don't know non-linear in some

1241
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,680
way

1242
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,240
but definitely this idea of like having

1243
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,359
interpretable

1244
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,079
or experienceable ways of interacting

1245
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:54,720
with

1246
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,240
different optimization processes

1247
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
different distributed processes

1248
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,680
are there more jazz like or more

1249
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,359
classical like

1250
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,760
uh collective behaviors and then also

1251
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,960
this broader

1252
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,200
question that is returned to centrally

1253
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
which is like that cognition

1254
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,160
is related to individuality that's

1255
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,880
really uh relevant for talking about

1256
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,960
where is cognition offloaded or how does

1257
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
cognition offload into the environment

1258
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,400
through development like through

1259
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,079
modification of the niche

1260
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,480
and then also through evolution where

1261
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,000
also the niche can be modified in the

1262
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,760
long term but

1263
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,119
evolution can select for like

1264
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,440
canalization so stabilization

1265
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,599
of things that were accessed plastically

1266
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,480
in one generation

1267
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,400
nice stephen and then scott

1268
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,079
yeah i mean falling in on what you're

1269
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,839
saying about the environment and and the

1270
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,560
jazz and classical um

1271
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
i used to live in prague for for a year

1272
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,560
or so and and what was interesting there

1273
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,079
so you've got a lot of classical music

1274
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,640
venues and operas and you've got

1275
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,480
lots of jazz as well but they're very

1276
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,240
different spaces as well right you've

1277
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,440
got the basement

1278
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,240
jazz bar in some cellar and you've got

1279
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
so there's a question as well about

1280
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,880
yeah once when you start going to one or

1281
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,079
the other you probably will keep going

1282
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,760
to one or the other for a while

1283
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,680
if that makes sense you sort of even

1284
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,079
though so beyond the music once you yeah

1285
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,599
there is a kind of um

1286
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,680
a dynamic because those those two are

1287
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,800
fairly clear it's

1288
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,640
relatively extremes i suppose even

1289
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,920
though they're both what you would call

1290
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,800
high art

1291
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,119
um in some ways as well so you've got

1292
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,800
that interesting

1293
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,079
thing about how you bring in the

1294
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,440
environment and that's one thing active

1295
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,720
inference does which

1296
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,640
many forms of psychology and that don't

1297
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,920
is how much is it about

1298
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,640
changing your generative model and how

1299
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,319
or how much is it about another model

1300
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:38,800
about

1301
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,480
choosing your environment and letting

1302
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
the environment do a lot of the

1303
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,400
uh motivating for you um so that's

1304
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,880
interesting i was just also on a call

1305
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,839
um about metaphors and andrew austin who

1306
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,920
does that work he talks about

1307
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,319
if you want to motivate yourself it's

1308
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,599
actually easier to change your

1309
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,200
environment

1310
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,680
it's an externality that can be helpful

1311
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,720
if you want to

1312
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,079
change your choice making that can be

1313
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,720
internal so like don't try and choose

1314
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
get others to make better choices

1315
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,800
make better choices yourself you might

1316
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,640
not be able to motivate yourself maybe

1317
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,040
find things out there that help motivate

1318
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,760
you

1319
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,079
so in the same way that you know maybe

1320
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,440
that's good if i want to get a more

1321
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,599
ordered kind of structured view of the

1322
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,040
world for a while maybe i'll start going

1323
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,960
to some classical concerts for a while

1324
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,440
if i want to release and start sort of

1325
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,040
being more free-flowing maybe i'll go

1326
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
and watch some jazz

1327
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,720
um so anyway kind of interesting

1328
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,880
thanks scott i love all of you i gotta

1329
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,280
say

1330
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,119
this is i mean it's been a few weeks

1331
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,480
since i've been able to be

1332
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,200
on the calls just for different reasons

1333
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,319
and this is

1334
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,240
beautiful it's such a beautiful thing

1335
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,440
okay so

1336
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
so i was just showing you my tardigrade

1337
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,119
banjo ukulele which is what i was

1338
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,480
holding up to the screen so that's a

1339
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,839
target painted

1340
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,680
a couple of things so you know it's

1341
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,280
interesting love the last couple of

1342
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,359
comments and that notion of

1343
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,480
um access to other

1344
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,720
right and that kind of recreational and

1345
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,839
de-risking access to the other right you

1346
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,680
want to know the externality

1347
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
because you want to render it innocuous

1348
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,599
for survival purposes

1349
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,160
and then render it delicious for

1350
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,359
aesthetic purposes

1351
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,599
right and so a couple of books this is

1352
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,359
the the past is a foreign country

1353
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,839
by lowenthal which is kind of like okay

1354
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:32,800
temporally

1355
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,400
the assertion in the book is the past

1356
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,920
actually isn't a foreign country they're

1357
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,559
the same

1358
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,800
it's us right and so the same thing

1359
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,760
temporally

1360
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,160
oh they're so different oh that's other

1361
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
right oh we've come beyond this

1362
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,680
but that's our own aspiration then

1363
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,960
another book

1364
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,880
introduction to comparative study of

1365
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,440
private law comparative law you got

1366
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,800
in law and language i my assertion that

1367
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,040
the mind exists in language and the

1368
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
brain is just an antenna tuned to it

1369
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,000
well law is a formalization of language

1370
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,079
and understanding so you have again

1371
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,599
comparative study there's another book i

1372
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,359
have i couldn't put my hands on

1373
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,359
it's the cambridge handbook of

1374
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,760
adaptation studies in theater

1375
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,000
and the articles on how do you adapt

1376
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,079
german theater for a greek

1377
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,880
audience or whatever right so all these

1378
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,319
things

1379
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,760
there's a exotic element to it

1380
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,200
right and which is both threatening and

1381
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,119
reaffirming and delicious

1382
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,240
and scary right and so

1383
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,480
these isn't it interesting that those

1384
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,040
states

1385
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,839
are we other than novelty

1386
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,680
perceiving either by resistance or

1387
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,280
seeking is is that the essence of

1388
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,359
consciousness and so if you had the

1389
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,440
equivalent of isothermy

1390
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,839
where you had it in isotherm you have

1391
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,079
temperature equivalence in two systems

1392
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,599
and you can't perform work because

1393
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,200
there's no temperature differential heat

1394
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,480
differentials

1395
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,240
well what if we had no meaning

1396
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,599
differential

1397
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,280
between two systems is that describable

1398
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,359
vis-a-vis that variable as one system

1399
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,760
and is that something that starts to get

1400
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,839
to you sociality

1401
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,119
or shared narrative and is that why

1402
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,359
that becomes so existential because the

1403
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,160
reinforcements of that becomes

1404
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,400
the amplifying wave essentially the

1405
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,240
amplifying embodiment

1406
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,440
becomes so powerful that it overtakes

1407
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,079
the system the system has no other

1408
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,280
internal state that's as reinforced and

1409
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,400
as amplified

1410
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,839
so therefore that one becomes

1411
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,920
overwhelming and maybe that's a source

1412
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,400
of why it's hard to crack misinformation

1413
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,760
by feeding fact or something like that

1414
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,359
anyway just a couple of random thoughts

1415
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,160
there

1416
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,880
really nice scott i um took the tony

1417
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,520
robbins

1418
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,119
test one time like what's your driving

1419
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,040
force in life and i'm totally driven by

1420
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
instability which makes me like a a

1421
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,400
desperate novelty

1422
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,000
seeking person um and i'm also reminded

1423
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in your points about language i've been

1424
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,680
thinking a lot about language

1425
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,359
because of some projects i'm involved in

1426
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,520
and uh i was listening to

1427
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,800
josh tanenbaum speak yesterday about

1428
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,480
his um like uh program that he developed

1429
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,359
it's like a

1430
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,280
neural network neural network like a

1431
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
sleep wake helmholtz machine

1432
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,079
that actually like composes language i

1433
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:28,800
mean it doesn't

1434
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,200
it does some like phone numbers and it

1435
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,800
but it writes code like computer

1436
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,680
programs

1437
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,000
um and you know it draws symbols and it

1438
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,680
does these cool like things

1439
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,720
based on a framework that's um you know

1440
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,319
kind of analogous to

1441
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,040
active inference where the exploration

1442
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,680
phase

1443
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,920
happens in the sleep phase of the

1444
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,880
machine so

1445
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,119
exploration is like this recombination

1446
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,880
of all of the potential

1447
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,960
like factors right so like in the

1448
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,800
training phase it's it's trained on you

1449
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
know constructs the generative model

1450
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,040
or it constructs the recognition model

1451
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,720
based on all of the training input like

1452
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,240
if it's drawings it's going to be all of

1453
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,559
like

1454
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,880
you know potential shapes and then it

1455
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,160
recombines these

1456
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,920
while it thinks about recombining them

1457
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,200
to kind of become

1458
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,960
a field expert it was really an

1459
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,400
interesting paper

1460
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,000
uh sorry to detour there daniel

1461
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,520
you you go for it scott and then i'll

1462
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,280
give a thought

1463
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,319
uh thanks yeah just that's fantastic and

1464
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,599
it makes me think one of the things i've

1465
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,960
been fussing with for a while

1466
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,960
and you probably heard me say it is that

1467
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,559
the mind does not exist

1468
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,839
in the brain it exists in language and

1469
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,599
culture and the brain is tuned to the

1470
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,680
mind and the example i give is my

1471
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,760
niece who was adopted from china at five

1472
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,720
months old

1473
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,760
now has graduated from cornell she's

1474
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,280
looks like a chinese person she doesn't

1475
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,640
speak chinese she doesn't like chinese

1476
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,400
food she doesn't like chinese music

1477
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,240
she speaks spanish and english and she's

1478
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,839
a central pennsylvania gal

1479
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,800
right so her mind was not there's no

1480
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,000
feral consciousness

1481
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,240
and her mind was developed in central

1482
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,280
pennsylvania

1483
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,160
so what it makes me think what you were

1484
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
just saying is so interesting

1485
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,040
so maybe the mind where maybe our models

1486
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,920
are just so

1487
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,000
so much hubris there and we think the

1488
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,480
mind precedes communication

1489
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,119
and maybe it just doesn't maybe it is no

1490
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,400
mind affordance

1491
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
other than communication and language so

1492
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,559
like plato when he said

1493
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,240
the reason that authors were the

1494
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,760
challenge is you couldn't query the

1495
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,359
consciousness of the author

1496
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,480
maybe it was an even a deeper comment

1497
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,160
about mind that the the queering of

1498
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,960
consciousness

1499
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,160
is mind itself and so maybe active

1500
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,119
inference

1501
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,680
is the function of mind it's not a mind

1502
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,720
seeking to

1503
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,160
to refine its state more but it is the

1504
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,440
fact of mind

1505
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,520
is the the act of active inference

1506
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,359
it just feels that was that was a shift

1507
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,040
that i hadn't thought about before

1508
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,839
and it gets away from centralizing mind

1509
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,160
in

1510
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
individual brains that then come in

1511
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,839
contact to try to fix up their models

1512
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,000
and rather putting situating mind in the

1513
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,160
edge itself not the node from a graph

1514
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,359
theory perspective

1515
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,720
that's fascinating stuff uh

1516
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,839
daniel and then dave

1517
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,319
yep to kind of bring it to active

1518
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,319
inference but really just any kind of

1519
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,880
dynamical modeling we shouldn't let this

1520
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,599
like snapshot

1521
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,000
govern the way that the system works

1522
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,839
because systems change through time

1523
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,720
so they're not just the snapshot picture

1524
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,319
maybe the prevalence of photography

1525
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,160
makes it easier sometimes to

1526
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,960
imagine this sort of snap shotting and

1527
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,359
yes

1528
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,839
active inference is hopefully providing

1529
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,119
a way to just

1530
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,640
think about it again whether

1531
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,160
instrumentally or more

1532
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,160
in this sort of like philosophical or

1533
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,200
metaphysical

1534
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,319
way which everyone is welcome

1535
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,240
to do but the actual uh core

1536
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,520
is just going to be leading to many

1537
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,480
questions for a long time

1538
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,880
dave one of the yeah one of the uh

1539
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,000
environments that is extraordinarily

1540
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,640
powerful

1541
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,119
at putting people in altered states of

1542
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:11,839
consciousness

1543
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,440
and especially distorting their time

1544
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,160
sense is a device an enter an

1545
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,160
entertainment device which was also

1546
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,240
a psychological research device called

1547
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,240
music color

1548
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,440
stephen may have seen references to that

1549
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,480
this was developed in the 1950s and

1550
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,960
was in some shows and clubs in london in

1551
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,280
the late 50s and early 60s

1552
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,200
um it's been mentioned a few times

1553
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,920
um andrew pickering mentions that a few

1554
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,680
other people in passing

1555
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,319
um and there was an exhibit that that

1556
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:46,839
was

1557
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,880
uh developed by the same engineer

1558
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,040
that tried to play in paris but got

1559
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,160
coveted out

1560
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,079
if none of you have seen that i should i

1561
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,240
have most of the material that's ever

1562
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,799
been captured as far as i can tell

1563
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:01,680
because it was

1564
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,920
a series of talks a series of literally

1565
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,799
chats

1566
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,200
uh um in the 1980s so i better gather

1567
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,920
that up

1568
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,960
and um it's all it's all in a single

1569
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,839
series on youtube that i have in a

1570
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,559
playlist

1571
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,319
so let's do that yeah the the guy would

1572
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,880
literally his musicians would believe

1573
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,640
that five minutes had passed when it was

1574
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,160
actually eight hours they had been

1575
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,920
playing solos

1576
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,599
for 10 hours at night risking a rest for

1577
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,559
trespass

1578
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,640
when they thought oh no no the guard you

1579
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,160
know everybody's still here i've only

1580
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,720
been here 10 minutes buying my flute

1581
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,040
and people would get so spaced out they

1582
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,000
would

1583
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,119
drive their cars into the middle of

1584
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,559
roundabouts

1585
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,960
up on and bang into the posts because it

1586
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,040
just didn't occur to them not to do that

1587
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,680
or they'd they'd look into the the u

1588
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,000
tracks and watch the train come to them

1589
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,319
and

1590
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,000
if people hadn't grabbed them and pulled

1591
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,440
them off what were you doing

1592
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,880
what do you mean i was i was looking at

1593
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
the lights

1594
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,559
and no drugs and they had fun

1595
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,640
and the bystanders had no idea this was

1596
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,680
happening because the

1597
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,440
oh these guys are just playing jazz but

1598
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,920
no they were

1599
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,319
on cloud9 that's cool it reminds me of a

1600
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,599
virtual reality daniel

1601
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,799
so it's interesting that with

1602
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,640
frameworks for communication like active

1603
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,079
inference we can think about

1604
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,319
syntactic repetition like repeating the

1605
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,680
same word

1606
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,319
semantic repetition and novelty like

1607
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,520
somebody saying the same thing

1608
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,720
differently

1609
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,599
but also narrative novelty and uh

1610
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,480
similarity

1611
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,520
or at least consistency coherency and so

1612
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,920
the other piece from what scott had said

1613
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,359
earlier was

1614
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,119
going back to some of our earliest

1615
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,480
streams on

1616
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,559
narrative and communication as active

1617
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:53,599
inference

1618
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,760
there's a ton of ways to think about

1619
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,720
that like

1620
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,480
is narrative like a summary statistic

1621
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,799
of the agent-based generative models

1622
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,200
like you got 25 at this parameter and

1623
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,680
75 at this parameter and then narrative

1624
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,760
is just like a descriptive state

1625
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
but what happens when narratives or

1626
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,680
various representations of them

1627
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,079
can actually through mechanisms feedback

1628
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,200
onto sensory and therefore internal

1629
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,160
states

1630
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,400
so how do we think about narrative and

1631
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,760
active inference

1632
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,720
and narrative and communication as like

1633
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,160
higher order

1634
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,799
semantic structures that help reduce

1635
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,599
uncertainty

1636
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,839
allow for efficient information transfer

1637
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,200
all the imperatives of

1638
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,400
cell to cell communication bioelectric

1639
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,240
but it's happening on a spatial and a

1640
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,680
temporal scale

1641
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,680
that demands auditory transmission but

1642
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,000
of course can also be done electrically

1643
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,280
really nice scott

1644
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,000
this is i'm my again my face hurts from

1645
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,880
smiling

1646
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,520
so i so i had this book a rhetorical

1647
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,079
style

1648
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,280
it's called and it has dozens of

1649
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,000
rhetorical

1650
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,319
flourishes like the use of french

1651
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,520
suggests

1652
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,920
style and the use of german in words

1653
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,640
suggests

1654
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,640
engineering excellence and then there's

1655
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,920
different placements

1656
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,599
i mean it's just all these different

1657
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,119
ways to construct the sentence all these

1658
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,079
differences

1659
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,920
and it's so fascinating that notion that

1660
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,119
is that what what's the cellular

1661
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,240
equivalent of rhetoric

1662
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,599
right is that when a cell wants to

1663
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,160
persuade let's say there's a growing tip

1664
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,119
of a mesenchyme tissue or some whatever

1665
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,079
in a plant or

1666
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,480
a human whatever and it's then and

1667
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,559
there's a decision to be made based on a

1668
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,880
turing wave that's coming in and what

1669
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,720
finger orientation you have right and

1670
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,040
the

1671
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
turing wave responsible for finger

1672
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,440
growth there's a periodicity to the

1673
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,119
starting and stopping of the chemicals

1674
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,119
and that's why you have multiple fingers

1675
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,280
so what what's the

1676
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,480
notion of persuasion

1677
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,920
in non-human speech so a peacock's

1678
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,520
feathers are persuading the female

1679
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,640
of its fitness because the coloration

1680
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,520
one assertion is with coloration if it's

1681
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,359
a healthy looking color

1682
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,839
or the dance is healthily performed it

1683
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,599
suggests a healthy individual and that's

1684
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,440
persuasion for mating

1685
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,480
let's say i'm just asserting possible

1686
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,480
rhetoric

1687
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,839
and is all communication

1688
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:39,760
rhetorical in that it's made to persuade

1689
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,400
and the persuasion is not necessarily in

1690
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,440
the

1691
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
it may be in the self-interest of both

1692
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,720
the speaker

1693
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,079
and the externality right because

1694
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,240
i'm talking about situations where

1695
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,079
you're running an internal model

1696
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,240
and you're trying to recruit other

1697
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,920
internal models which are your

1698
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,520
externality but for other people are

1699
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,119
there into or other things are there

1700
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,640
internal models right

1701
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,319
and so if you want to get some

1702
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,680
externality that's an

1703
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,640
organism to do something consistent with

1704
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,319
your model you need to

1705
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,599
er entrain them harmonically couple with

1706
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,559
them

1707
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,880
so is rhetoric what's the equivalent of

1708
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,680
rhetoric in

1709
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,599
other non-i guess non-language systems i

1710
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:24,559
use the word language

1711
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,480
in non-human language systems

1712
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,799
really nice um and i'm reminded of uh

1713
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,720
well it made me think of how does the

1714
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,319
narrative play across

1715
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,640
scales really like from the cellular to

1716
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,160
the organ level to the organism all

1717
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,079
stephen yeah i think that

1718
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,319
also bringing that into what daniel was

1719
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,599
saying was structure

1720
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,720
and narrative so there's um and actually

1721
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
that i just looking that up that color

1722
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,799
you know the color and how that wheel

1723
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,000
relates to sound

1724
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,480
music um so you've got these questions

1725
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,640
of when do structures start to be

1726
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,599
present

1727
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,799
that gives something else another type

1728
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
of geometry and where is that

1729
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,119
present so it could literally be um

1730
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,400
there could be a type of geometric space

1731
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
in the way the neurons have arranged

1732
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,839
themselves and that

1733
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,799
could be a certain level at which

1734
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,200
they're getting fed in

1735
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,920
embodied information about light sources

1736
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,280
so it will only really happen when

1737
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:25,839
you've got an

1738
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,880
eye that's measuring light data that

1739
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,359
then

1740
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,039
starts to structure itself in that form

1741
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,960
and that could then underneath so and

1742
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,400
that could also apply to

1743
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,160
there may be a sort of a quality to the

1744
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,680
way sound is

1745
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,839
based on it being a whole level of you

1746
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,200
know hertz

1747
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,000
or half levels of hurts and half tones

1748
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
so there's something around i think

1749
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,000
there's an interesting

1750
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,039
point around when we have structure

1751
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,680
and we then this rhetorical piece may

1752
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,680
happen once we can

1753
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,280
oh crikey yeah so you got that as well

1754
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,039
the hell so you've got you've got you've

1755
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,720
got then you've got systems that we can

1756
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,400
see now the question with rhetorical

1757
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,200
stuff is

1758
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,359
is rhetorical stuff the stuff that we

1759
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,720
can see as a system

1760
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,319
that you can then argue your point you

1761
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,079
know some sort of way this and i suppose

1762
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,680
at another level the cells could come to

1763
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,880
a point where they could

1764
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,760
argue a case with each other and so

1765
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,680
there's some system in place that sits

1766
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,119
on that structure

1767
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,039
but the thing that always is in the

1768
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,240
background which is

1769
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,160
again what i was saying earlier most

1770
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,440
people doing systems

1771
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,680
don't think about when they talk about

1772
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,200
emergence

1773
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,839
they is is there some sort of swarming

1774
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,599
dynamics happening

1775
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,720
now whether this bioelectric stuff

1776
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,359
sits and adds a new layer i mean i

1777
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,880
noticed on one of the slides there it

1778
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,960
talked about kind of like a new layer

1779
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,160
of um uh like does this add a new layer

1780
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,319
to um to to this dynamic and i'm

1781
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,039
i'm curious about whether that your

1782
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,079
thoughts on that

1783
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,119
in in the sense of um

1784
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,280
you know do you do you see this as being

1785
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,160
an a new

1786
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,119
layer that's been added or is this

1787
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,480
somehow

1788
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,480
something which builds a bridge to the

1789
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,839
way the structures could

1790
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,880
emerge at the swarming um

1791
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,520
is it because it talks about memory i

1792
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,960
know yet the slide that talks about

1793
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,559
memory i can't quite find which one it

1794
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,440
is now but

1795
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,319
one of the slides talks about memory is

1796
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:26,880
that

1797
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,280
significant in allowing the structuring

1798
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,079
to happen

1799
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,599
you know is it something about forming

1800
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,359
that memory in that structure

1801
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,119
or does the structure need to be there

1802
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,880
first i'm sort of putting that out to us

1803
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,520
and i don't know whether that's

1804
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,839
something we could ask michael but

1805
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,400
and maybe just refine that thought but

1806
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,760
it seems to be

1807
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,599
something which is a question that

1808
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,359
relates to how this all fits together

1809
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,000
nice dave

1810
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,359
yeah for scott um if you want to see

1811
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,039
how rhetoric is founded

1812
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,559
in the basic emotions and also get an

1813
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,640
evolutionary

1814
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,720
biological evolutionary perspective on

1815
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,119
that read the chapter on

1816
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,839
play in yak poncep's

1817
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,480
affective neuroscience

1818
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,240
and once you've gotten through that look

1819
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,960
at the later piaget's later work

1820
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,599
on the role of play when he really got

1821
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,839
very subtle about the socialization and

1822
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:32,400
how

1823
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,160
how kids uh use play to

1824
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,119
become very expert in the in the ideal

1825
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,000
case

1826
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,240
in role taking and the creation of

1827
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,359
uh uh social uh relations and

1828
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,359
being able to play without anybody's

1829
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,640
feelings getting hurt and so on

1830
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,920
yeah the the concept of play i think is

1831
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,119
really important

1832
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,839
um in the space of active inference

1833
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,640
because it really

1834
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,000
kind of represents that that exploratory

1835
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,200
component

1836
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,598
scott

1837
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,839
i'll give a thought while he stepped

1838
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,520
away it was related to his

1839
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,520
point about persuasion so if anything

1840
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,440
it's not going to be a binary it's going

1841
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,760
to be first off instrumental it's about

1842
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,280
how it's being modeled we're not looking

1843
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,319
for something that we're going to see

1844
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,680
under a microscope or it

1845
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,440
wouldn't even matter if we could we're

1846
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,119
talking about categorization

1847
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,880
so that we can reduce our uncertainty

1848
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,160
about action

1849
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,280
so the models that we set up could be a

1850
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,799
binary state model or not

1851
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,000
and that wouldn't be a metaphysical

1852
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,559
claim but just thinking about it as

1853
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,880
far as biological systems are concerned

1854
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,480
and taking it to that sort of like

1855
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,440
cellular

1856
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,000
level like what if one molecule is

1857
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,880
secreted

1858
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,599
that sensitizes the cell to a second

1859
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,400
molecule

1860
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,480
you know is that type of sequencing

1861
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,640
would that be considered a minimal

1862
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,520
viable rhetoric or intracellular

1863
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,799
narrative

1864
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,799
and uh just made me think about how

1865
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,400
there's sort of different types of

1866
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,520
interactions

1867
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,640
and that they convey different

1868
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,799
information something that

1869
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,359
my advisor professor gordon really

1870
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,960
explored a lot in the ant colony

1871
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,760
case how different types of interactions

1872
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,079
just

1873
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,160
update how likely an individual is to do

1874
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,599
different kinds of actions

1875
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,520
and that's seen across systems so

1876
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,440
sometimes that's just a simple enough

1877
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,760
statement like there's symbols that we

1878
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,880
see you know

1879
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,520
one or fifty or a thousand times a day

1880
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,880
and then there's things that are more

1881
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,079
explicitly

1882
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,880
narrated more rarely so then in the case

1883
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,240
of the human culture human narratives

1884
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,400
it just opens up the design space

1885
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,440
because there's multiple kinds of

1886
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,000
interactions

1887
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,839
nice scott did you want to give a

1888
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
thought yeah a couple of things that is

1889
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,839
really nice daniel that's like kind of

1890
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:54,559
the notion

1891
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,440
in introducing something like discretion

1892
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,280
in a sense

1893
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,359
so if a system is

1894
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,880
running a let's let's call it active

1895
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,520
inference

1896
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,359
that running that model are they

1897
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,599
are they bringing their model to bear on

1898
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,359
the environment

1899
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,719
because it embodies the information

1900
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,319
of their past genetically and

1901
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,279
epigenetically and behaviorally

1902
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,359
so a three-legged dog is it running with

1903
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,040
three legs just because now it has three

1904
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,238
legs and that's it that's the affordance

1905
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,238
or or is there discretion

1906
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,640
in the active part of active inference

1907
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,600
that may be an interesting dividing

1908
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,399
point

1909
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,279
in terms of rhetoric is rhetoric can

1910
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,040
rhetoric be a persuasion

1911
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,560
brought by and thing that's intrinsic so

1912
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,120
a tiger jumps in front of me on a path

1913
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,719
and i'm walking

1914
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,600
the tiger is ferocious because it's an

1915
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,719
apex predator

1916
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,839
and has big teeth and i'm not is the

1917
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:02,319
tiger

1918
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,799
exercising discretion on being ferocious

1919
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:05,520
or is it just

1920
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,560
intrinsically ferocious to me

1921
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,880
right so is so that's that to me that

1922
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,479
feels like there may be something there

1923
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,679
on rhetoric

1924
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,319
if there's a choice maybe that the

1925
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,000
organism has

1926
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,640
or choices not maybe maybe the

1927
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,839
organism's not a single

1928
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:25,040
individual maybe it's a hive so

1929
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,719
that's one thing then that gets to that

1930
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,158
quorum sensing

1931
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:31,600
which is really rhetorical argument

1932
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,439
seems like it's because there there's a

1933
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,520
choice shall we

1934
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,359
swarm or not now when it's locusts and

1935
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,158
it's a pheromone for gregariousness

1936
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,158
right that's what switches the pheromone

1937
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,600
switches on and off when they're in

1938
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,040
close contact

1939
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,679
so question is is that a discretionary

1940
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,520
thing when there's a pheromone

1941
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,600
impact you know again it doesn't have to

1942
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,760
be in either or it's just that maybe

1943
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,520
there's gradations of discretion that

1944
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,800
are exercised

1945
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,360
in different ways and so the other then

1946
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,400
it gets to me

1947
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,159
to get to synesthesia so

1948
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,600
if i could sense something um i could

1949
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,800
make a decision but

1950
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,280
instead i'm fed a pheromone that makes

1951
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,159
me fee

1952
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,719
make a decision without my conscious

1953
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:17,360
awareness

1954
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,080
is that still rhetoric and is that a

1955
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,159
quorum if it's a non-conscious

1956
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,880
quorum maybe it's a different state when

1957
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,080
it's non-conscious

1958
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,840
and also when you have internal

1959
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,280
synesthesia one of the things that's

1960
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,040
fascinating to me i once heard that

1961
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,960
the assertion that people with perfect

1962
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,360
pitch might be synesthetes

1963
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,600
because they're perceiving sound as

1964
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,480
color for instance and they can discern

1965
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,440
colors more readily in their mental

1966
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,560
capacity

1967
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
so therefore they can discern the notes

1968
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,239
better than people who can't discern

1969
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,320
notes as color

1970
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,400
so again all those things feel like they

1971
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,679
work together

1972
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,719
in terms of is the consciousness that's

1973
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,800
held is the mind

1974
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,920
held in the individual brain of an

1975
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,600
individual organism

1976
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,199
and or in the communications among the

1977
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,400
organisms

1978
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,880
and so maybe that takes the rhetoric

1979
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,080
question and renders it

1980
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,600
a nullity because maybe it's degrees

1981
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,440
of quorum that resemble discretion

1982
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,600
and maybe the internal acts of

1983
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,040
discretion are merely

1984
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,640
priors that were learned from an

1985
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,400
externality anyway anyway a few thoughts

1986
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,320
yeah i'm really reminded scott and this

1987
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,440
is going to turn you

1988
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,440
up a lot this is going to turn up your

1989
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,120
volume a lot

1990
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,719
the uh so i just learned about the work

1991
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:39,440
of um

1992
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,920
asifa majeed i'm not sure if i'm saying

1993
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,040
her name right but

1994
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,280
she does this amazing work on language

1995
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,360
how language shapes thought and how she

1996
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:47,920
thought

1997
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,960
shapes language um and she looks at at

1998
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,800
like in cultures they have you know

1999
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,040
there's was one i think it's the jahi

2000
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,159
culture they have like

2001
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,040
17 different kinds of smells that they

2002
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,800
like smell and it's like you know one of

2003
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,840
them is like

2004
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,520
i mean we don't have words for smell we

2005
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,760
just have it smells like a rose or it

2006
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,360
smells like meat or

2007
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,199
whatever so she you know but they have

2008
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,880
actual in their vernacular

2009
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,800
they have different words for different

2010
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,000
smells and and

2011
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,239
like in english we have you know a

2012
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,239
gazillion words for color but like in

2013
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,440
some cultures the color

2014
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,719
blue and green are the same so so uh

2015
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,520
and you know it's the words for like one

2016
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,199
that was super amazing like we have all

2017
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,440
this word for like fingertip fingernail

2018
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,640
uh finger hand forearm bicep like

2019
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,280
a shoulder i mean all of this in some

2020
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,480
cultures is one word

2021
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,719
your entire arm every part of it like so

2022
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,920
you don't discern

2023
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,360
that there's no difference between your

2024
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,280
thumb and your shoulder like that's wild

2025
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,080
to me right

2026
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,679
and so how does that that shape the way

2027
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,440
that we think about it uh sorry if i'm

2028
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,679
rambling daniel

2029
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,199
no fun points so as far as how

2030
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,520
connectivity of communications related

2031
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,719
to rhetorical

2032
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,600
outcomes rhetorical ecosystems i think

2033
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,239
there

2034
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,080
an analogy to look for would be in the

2035
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,320
connectivity of brain regions and

2036
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,719
of course in the spm toolkit and the

2037
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,400
dynamic causal modeling that we

2038
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,719
referenced a bit earlier because there's

2039
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,000
brain regions that are

2040
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,880
anatomically connected so whether

2041
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,480
they're next-door cells or whether

2042
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,320
there's a long-range connection

2043
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
and then there's also like functional

2044
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,080
and effective connectivity which are

2045
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,679
different ways of looking at the

2046
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:26,239
signal of dynamical data and then

2047
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,360
drawing edges

2048
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,280
in a network where the nodes are the

2049
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,880
regions and then the edges reflect like

2050
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,280
a dynamical correlation or

2051
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,360
grainger causation which does of course

2052
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,199
bring it into this whole

2053
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,960
dynamic causal modeling the whole

2054
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,320
question about multi-level

2055
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,679
cause cause across different uh

2056
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,040
parts of a system that aren't directly

2057
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,679
touching is it just our physicalism and

2058
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,360
our assumptions of materialism

2059
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,800
that like require something to be

2060
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,280
touching to have a direct influence

2061
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,000
is it just some sort of anti-you know

2062
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,520
non-locality

2063
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,640
type stance that's very deep prior is

2064
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,719
that something that when relaxed

2065
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,280
provides useful solutions or just ones

2066
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,000
that are

2067
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,679
a bit less susceptible to one argument

2068
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,880
but totally susceptible to other

2069
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,920
arguments

2070
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,159
nice questions very nice uh

2071
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,360
stephen and then dave

2072
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,120
yeah this idea like you the the question

2073
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
about structure and the relationship

2074
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,600
between

2075
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,040
how things can relate or touch i think

2076
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,480
it makes uh

2077
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
the way that we bring in date our

2078
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
sensorial information

2079
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,000
and these cones in a way with a cell you

2080
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,199
kind of

2081
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,280
each cell presumably can have this

2082
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,360
perception that can extend

2083
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,199
we have these multiple threads of

2084
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,640
perception that come in you know we've

2085
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,080
got the visual perception we've got the

2086
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
auditory perception we've got

2087
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,480
and then how do we structure our

2088
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,520
narratives

2089
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,280
well if we have a culture which

2090
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,520
structures the ability to

2091
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,600
smell think about smell in that sort of

2092
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,080
refined way compared to

2093
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,000
us who maybe gets very involved in the

2094
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,159
musculature and the nail and the

2095
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,840
you know the amount of time people spend

2096
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,360
now on their nails you know

2097
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,800
in in in our culture so that will change

2098
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,320
the structure of the narratives that

2099
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,520
you're going to tell each other

2100
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,159
and um that would be interesting and i

2101
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,000
actually just did a laban

2102
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,560
laban dance sort of workshop recently

2103
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,600
and they have

2104
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,280
they did the verticalities one of them

2105
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,679
like you've got the base which is the uh

2106
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,159
the feet and the floor you've got the

2107
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,080
bowl of the pelvis that you can sort of

2108
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,400
rock on you've got the diaphragm

2109
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,679
you've got the base of the mouth and

2110
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,280
you've got the top of the head as if

2111
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,800
they're almost different

2112
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,320
ways of grounding your ways of being

2113
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,120
right and as you go up and down i think

2114
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,840
that again

2115
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,600
speaks to that structuring how much

2116
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,600
would that change the structure of

2117
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,040
the narrative and that would change the

2118
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,719
structure of the memory

2119
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,480
and how does that structure of memory

2120
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,320
play into the structure and memory in

2121
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,199
this

2122
01:15:55,199 --> 01:16:00,000
paper you know could be interesting

2123
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,719
nice dave

2124
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,080
yeah the uh different ways of

2125
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,000
structuring language are

2126
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,960
quite striking to me my um tagalog is

2127
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,640
just dramatically different

2128
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,520
in the way it expresses ideas from the

2129
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,960
european languages

2130
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,239
there's no gender for instance um

2131
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,080
there are three cases nominative

2132
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,440
genitive and

2133
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,920
ablative and almost everything is

2134
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,719
expressed in

2135
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,960
all circumstances expects expressed in

2136
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,840
the ablative

2137
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,199
so where

2138
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,880
when for what purpose by means of what

2139
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,600
for whose benefit that's all just

2140
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,679
expressed by putting

2141
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,239
however many of those causes there are

2142
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,920
into the ablative and if you need to be

2143
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,199
specific

2144
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,440
you throw particles in but they're

2145
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,960
always optional

2146
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,440
so uh if you challenge somebody well how

2147
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,040
do you know whether you're

2148
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,239
you know how what something means in

2149
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,640
in a sentence so well isn't it obvious

2150
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,520
if i talk about

2151
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,960
monday that when you translate it to

2152
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,840
english you'd say

2153
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,440
on and when we're saying when i'm saying

2154
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,440
at new york of course you would

2155
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,840
translate that to

2156
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,760
in and uh

2157
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,679
for well of course you translate it

2158
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,520
forth but when our before our son had

2159
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,360
been in the u.s for a long time he was

2160
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,480
constantly using this at

2161
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,280
for everything at three o'clock at

2162
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,719
manhattan

2163
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,640
at um pittsburgh

2164
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,320
at my girlfriend anything

2165
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,440
other than who's doing the action but

2166
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,960
who's doing the action isn't

2167
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,560
expressed in a straightforward way

2168
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,159
either so it's it's

2169
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,960
it's pretty wacky

2170
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,120
cool nice thoughts yeah

2171
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,360
sorry pretty wacky is what anybody with

2172
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,159
a highly precise language like russian

2173
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,440
or chinese would say you know when they

2174
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,440
hear somebody speaking even careful

2175
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,280
english this is wait a minute you had a

2176
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,040
not in your sense what is it exactly

2177
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,480
that you're negating

2178
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,000
there's no way to tell what an english

2179
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
speaker means once he's put not into a

2180
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,199
sense or in russian

2181
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,159
it's so strict and so specific same

2182
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:18,960
thing

2183
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,960
you know how do you know in english well

2184
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,560
you just figure it out

2185
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,040
what don't you just say what you mean no

2186
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,239
we don't

2187
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,199
let you figure that out definitely some

2188
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,440
ambiguity there i wonder like in cell to

2189
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,120
cell communication

2190
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,440
um if there's ambiguity like in in the

2191
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,400
bioelectric

2192
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,880
signal um like what which way does

2193
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,239
should a cell grow or go

2194
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,400
like touching back onto the the language

2195
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,159
of this multi-scale cognition

2196
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,920
daniel so i think to connect this uh

2197
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,040
language discussion to the um like

2198
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,520
the goal and the whole sensing point of

2199
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,800
the paper

2200
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,679
these different ways in which human

2201
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:58,560
languages

2202
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,880
are communicating state updates about

2203
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,000
the world

2204
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,159
people are able to live living people

2205
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,360
use all these languages

2206
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,960
so that says a lot it means they're able

2207
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,400
to be uptaken

2208
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,320
and transmitted by our cognitive

2209
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,440
apparatus

2210
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,000
and then also they're able to persist in

2211
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,960
a niche

2212
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,239
it doesn't mean that every language is

2213
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:18,239
going to be as successful in

2214
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,560
any niche but there is a place where

2215
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,480
it's successful so just like

2216
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,960
ants it's like that algorithms working

2217
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,840
there

2218
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,679
might be working somewhere else but it

2219
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:28,880
might not be

2220
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,440
so then we can look at this amazing

2221
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,440
diversity of language and communication

2222
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,960
structures including ones that don't

2223
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,360
even

2224
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,080
only use audio or ones that use audio

2225
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,440
dimensions that we're not

2226
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,800
you know using certain sounds or

2227
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,440
something but then also the syntactic

2228
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,679
and then like what is the invariance

2229
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,080
what is actually being communicated

2230
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,120
that's the structure of what is is being

2231
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:51,840
shared

2232
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,800
between agents that are like one another

2233
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,480
in certain dimensions

2234
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,960
and they're sharing state updates so

2235
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,239
that

2236
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,480
they can make it happen in their niche

2237
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,159
so it's like there's the total

2238
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,080
the diversity is because there's enough

2239
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,400
invariance for us to recognize it as

2240
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,320
part of the same category

2241
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,000
and then there's important things to

2242
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,360
look at in what it is that's

2243
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,839
in common

2244
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
yeah definitely um it's definitely like

2245
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,440
interesting to think about how

2246
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,880
the the communication shapes

2247
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,760
the structure shapes the all of that the

2248
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,199
structure of society and the structure

2249
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,400
of a human body

2250
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,040
uh scott

2251
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,679
you know it's so you guys are this is so

2252
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,719
fantastic i

2253
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,000
this is like everything

2254
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,639
comes together in these conversations so

2255
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:47,040
i was

2256
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,199
i was thinking what is this reminding me

2257
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,520
of i just read an article and i was like

2258
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,920
is it this does it remind me of this

2259
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,960
article which is about

2260
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,520
universal chemical synthesis computing

2261
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,719
no

2262
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,880
was it about this highly multiplex

2263
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,080
spatial mapping

2264
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,480
of microbial communities sort of but no

2265
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,920
what this reminds me of is this space

2266
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,600
time from bits

2267
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,520
this guy i just read this article it's

2268
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,880
about quantum gravity

2269
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,679
and what he asserts is gravity is what

2270
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,360
we perceive

2271
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,639
as it's actually entanglement of bits of

2272
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,480
information

2273
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,280
and so if you take out the entanglement

2274
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,440
you have no space time

2275
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,600
and what i'm thinking is the

2276
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,560
entanglements we just described

2277
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,440
that's everything we call it mind we

2278
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,159
call it society we call it eusociality

2279
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,400
we call it space-time

2280
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,280
it's edges and we're characterizing

2281
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,080
these edges

2282
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,560
and our affordances are so constrained

2283
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,400
that we try to describe it but we're

2284
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,600
describing it

2285
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,639
it's the shadows in the cave right we're

2286
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,520
seeing in

2287
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,159
just indirectly what's actually out

2288
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,840
there and one of the things that's

2289
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,239
enriching about this active inference

2290
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,840
notion

2291
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,560
is it provides us with a framing that's

2292
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,679
sufficiently

2293
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,199
generic but also sufficiently robust

2294
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,320
that it explains things in the stack and

2295
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,639
the time stack and the space stack

2296
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,560
it's kind of like wow this may be how

2297
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,239
things interact

2298
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:25,360
maybe things are entangled and

2299
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,199
we use the word internal model and

2300
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,679
external reality

2301
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,320
but maybe the nature of rhetoric and

2302
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,639
maybe the nature of entanglement

2303
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,400
is the seeking of connection

2304
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,840
by neg entropy systems so i you know

2305
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,280
my life definition is um that

2306
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,000
living systems are auto catalytic and

2307
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,199
entropy secreting

2308
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,520
my son said i just wanted to use the

2309
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,159
word secreting because it sounded gushy

2310
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,000
but if they're auto catalytic and

2311
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,600
entropy secreting then if you're a

2312
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,880
system that's living you're going to

2313
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,360
want to seek out other living systems

2314
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,719
because you need reproductive and

2315
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,880
nutritional opportunities

2316
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,800
in order to be auto catalytic and

2317
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
entropy secreting

2318
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,120
and you know it goes to the frog nervous

2319
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,880
system rules right if you if frog

2320
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,400
encounters something that's smaller than

2321
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,080
it and it moves it eats it if it's

2322
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,080
larger than it and it moves it runs away

2323
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,840
and if it's the same size as it and it

2324
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,679
moves it mates with it

2325
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,480
very simple rules that let a frog be a

2326
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,280
frog

2327
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,840
right so it feels like maybe what we're

2328
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,360
banging up against

2329
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,840
is too much too many words that we're

2330
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,560
throwing at

2331
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,679
simple concept and maybe we're talking

2332
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,800
about is harmonic

2333
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,360
coupling of living systems that are

2334
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,280
seeking other neg entropy states

2335
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,639
either to consume or mate with

2336
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,960
the last point i have a poster that i

2337
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,120
got from a guy in san francisco

2338
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,239
and it's in my shop and it says futurism

2339
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,480
imagining a fake future in the hope that

2340
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,320
the real future will come along and mate

2341
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,719
with it

2342
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,440
and that's kind of like what we're we do

2343
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,679
in active inference we're imagining

2344
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,560
our way into a we're perceiving an

2345
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,320
externality just because our perception

2346
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,840
say okay there's something you don't

2347
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,400
control

2348
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
out there and then we try to mate with

2349
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,920
it or eat it or run away from it

2350
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,320
i was reminded of the light cone slide

2351
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,080
here when we're talking about space and

2352
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,840
time and edges and

2353
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,400
um how that daniel included the slide

2354
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:28,960
how

2355
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,920
like light is is the boundary between

2356
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,120
space and time

2357
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,239
like that's kind of that trips me out um

2358
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,280
steven and then daniel

2359
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,480
yeah i think when we be interesting to

2360
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,520
also i think this

2361
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,800
opens up maybe a revisiting or with this

2362
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,400
with chris fields and some of this work

2363
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:48,800
about

2364
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,040
quantum contextuality as well because as

2365
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,400
you start to

2366
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,400
because one thing he did mention in his

2367
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,000
presentation you know

2368
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,440
there's this question about when it goes

2369
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,280
from being contextual which is

2370
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,199
or quantum like which is a highly

2371
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,040
constrained

2372
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,560
set of options basically

2373
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,920
once you've got more options for

2374
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,400
movement things start to move into

2375
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,880
more classical even if there's loads of

2376
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,239
quantum stuff going on at the small

2377
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,520
scale they all average out and

2378
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,960
effectively

2379
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,199
the gas in my room is behaving similar

2380
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,800
to the gases in all the rooms that we're

2381
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,679
in

2382
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,320
in a general generic sense only if we

2383
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,480
went into the sort of and and there's a

2384
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,239
question that comes up then around this

2385
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,600
sequence in

2386
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,120
um and um because

2387
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,440
where where is that sequencing possibly

2388
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,639
constrained enough

2389
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,400
that you might hit some things like that

2390
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,800
and is that part of what happens

2391
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,840
at these well you could call them

2392
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,480
meso levels i mean the cell the surface

2393
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,120
of a

2394
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,239
cell is small but it's not small from

2395
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:51,840
an atomic point of view it's still

2396
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,679
relatively aggregated

2397
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:56,239
yet we're getting these distinct flips

2398
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:57,040
in

2399
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,000
charge and is it plausible that anything

2400
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,320
as

2401
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,400
big as the brain can also do something

2402
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,520
like that

2403
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,600
and it may be that the term quantum is

2404
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,320
not necessary that in that sense but

2405
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,639
um yeah it'd be interesting to think

2406
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,000
about what it what what

2407
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,400
importance is there to be a constrained

2408
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,320
set of sequences a bit like daniel

2409
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,199
mentioned if

2410
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,960
a certain molecule is released and then

2411
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,320
another one's released and then another

2412
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,600
one's released

2413
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,760
that could be some sort of type of

2414
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,760
rhetorical dynamic but that

2415
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,600
there needs to be a constraint so that

2416
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,080
it's not just part of the

2417
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,239
classical noise you know it's not just

2418
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,840
swamped by

2419
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,760
a big flux of um randomness right that

2420
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,360
it actually is a sequence

2421
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,719
even if it's not as clear as you know

2422
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,480
so that might be an interesting question

2423
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,320
i don't know whether it's a fair

2424
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,280
question to put

2425
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,679
to mike if that's is or maybe it's more

2426
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,199
of a chris fields type question but i

2427
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,960
know they work together so

2428
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,159
they might have talked about some of

2429
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,320
this

2430
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,480
definitely daniel and then scott

2431
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,239
yep it was a key theme in this paper

2432
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,159
and in cybernetics in general that like

2433
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,440
goal seeking and

2434
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,400
planning as inference is a big area

2435
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,600
that's why we're always talking about

2436
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,120
like control theory

2437
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,080
and it is interesting to wonder how does

2438
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,320
the bioelectricity play a role in

2439
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,440
goal setting and then in basically

2440
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,520
policy selection because you know active

2441
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,960
inference we don't

2442
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,120
just specify which trajectory is going

2443
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,120
to be like the preferred one and then

2444
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,199
condense it down to a single summary

2445
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,560
statistic it's like

2446
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,639
there's the preferred states with the c

2447
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,159
and then the affordances with the e

2448
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,239
and then there's a equation that is

2449
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,360
selecting policies

2450
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,239
based upon you know a combination of

2451
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,760
different ways of phrasing some of the

2452
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,480
variables

2453
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,800
so then it's like how does that framing

2454
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,239
which is not just one way of

2455
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,960
going about doing what is it gonna allow

2456
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
us to say about

2457
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,560
like how systems actually plan

2458
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,639
i think that's kind of related to the

2459
01:27:58,639 --> 01:27:59,920
hint in figure 2

2460
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,120
on 32 like possible alien come

2461
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,000
ai it's saying that this framework

2462
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,679
wouldn't just help us describe

2463
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,040
systems but recognize systems that we

2464
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,000
didn't

2465
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,360
have ways of recognizing otherwise

2466
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,760
perhaps

2467
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,639
nice point and if um you know if another

2468
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:19,199
system

2469
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,360
was communicating with us how would we

2470
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,679
know right like what what would that

2471
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:28,239
even look like scott

2472
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:32,080
i was um have you guys seen this article

2473
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,199
decoding and perturbing decision states

2474
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:36,719
in real time now

2475
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,600
it's um p-e-i-x-o-t-o diogo

2476
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,159
pixoto it's it's about decision states

2477
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,600
it seems like it's very similar to what

2478
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,280
we're talking about here

2479
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,320
um 25th of march 2021 from nature

2480
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,000
magazine

2481
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,120
um and then bearheim v-e-r-h-e-i-n is

2482
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,239
another author

2483
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,880
um one of the things the reason the

2484
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,560
reason i was holding that up

2485
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,760
one of the things i was just writing

2486
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,719
down you know light cones

2487
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,000
lights um bosons right

2488
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,960
photons are bot or bosons and one of the

2489
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,480
things i always fuss with a little bit

2490
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,199
is

2491
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:14,960
okay is there a difference between

2492
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
fermionic and bosonic

2493
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,040
physics here that we need to attend to

2494
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,080
so the idea

2495
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,600
of fermions i always think of them as

2496
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,639
firm so they make up matter and bosons

2497
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,239
make up energy stuff

2498
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,080
and information is carried by bosons but

2499
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,760
also carried by embodiments in

2500
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,679
in fermions and stuff and so

2501
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:36,480
it's so interesting to me that how does

2502
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,120
the

2503
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,560
persuasion the rhetoric

2504
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,679
the the history

2505
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,840
get embodied both both sonically and

2506
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,239
fermionically again you have the peacock

2507
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,920
and you have the birds and the and the

2508
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,440
animals that develop certain

2509
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,040
physicalities over time as communication

2510
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,880
right it and it's a deep time

2511
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,480
communication and there's less

2512
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,440
discretion in it let's say they can

2513
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,520
exercise it or not but they have the

2514
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,239
embodi it's embodied in the physicality

2515
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,600
and then there's the

2516
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,040
action that they take which is

2517
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,880
again they have the physicality with

2518
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,239
which they act

2519
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,760
so what are the instruments given them

2520
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,600
physically but then they

2521
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,520
convey information by the behaviors they

2522
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,639
engage in and i keep coming back and

2523
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:25,120
thinking

2524
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,760
well it's kind of interesting if we look

2525
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,239
at the carrier signal

2526
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,080
again of information um

2527
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,440
is it in fact bosonic always it's

2528
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,280
things are carried by light i guess

2529
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,800
things carried by sound are being

2530
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,639
carried fermionically by the

2531
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,600
pressure in the sound wave i'm not sure

2532
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,400
but

2533
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,400
so maybe the medium i was just wondering

2534
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,920
whether the medium

2535
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,120
relates to the notion of rhetoric and if

2536
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,800
there's a pure

2537
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,280
form of information transfer when it's

2538
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,520
bosonic rather than fermionic and maybe

2539
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,239
that's getting

2540
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,800
way too reductionist on the thing but it

2541
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,760
i wondered whether

2542
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,080
light cones in their purest form which

2543
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,040
presumably are

2544
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,199
involved light right the original light

2545
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,719
traveling out and it can only go this

2546
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,800
way and you can't be beyond it

2547
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,520
and blue when you said before it was a

2548
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,880
statement

2549
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,360
that what is it outside the light cone

2550
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,199
there is no

2551
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,880
it's like the defines the edge of space

2552
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
time for the observer

2553
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,800
and so what's what's out there is an

2554
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,880
externality

2555
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,920
it feels like that boundary

2556
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,639
when that's known to other parties maybe

2557
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,320
in communication we're trying to do

2558
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,159
is think outside the light cone

2559
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,280
i don't know

2560
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,440
uh daniel and then stephen so the

2561
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,360
part of the light cone going forward in

2562
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,760
time is anticipation

2563
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,159
and if we take anticipation again not to

2564
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,920
be like a metaphysical claim about what

2565
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,199
systems are really doing

2566
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,280
but what the system is anticipating

2567
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,239
outwards

2568
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,960
that entails a generative model through

2569
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,360
time

2570
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,840
of the states that matter for this kind

2571
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,040
of an agent which is

2572
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,679
the internal state of the model itself

2573
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,360
the blanket states which are sense in

2574
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:13,840
action

2575
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,159
expected outcomes and expected actions

2576
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,600
and then the state of the niche the

2577
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,880
external states

2578
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,199
so kind of operationalizing the light

2579
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,040
cone as a specific

2580
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,159
prediction on specific variables

2581
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,400
might be helpful and kind of give a

2582
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,520
little bit more insight into how it

2583
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,560
could be used

2584
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,760
in a computer and then also just to

2585
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,280
scout your point about like the media's

2586
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,120
the message essentially

2587
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,600
it's like a multi-scale media is the

2588
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,719
message it's not just

2589
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,480
um bold print type versus cursive

2590
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,239
it's actually like you know you're

2591
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,719
bringing up types of subatomic particles

2592
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,800
like that media you know is ether the

2593
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,920
ultimate media

2594
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,400
like the nature of the media does matter

2595
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,120
and yeah

2596
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,199
it's a trade-off space like with

2597
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,239
peptides

2598
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,400
you have a larger signaling space than

2599
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,679
with small molecules like the

2600
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,679
combinatorics are just different

2601
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,320
but that entails totally new challenges

2602
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,679
like with specificity or

2603
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,320
cross-activation of neuropeptides or

2604
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,679
how do you keep them linked through

2605
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,000
evolutionary time and then we see sort

2606
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,239
of

2607
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,400
insights into those design trade-offs

2608
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,280
when we see like

2609
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,560
wow there are like a lot of

2610
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,480
neuropeptides that come from one

2611
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,440
precursor

2612
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,760
longer protein so that suggests that

2613
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,159
their co-regulation is held together

2614
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,480
through specific design principles so

2615
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,000
those are really interesting

2616
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,760
questions about how like the speed and

2617
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,760
the frequency and the bandwidth

2618
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,000
of different information channels

2619
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,280
structure

2620
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,320
how they end up performing

2621
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,360
nice stephen and then scott

2622
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,880
yeah i think daniel you're making a good

2623
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,800
point and it feeds on

2624
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,520
with um this question about time scales

2625
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,320
and

2626
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,199
is if we i assume that slides up the one

2627
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,560
that's there with the tick and the dog

2628
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:56,960
and

2629
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,000
human and possible alien um and

2630
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,520
so the cones there yes it's very useful

2631
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,960
to think of it

2632
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,280
in terms of i've got my maximum

2633
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,360
information now maybe my maximum

2634
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,040
information was even a little bit in the

2635
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,480
past

2636
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,560
but it depends on what regime of

2637
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,480
attention i was applying right i

2638
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,679
i made choices so as i make choices into

2639
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:20,320
the present

2640
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:24,400
i reduce the possible cone

2641
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,440
extent i've got available you know um

2642
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,159
and

2643
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,080
as i bring things only into my conscious

2644
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,199
awareness you know um

2645
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,880
certain things are going to be left out

2646
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,639
and then bringing that

2647
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:39,440
into okay this is a particular type of

2648
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,040
future i might predict

2649
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,600
based on my regime of attention is

2650
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,840
actually probably

2651
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,239
more useful in some ways

2652
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,400
to this because the cone going out it's

2653
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,560
a nice idea but it can lead to thinking

2654
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,320
that we know more and more in the future

2655
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
there's more more futures out there

2656
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,280
which is there is more more futures but

2657
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,400
not necessarily coming out from us

2658
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,320
um so it could be this is a bit more

2659
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,719
like okay my cone could move around a

2660
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:07,760
lot

2661
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,159
and there is actually a lot of analogy

2662
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,600
with that because now a lot of

2663
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,360
futures work they're actually saying

2664
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,280
you're better off picking a scenario in

2665
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,960
the future

2666
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,520
building out the scenario in the future

2667
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,119
as a separate thing

2668
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,199
not inheriting your present because that

2669
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,880
will always bias you

2670
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,960
and then bring it back bring your

2671
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,000
present which is what you

2672
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,320
know and your assumptions here and sort

2673
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,920
of bridging the two

2674
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,520
in terms of the narrative rather than

2675
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,360
this idea of i can

2676
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,280
go because i'm could just be going with

2677
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,480
all my

2678
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,119
assumptions and all my pre-assumptions

2679
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:42,320
from the present

2680
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,920
and making all these stories about the

2681
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,679
future um

2682
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,920
and um and starting it almost starts

2683
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,760
from a singularity in those other

2684
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,040
diagrams it's like goes from a

2685
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,800
singularity and opens up whereas

2686
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,239
actually really

2687
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:59,440
the widest is now potentially this is

2688
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,040
the most information i have potentially

2689
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,920
available

2690
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,800
or at least within the 10 or 20 seconds

2691
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,080
of this moment

2692
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,760
um so i think that actually

2693
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,119
there's other ways that this could

2694
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,600
change the way people think about

2695
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,440
sense making in time and space

2696
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:23,520
really super nice point stephen um scott

2697
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,880
wow stephen wow i mean that's so

2698
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,040
awesome when it makes me think okay

2699
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,199
first of all

2700
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:34,320
encoding and decoding okay so something

2701
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,760
i i just wrote down mutations

2702
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:43,360
encode new speculative space time

2703
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,600
so mutation gives you access it's a

2704
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,280
random mutation

2705
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,440
that gives you access to space time you

2706
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,760
weren't intending to access

2707
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,679
and the same thing with externalities if

2708
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,239
another thing comes in then this is jazz

2709
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,920
this is jazz genetics right is you get

2710
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,920
mutations and it's like whoa i didn't

2711
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,040
want to access that

2712
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,360
that new like cone area but i guess i'm

2713
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,400
there now

2714
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,960
okay let's see what we got here and

2715
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,239
that's pretty awesome

2716
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,239
because otherwise you'd be settled in

2717
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,920
your ways and you'd never see that space

2718
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,440
that this flight cone area would never

2719
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,320
open up

2720
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,360
and you don't know what it's going to be

2721
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,360
you don't know it's like it's

2722
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,119
i always said to my kids life is a

2723
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,440
one-act play no rehearsals

2724
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,760
that's a light cone right you just go

2725
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,679
through and it's like okay here we go

2726
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,960
so that idea of encoding

2727
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,560
and decoding is kind of interesting so

2728
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,000
you have this the

2729
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,520
we we go out there in the world and

2730
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,280
we're like okay i want to interpret the

2731
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,840
world

2732
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,600
now some things were encoded with

2733
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,000
intention to communicate

2734
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,040
music speech some things were encoded

2735
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,600
with intention to observate right

2736
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,280
cryptography stuff whatever

2737
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,639
some things were encoded with no

2738
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,320
intention to communicate but they do

2739
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,679
communicate like

2740
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,239
oh leaves are green so therefore over

2741
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,520
time we figure out that they have

2742
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,679
magnesium in the photosynthetic cycle or

2743
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,119
whatever right so they're not

2744
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,040
the color is encoded in the thing but

2745
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,800
the tree is not intending to say i'm

2746
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,719
doing photosynthesis right it's just

2747
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:10,639
we now take that perception

2748
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:13,520
and can decode something that was never

2749
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,800
encoded with

2750
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,440
discretion i guess or intention by the

2751
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,119
organism or whatever you know we don't

2752
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,080
run going with that

2753
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,520
so this notion of these light cones

2754
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,760
and it from the perceiver's perspective

2755
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,040
we can decode within a light cone we can

2756
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,840
decide an

2757
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,560
artist decodes a light cone and somebody

2758
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,239
else seeing the same perceptions would

2759
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,400
not have the same light cone

2760
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,960
right somebody with different priors can

2761
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,880
see things a person who knows history

2762
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,320
will not repeat it because they're like

2763
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,080
they see the same history now and they

2764
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,719
go

2765
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,560
whoa whoa whoa whoa that looks like an

2766
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,760
insurrection

2767
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,600
like their light cone is more trained to

2768
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,600
the possibility that's an insurrection

2769
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,960
so this last couple of comments are

2770
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,000
fascinating to me

2771
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,040
that we're moving through space we have

2772
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,719
this active inference model

2773
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,560
we're running a model there's myriad

2774
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,719
other models and non-models out there

2775
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,040
that we're seeking to decode

2776
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,840
some subset of them were intended to be

2777
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,679
coding information

2778
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:16,239
some subset or not and we're just moving

2779
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,320
through space decoding everything

2780
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,159
some of it will be false signal some of

2781
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:21,520
the actual signal

2782
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,639
and so the light cones the experience we

2783
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:25,119
have

2784
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,560
obviously can never be replicated by

2785
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,480
another person with different priors

2786
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,600
but also in real time

2787
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,520
it's a i don't know what the equivalent

2788
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,679
is of a cacophony of light cones

2789
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,760
a babble of light cones or it's like

2790
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,960
that ice cream cone again there's too

2791
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,920
much ice cream maybe in the cone

2792
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,639
anyway it's fascinating notion of that

2793
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:45,040
over

2794
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,880
decoding in a way and what and maybe the

2795
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,159
scientific method

2796
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:53,360
has something to do with a rigor on the

2797
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,440
over decoding that can happen with

2798
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,799
alchemy or something like that

2799
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:04,239
nice point daniel and then stephen

2800
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:07,040
so to scott's point about the mutation

2801
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,080
as uh

2802
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,360
accessing spatial temporal uh

2803
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,560
zones like expanding uh into space-time

2804
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,159
i thought okay maybe there's some like

2805
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,080
quantum you know 4d

2806
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,719
three plus one interpretation of that

2807
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:21,280
but

2808
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,040
how can we think about that with the

2809
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,639
information that we already empirically

2810
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:25,280
know

2811
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,280
and it's actually that mutations in

2812
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,880
developmental biology

2813
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,360
developmental genetics facilitate the

2814
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,239
exploration

2815
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:35,440
of new developmental space and time like

2816
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,360
by slowing down or speeding up the way

2817
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,560
that a certain cell type

2818
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,040
is uh susceptible to a hormone or

2819
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,159
something like that

2820
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:44,159
so what's being played with is actually

2821
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,080
the level faster

2822
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,040
because that's why there's the

2823
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,719
intergenerational transmission of those

2824
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:49,440
mutations

2825
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,239
but then what they're actually modifying

2826
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:54,000
like the source code but

2827
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,119
not exactly in that way of course is how

2828
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,760
the system bootstraps and modifies

2829
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,760
itself through development and learning

2830
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,760
and then how can we think about active

2831
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,960
inference in that way

2832
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,280
well we can think about the mutations as

2833
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,679
modifying like the initial parameters or

2834
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:10,400
some of the

2835
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,520
state variables for the parameters that

2836
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,199
are important for an active inference

2837
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,000
agent like

2838
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,760
the structure of its internal generative

2839
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,760
model its blanket states like its

2840
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,000
sensory and action affordances and then

2841
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,119
the niche

2842
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,960
so that's a way where we can have the

2843
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,800
generality to talk about like

2844
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,400
potentially a system across different

2845
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,199
scales

2846
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,119
but then when we're ready to actually

2847
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,119
formalize it and then

2848
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,880
ask how to design communication in that

2849
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,199
niche

2850
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,119
nice point stephen

2851
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,600
yeah that's a good point thinking about

2852
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,440
those different time scales and

2853
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,400
and sort of following on from that

2854
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,119
you've got

2855
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:52,159
this question of

2856
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,800
the um so maybe the things are happening

2857
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,360
at this

2858
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,760
light speed and there's a lot of

2859
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,960
electrical activity

2860
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,199
happening in these cells and groups of

2861
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,119
cells and

2862
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,199
and we've got these structures that we

2863
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:06,800
can come together and of course

2864
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,920
we then have this intermodal

2865
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,320
integration between different cells

2866
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,719
nerves coming in and the question then

2867
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,880
also is

2868
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,679
as it's coming in say from my body to my

2869
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:20,480
brain

2870
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,679
and my feet are seeing the world

2871
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,880
in the past cons compared to my nose

2872
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,560
right because it takes longer for the

2873
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,800
sort of information to travel up from my

2874
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,000
foot

2875
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,600
the signals at the speed of light

2876
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,840
traveling but by the time it does that

2877
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,960
through all the chemical

2878
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,400
interactions it you know it's

2879
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,159
milliseconds not

2880
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,560
billionths of a second so it's coming

2881
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,600
together

2882
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,400
in this structure of the body which is

2883
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,360
grown

2884
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,600
to you know to integrate it but at some

2885
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,920
point the system has to calibrate

2886
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,880
it has to calibrate so that it doesn't

2887
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,639
think that my foot is in a different

2888
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:57,840
time to my

2889
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,520
nose or my ears or my fingers right

2890
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,920
so that sort of brings that question of

2891
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:04,800
of

2892
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,480
um you know some of this multi-scale

2893
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,040
stuff

2894
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,719
will come out of these kind of

2895
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,560
electrical

2896
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,800
light speed dynamics but then it's going

2897
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,760
to also

2898
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,560
come into the uh the structures i think

2899
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,760
the daniel was talking about structures

2900
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,040
we all sort of mentioned structures and

2901
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:21,760
then

2902
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,520
there's going to be a system that sort

2903
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,360
of at times

2904
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,080
has to sort of tweak it you know and

2905
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,760
maybe that system's not needed when

2906
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,360
you've got a small set of cells that are

2907
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,119
all firing electrically and

2908
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:34,800
doing other chemical signals they just

2909
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
the structure's enough in a way

2910
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,360
but uh um so yeah i thought that that

2911
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,080
might be kind of

2912
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,760
that might be an interesting question to

2913
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,840
ask michael as well if this

2914
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,239
you know how does how does that kind of

2915
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:49,199
play out with this

2916
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,000
nice daniel and then scott yeah just a

2917
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,480
quick comment on that so the signal

2918
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,360
processing

2919
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,440
or the sort of outside in perspective

2920
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,800
would suggest that there would have to

2921
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,480
be like a recalibration

2922
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,400
then the generative model out way of

2923
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,320
thinking is that the generative model

2924
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,239
is that like your hands clap and the

2925
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:09,600
sound and the visual

2926
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,080
are the same event so there isn't as

2927
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,520
much of a calibration of

2928
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,960
inputs as there is a reconciliation

2929
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,320
of deep temporal models which are timed

2930
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,199
based upon

2931
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:22,960
the inferred causal structure of the

2932
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,560
world which is usually not two separate

2933
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,600
events

2934
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,480
but rather one and then that is actually

2935
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:28,960
just

2936
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,360
embodied in the sensory relay which does

2937
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,960
take different amounts of time

2938
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,800
to transfer from different parts of the

2939
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,119
body

2940
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,239
nice scott yeah okay so i just was just

2941
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:41,840
one thing on that i'm just before scott

2942
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,600
that's a good point i think

2943
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,880
that's interesting you know thinking

2944
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,639
about predictive processing

2945
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,400
and not getting caught up in the in

2946
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,760
that's where it's tricky because it's

2947
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,760
it's not directly an input it's a kind

2948
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,480
of

2949
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,600
error message so yeah that's cool that's

2950
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,199
not the part that's experienced

2951
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:01,280
yeah and the parsing of that opens up

2952
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:04,239
awareness right if you can parse the

2953
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:04,800
different

2954
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,920
pieces and start to break it down this

2955
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,280
last couple of pieces i

2956
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,880
thought you know the occupy movement

2957
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,480
occupy wall street

2958
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,400
it feels like active inference we should

2959
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,559
have t-shirts made up occupy light cone

2960
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,400
because everyone's every organism is

2961
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,080
trying to occupy everyone else's light

2962
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,040
cone

2963
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,760
i think i mean and when i so we worked

2964
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,679
for microsoft for

2965
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,280
at the law school we had a program

2966
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,199
microsoft paid

2967
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,880
professors intellectual property

2968
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,560
professors to go to china

2969
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,000
to teach intellectual property

2970
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,719
professors in china and in india

2971
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,840
usip law concepts

2972
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,000
now why why was microsoft doing that

2973
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,199
they were doing that because they were

2974
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,080
trying to render

2975
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,320
the externality innocuous there was a

2976
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,159
piracy externality

2977
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,159
that they were dealing with and so they

2978
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:53,280
thought if they teach

2979
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,560
the teachers in those jurisdictions

2980
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,440
about the value of intellectual property

2981
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,239
and then teach the lawyers at the law

2982
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:02,800
schools

2983
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,320
the teachers teach the lawyers those

2984
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,119
notions then the microsoft notions of

2985
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,320
intellectual property

2986
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,080
they'll be left software privacy so that

2987
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,679
was they weren't doing it for

2988
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,280
beneficence they were doing it to render

2989
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,800
the externality innocuous

2990
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,400
they were trying to occupy the light

2991
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,638
cone

2992
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,920
of a bit of a culture right with this

2993
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,719
affordance

2994
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,960
uh shifting by mutating the

2995
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,600
teachers views and the way they taught

2996
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,679
intellectual property law

2997
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,679
so that that to me

2998
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:39,199
there's a i once heard a quote that

2999
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:42,239
trees were bullies because trees suck up

3000
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,440
the water and the light

3001
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,600
in an area right you know they bully

3002
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,880
other plants and i always thought you

3003
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,159
know trees are so nice and i always

3004
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,080
think of trees as bullies now

3005
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,760
and it's kind of interesting when some

3006
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,520
when an organism

3007
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,199
is applying rhetoric or other vehicles

3008
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:00,400
to sweep in and

3009
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,840
you know like pigeons when they do

3010
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,679
pigeon racing when you try to pigeons

3011
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:04,159
try to

3012
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:05,679
flock and you try to grab everyone

3013
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:07,199
else's pigeons right

3014
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,960
or i don't know in hive behaviors if

3015
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,800
hives pick up other bees

3016
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,360
and that makes them fitter as hives or

3017
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,040
if there's mixing of bees when they do

3018
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,719
swarming i don't know the answer to that

3019
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:17,760
i just don't know enough about bee

3020
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:18,800
biology

3021
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,679
but it is kind of interesting that light

3022
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:22,560
cones

3023
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,280
maybe are pretty darn aggressive for

3024
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,080
living things

3025
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,400
trying to render externalities innocuous

3026
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,440
and maybe that goes to gaia theory

3027
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,600
that ultimately what what's the light

3028
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,560
cone for gaia

3029
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,159
yeah the biggest light cone of them all

3030
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,920
just what you were saying made me think

3031
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,600
of maybe

3032
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,679
you know we think about it as a light

3033
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:52,080
cone but maybe what we're looking at is

3034
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,960
like an information cone you know and so

3035
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:55,920
like

3036
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,679
like a concentration of information

3037
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,920
within an individual because in the end

3038
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:00,639
we dissipate

3039
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,000
you know there's no more information

3040
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,360
concentrated there uh stephen

3041
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,440
yeah and it might be a question when we

3042
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,760
think about this term light cone

3043
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:13,280
and i was walking home last night and

3044
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,119
i could see the clouds and i could see

3045
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,880
the lightning

3046
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,560
but i could only hear the thunder you

3047
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,920
know five seconds late or whatever so

3048
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,159
the information cone on the audio was

3049
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:25,760
different to the information

3050
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,000
if it is an information cone and then i

3051
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,920
don't know the smell of the

3052
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,920
the rain or the change of that so um

3053
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,400
i might be interested in how much the

3054
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:36,960
the

3055
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,639
there may be some elements in certain

3056
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,480
scales where really it's light

3057
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,239
it's about the speed of light i mean

3058
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,000
near enough so that's what it is or

3059
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,800
maybe it's a broader category which

3060
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,440
could roll

3061
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,639
out into these other spatial temporal

3062
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,520
modalities

3063
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,639
yeah the uh so i mean you know when

3064
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:00,719
you're in a space if you wake up in a

3065
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,560
dark room what's the first thing you do

3066
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,920
like where am i right turn on the light

3067
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,960
that's a very human um way to maximize

3068
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,560
your information gain

3069
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,320
i mean not every organism obviously can

3070
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,760
see like uh daniel

3071
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,320
i think my closing thought on this would

3072
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,199
just be that

3073
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,440
it really speaks steven's story about

3074
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,960
how there actually was a temporal

3075
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,800
structuring even though you cognitively

3076
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,239
knew it was a single event

3077
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,520
you actually classified it into a

3078
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,960
separate kind of event which is like the

3079
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,880
exception that proves the rule

3080
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,119
that suggested long long ago that the

3081
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,400
speed of sound and light were

3082
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,199
different how are we going to make sense

3083
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,280
of this total continuum of

3084
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:42,159
signaling in the niche we can think

3085
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,080
about ostensive cues and helping you

3086
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:44,800
plan

3087
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,840
there's something when you smell

3088
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,960
something and you have eight hours to

3089
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,719
plan for the storm versus you know you

3090
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:49,760
hear the lightning strike you have a

3091
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,199
half second to plan

3092
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:53,119
et cetera so we can think about the

3093
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,520
structuring of different kinds of cues

3094
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,639
in the niche as giving information that

3095
01:49:58,639 --> 01:49:59,280
is

3096
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,159
in light of a generative model able to

3097
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,560
be used for anticipation in action

3098
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,920
so that's just speaking to how

3099
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,599
core active inferences to thinking about

3100
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:10,960
these different processes coming

3101
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,760
together

3102
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,080
and that's why it'll be awesome to get

3103
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,199
the author's perspective

3104
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,040
on all of this and what active inference

3105
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,440
is going to do

3106
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,920
nice scott you have a final thought for

3107
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,639
us

3108
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,880
yeah just again that i'm still intrigued

3109
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,560
by the notion of the entanglement

3110
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,159
creating space time and this whole

3111
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,599
discussion of

3112
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,639
time cones and the time cones in the

3113
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:34,320
relation of space-time

3114
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,840
relativity theory etc and uh i feel like

3115
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,320
this

3116
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:41,440
one thing that active inference has done

3117
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,760
whatever it's and there's so it's

3118
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,040
powerful in many ways

3119
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,080
one thing it's done is allowed me to

3120
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,639
open up my mind to processes

3121
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:54,480
that feel like they're replicated

3122
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,520
across time and scales

3123
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,080
and that's interesting because whether

3124
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,920
or not they're strictly

3125
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,400
fall within active inference math and

3126
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,520
rigor

3127
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,040
the the model has

3128
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,679
uh opened up so many different ways of

3129
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,040
thinking about things

3130
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,599
and the entanglement notion where we

3131
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,480
think of two

3132
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,800
is it two particles or one spooky action

3133
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,480
at a distance

3134
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,159
it feels like everything else we're

3135
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,760
talking about active inference is spooky

3136
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,199
action at a distance for me

3137
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:26,719
it's just that it's a different spooky

3138
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,280
action at a distance and so

3139
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,760
it's fascinating the notion of

3140
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,679
entanglements and it feels like light

3141
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:34,560
cones

3142
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,960
may be describing the things that are

3143
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,159
amenable to in

3144
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:41,760
be entangled or coupled and so maybe

3145
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,480
if it's an information cone that's an

3146
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,119
interesting

3147
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,560
notion that we can start to say

3148
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,639
communities expand out

3149
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,719
that which is amenable to coupling

3150
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,400
because they widen

3151
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:55,760
the light cones so that using that

3152
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,719
rhetoric

3153
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,719
may start to be a way that we can

3154
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,840
illustrate the benefits

3155
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,920
of community-based behaviors

3156
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,000
and things like that so we can start to

3157
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,920
bring this back and say look

3158
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:09,679
you can't see around the corner but that

3159
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:11,360
person who's up there they're standing

3160
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:12,639
there and they can see around the corner

3161
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:13,840
and if they can talk to you they can

3162
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,520
tell you what's around the corner

3163
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,639
so maybe that's good right and so maybe

3164
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:20,320
that's contact tracing for

3165
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,880
pandemics maybe that's you know giving

3166
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,639
the neighborhood watch for

3167
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,880
other toxic things in the neighborhood

3168
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,000
environment whatever

3169
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,679
so it feels like this gets simple enough

3170
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:32,880
you know people may not want to know

3171
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,960
about light cones or whatever but they

3172
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,760
it starts to get the entanglement and

3173
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,960
that notion of

3174
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,000
cause and effect feels like there's a

3175
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,159
story that we can tell here

3176
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:47,440
and illustrate pretty simply

3177
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,679
anyway it's exciting it's an exciting

3178
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:51,360
conversation some wonderful stuff and

3179
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,639
it's delightful to be back in the

3180
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,239
conversation

3181
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:57,760
so just uh to come to the author's like

3182
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,880
final point

3183
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,639
in this um you know the dissolution

3184
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:04,800
of the self right this is like the the

3185
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,000
practice of of

3186
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,639
zen um he says it is striking that the

3187
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:09,360
process which

3188
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,119
zen practice is meant to reverse

3189
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:12,800
attachment to past memories and high

3190
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,440
valence for future expectations or fears

3191
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,679
is precisely the process suggested to be

3192
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,599
responsible for the creation of complex

3193
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:20,400
selves

3194
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,599
so i want to know what happens to the

3195
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:24,639
informational

3196
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,960
light cone in this like dissolution of

3197
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,199
the self does it like you know turn into

3198
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:31,280
lots of little light cones as is kind of

3199
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,880
implied in like the

3200
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,280
the one figure but or does it just like

3201
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,119
poof and like dissipate i don't know

3202
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,880
it's it's interesting to think about

3203
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,520
um that for me he says it's unclear

3204
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,760
whether it's beneficial or even possible

3205
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,520
to truly live in the moment and let go

3206
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,840
of past memories and future expectations

3207
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,599
but anyone who succeeded in doing this

3208
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:51,119
would achieve precisely what zen

3209
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:51,920
promises

3210
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,360
the dissolution of the self um so thanks

3211

3212
