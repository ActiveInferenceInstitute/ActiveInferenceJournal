00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,000
hello everyone welcome to actin flab

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,160
live stream number 25.2

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
today is july 13th 2021 and we're going

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
to be talking about this paper

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
the computational boundary of a self

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
developmental bioelectricity

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
drives multicellularity and skill free

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
cognition

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
we are here with the author mike levin

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
we are a participatory online lab

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
that is communicating learning and

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
practicing applied active inference

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
you can find us at the links here on

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
this page this is a recorded and an

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,280
archived live stream

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
so please provide us with feedback so

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,879
that we can improve our work

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
welcome here and we will be following

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
good idiot video etiquette for live

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,039
streams

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,399
here at the short link you'll find all

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,559
the live streams that we've done so far

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
and we're going to have a new series of

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,680
live streams coming up

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,960
in the next semester

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
so we're going to be jumping off here

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
with the author

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,600
uh discussing this paper and we will

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
just do a brief round of introductions i

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
am blue knight and i am an independent

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
research consultant

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,839
based out of new mexico

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
uh yeah my name is sarah davis i'm a

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
master's philosophy student at this

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,119
point um past engineer and science

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,720
artist just generally interested

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
in how the world works michael

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,280
yeah i'm mike levin i'm a professor in

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
the biology department at tufts

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,680
university

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
i run the allen discovery center at

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,799
tufts and i'm also

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
a associate faculty at the peace

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
institute at harvard

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,360
cool so sarah what is something that

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,240
you're excited

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,079
to talk about today or something that

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,759
you'd like to remember about

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,880
the paper maybe want to give a heads up

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
um the most interesting kind of through

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,240
line for me

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
in in all of michael's work that i've

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,280
looked at is this

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,560
um connection or this um maybe tension

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
i don't know the way the the morphology

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,119
plays with electricity just um

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
yeah which one's in the driver's seat or

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
some kind of like understanding of

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
how those two work together

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
awesome is there any like burning

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
questions that you have that you want to

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,040
start off with

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
or otherwise i can just start oh no i

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,200
feel like that

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
is going to kind of happen down the road

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
that particular focus so

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
please yeah okay so here we are on the

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
paper we're going to be discussing today

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
how do multiple nested scales of

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
individuality

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
work yeah um

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
so i i want to preface this by saying

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
that and maybe maybe this is obvious but

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
i just want to say that

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
all of this is very much a work in

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
progress so i'm going to tell you what i

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
think about these things but

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
uh i certainly am not claiming that this

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
is all worked out or that i'm not going

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
to change my mind at some point

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
or uh you know that that this is not

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
going to develop in some

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
fashion this is under under um you know

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,239
constant constant work

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,760
so i think the

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,400
fundamentals of all this are simply that

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
there are multiple interpenetrating

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
systems at different scales that are all

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
present simultaneously

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
all of which can be profitably looked at

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,800
as

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
uh as as individuals and so this diagram

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,640
here

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
sort of it it looks like all it's saying

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
is the the mere

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
sort of fact of um physical structure if

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
you look you see organisms and within

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
that you've got organs and cells so

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
so that's not the you know that's sort

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
of not the whole point of this the point

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
isn't merely that they're arranged this

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,920
way

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
but that you've got some units and those

105
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
subunits have themselves subunits all of

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,200
which are

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
cells and what i mean by them being

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
cells is the central

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
claim of the paper is that they are to

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,239
some extent

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
so so not not binary but on a continuum

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
of agency they are to some extent goal

113
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,640
uh directed uh agents so they're trying

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
to achieve certain themes

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
and so when i say that they're nested

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
all of this simply means that you can

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,959
have systems

118
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
where the different parts are all

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,560
actively trying to achieve

120
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
various things in their own spaces and

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
we should talk about that that's an

122
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,320
important

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
part that developed since this paper was

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
written is this idea of different action

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
spaces that these things are working in

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
um but but they're nested in the sense

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
that i think

128
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
just because a higher level system

129
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
acquires a goal or is pursuing a goal

130
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
that doesn't mean the lower systems

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
aren't doing it and

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
uh all of these things are in fact

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
simultaneously doing their best to

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,320
pursue various kinds of goals

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
so that's what i meant by multiple

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,360
nested

137
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
individuals awesome

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
so is there a total 100 of individuality

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,919
that gets

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,000
partitioned and something that i've been

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
really interested in

142
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
is how is information passed forward and

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
backward across levels like is there

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
some kind of core screening

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
or um like salience

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,680
like dominates the information to pass

147
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,199
forward so how does that

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,240
kind of information flow work

149
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
yeah so so the scaling and the

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
relationship between layers is of course

151
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
one of the most interesting things here

152
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
so one of the things we are currently

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
trying to do

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
both experimentally and with modeling is

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,800
to really show

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
some very tight examples because this

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
paper is largely qualitative

158
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
but we're now trying to show some very

159
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,440
specific examples

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
where you where we can we can actually

161
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
track the scaling so so you have lower

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
level subunits so let's say you have

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,919
cells

164
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
that have only local metabolical so all

165
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
they know how to do is pursue some some

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
energy level in a kind of homeostasis to

167
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,919
stay alive

168
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,280
and so the question is how do you

169
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
connect those in a way

170
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
that is then going to give rise to a

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
larger agent that has much larger scale

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,320
goals that can be

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
uh working towards a a state of affairs

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,840
and

175
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
and to be actually stressed by the

176
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
failure to reach a state of affairs

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,759
that is way bigger than any individual

178
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,960
cell and so

179
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
i'm not sure that there's any kind of

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
conservation here in the sense that

181
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
there's only a total amount that you

182
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
sort of have to partition it among the

183
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
levels and

184
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
and that's all that there is i'm i'm not

185
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
sure that's yeah i would i would make

186
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,400
that claim i think that

187
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
um the total amount of individuality can

188
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
change over time and it can rise and

189
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
fall and in fact the boundaries between

190
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,039
the different

191
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
agents can can grow and shrink that's a

192
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
that was a significant part of the paper

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
to talk about that

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,600
um and what there's a couple of there's

195
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
a couple of interesting things that get

196
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
passed upwards so to speak um definitely

197
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
a kind of force graining in the sense

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,880
that

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
if you are a system whose parts are

200
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
themselves competent in getting various

201
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
things done despite changing conditions

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
and and so on they're not just the

203
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
hard-wired mechanisms but actually

204
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
competent to pursue specific outcomes

205
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
despite perturbations

206
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
what it means is that the larger system

207
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,720
is now

208
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,199
working in a much easier space in the

209
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,919
sense that

210
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
it's if it doesn't have to micromanage

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
all the micro states

212
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
that that the individual pieces are

213
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
doing but it can rely on those

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
components to get there to get their job

215
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
done then what you're really

216
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
working in is a much is a much lower

217
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
dimensional simpler space

218
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
where problem solving gets easier and

219
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
just as a simple biological example

220
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
you know we now know that uh for example

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,160
in the in the tadpole if you uh

222
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,360
if you activate uh a signal that

223
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
triggers it happens to be a bioelectric

224
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,479
signal that that triggers

225
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
eye formation in another part of the

226
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,919
embryo let's say on the tail

227
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,639
then all kinds of interesting things

228
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,919
will happen

229
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,599
it will it will build an eye it will

230
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,440
recruit cells that you never directly

231
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
manipulated so it's a local

232
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,479
self-organization process

233
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
that eye will form even though it's

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,280
sitting in the middle of muscle instead

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
of

236
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
in the brain where it where it belongs

237
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,479
all these things are going to happen

238
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,120
anyway

239
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
if you're if you're at the larger and by

240
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
the way those tackles can then see out

241
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
of that eye even though it's on the tail

242
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,879
instead of

243
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
in the head so if you are a system that

244
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,199
um needs to solve some problems in terms

245
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,440
of

246
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
uh i've got some eyes and i need to do

247
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
this behavior that i'm doing and so on

248
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
if you don't have to micromanage all of

249
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
those components

250
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
and saying each cell of that eye where

251
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
exactly it's going to go what exactly

252
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,319
it's going to attach to and so on

253
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
if if there is an effector that you have

254
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
access to an affordance

255
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
maybe that says build an eye and you as

256
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
a larger system don't need to know how

257
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
that's going to happen you can just

258
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
trust that that is going to happen under

259
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
a wide range of conditions you have a

260
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
much simpler

261
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
space to work in and the problem solving

262
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
that's one of the things we're doing now

263
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
is trying to map out some of the

264
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,799
different

265
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,159
spaces in which all these different

266
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,480
agents are actually solving problems

267
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
and trying to define what that what that

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
means uh

269
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
so one of the things that that gets that

270
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
gets passed up is this is is this uh

271
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
coarse graining because of the lower

272
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
level competency so that that's

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
i think a key thing and maybe we'll get

274
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
to talking about what that does for

275
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
evolution because i think it's massively

276
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
important

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
nice sarah i don't have a unfortunately

278
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
they've moved to change the interface so

279
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
i don't know where the hand is anymore

280
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,440
in this but

281
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
um one question that keeps coming up for

282
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
me in in all the different

283
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
um realms of discussion about this is

284
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
like well in particular with the

285
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
bioelectricity part you know you you use

286
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
the word

287
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,040
um subroutines when you were talking

288
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
about you know we we think we're

289
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,839
starting to understand the

290
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,880
the the whatever combinatorics of of how

291
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
this works and

292
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
and and also related to these nested

293
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
levels and things like this

294
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
i i just keep wondering if it's your

295
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,000
sense

296
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
from all of this work that you've done

297
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
that in nature

298
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
in in in the communication between these

299
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
levels

300
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
that there's any amount of abstraction

301
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,959
or semantic layer that's needed um

302
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
for for that to happen uh between

303
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
uh levels you know and also with the

304
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
electricity like subroutine implies that

305
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
there's some kind of semantics

306
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
um that something has to rest on and i

307
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
that just keeps coming back to me do you

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
have any sense about that

309
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
yeah so so a couple of things so one

310
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,959
thing about bioelectricity

311
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
is that um bioelectricity i

312
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
i think is interesting not because it's

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
in some sense uh you know magical or

314
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
there's some there's

315
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
something you know sort of uniquely

316
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,120
better about bioelectricity than

317
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
biomechanical or biochemical um modes

318
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,399
of interaction what i think is really

319
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,640
interesting about bioelectricity is that

320
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
that is what is being used and perhaps

321
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
these other modes too

322
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
are too we don't know but but

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
bioelectricity for sure

324
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
is uh being used as the

325
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
computational medium by which the lower

326
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
levels um bind together into the higher

327
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
level cognition

328
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
so so about the higher systems cognition

329
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,839
whatever

330
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,600
level it may have so what the

331
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
bioelectricity allows us to do is to

332
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
directly peek

333
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
into that computation and so i think

334
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,399
that's why it's interesting

335
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
um which is no surprise that's exactly

336
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,760
when people do neural decoding that's

337
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
exactly what they hope right is that by

338
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
tracking the bioelectricity

339
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
they learn something about the

340
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
information content of the global system

341
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,959
right what is the

342
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
the animal or the or the human thinking

343
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
about so it's exactly the same here so

344
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
that that's what's unique about

345
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,519
bioelectricity and i think that

346
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,240
uh what evolution discovered very early

347
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,959
on

348
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
is that and and and then it capitalized

349
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
on that by pivoting it into

350
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,640
into neural kinds of systems and we do

351
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
it in our computational devices and so

352
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
on

353
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
is that what evolution found really

354
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,720
really early

355
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,880
is around the time of bacterial biofilms

356
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
actually is that

357
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
electricity is a great way to process

358
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
information to integrate information

359
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
across distance

360
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
and to do computations right now that

361
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
shouldn't be a surprise to anybody

362
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
so um i don't know if i would claim that

363
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,360
it has

364
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
uh you know any kind of a formal syntax

365
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
at these levels or anything like that

366
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,440
but what it definitely does do is a kind

367
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,760
of

368
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
when i say subroutine what i'm mostly

369
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
leaning on is

370
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
this idea of modularity but not just

371
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
modularity in form because that's been

372
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,040
discussed a lot in evolutionary

373
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,639
developmental biology but

374
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,279
actually modularity of function so so

375
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,200
the key the the thing the thing about a

376
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
good subroutine

377
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
is that you're going to when you

378
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
activate the subroutine

379
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
you can move along and assume that

380
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
everything that's necessary to get that

381
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,079
job done

382
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,000
given whatever local conditions or

383
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
current events whatever else is

384
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
happening

385
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
that subroutine is going to encapsulate

386
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,680
everything that's needed to get it done

387
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,320
meaning it's

388
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
it's it's not just it's it's it's the

389
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,079
difference basically so for people who

390
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,279
code it's the difference between

391
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,600
sort of macro substitution where all

392
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
you're doing is

393
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
just you know it's a shorthand for a

394
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
bunch of hardwired steps which is

395
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
plopping that in i don't think that's

396
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
the the magic here at all i think what

397
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
it is is

398
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
is uh it's a degree of competency in

399
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,519
that subroutine to get something

400
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,560
accomplished

401
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
and and that that has really uh

402
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,880
really important implications for

403
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
evolvability and so on and

404
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
what the bioelectricity allows you to do

405
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
is to

406
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
uh basically to have um to have a

407
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,639
language

408
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
in which the system can call up such

409
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,760
such

410
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,639
circuits with specific behaviors um at

411
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
different points or at

412
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
different times that makes it that makes

413
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,839
it really really powerful

414
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,320
but um the question of whether it has

415
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
you know any kind of uh

416
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
formal syntax or anything like that i

417
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,200
don't have good evidence for that

418
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
i don't even mean like a formal syntax

419
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
it's it's almost like

420
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,200
it and and this also you know holds true

421
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
between these layers of these nested

422
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,760
layers of

423
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,880
organism or whatever um is is

424
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
if there's if you have a sense that

425
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
there's any abstraction there's any

426
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
abstraction layer needed

427
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
and i guess you kind of answered it

428
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,040
maybe by saying you know that

429
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
electricity is this medium

430
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,399
on which um things communicate or

431
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
but yeah anyway that it's i don't think

432
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,079
it's an easy it's like

433
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,760
you know easy to answer question but

434
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,199
that's the theme that keeps coming back

435
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,480
to me so

436
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,399
i i think there's a lot of abstraction

437
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,600
in the sense of

438
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
in and and i don't know if this captures

439
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
what you're asking but but there's a lot

440
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,600
of abstraction

441
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
in the sense of generalization um

442
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
in terms of um

443
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
another way to another way to say is is

444
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,279
is is corresponding

445
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,720
voltage itself let's just start with

446
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
that voltage itself is an abstraction

447
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,360
for cells because

448
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
and in fact people will often ask if i

449
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
say you know there's a bioelectrical

450
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,880
signal

451
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
they say well is it the potassium level

452
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
is it the sodium level

453
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
like what you know is it the particular

454
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
ion channel gene

455
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,839
is the voltage or is it the current yeah

456
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,680
yeah and in particular with so so the

457
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,360
cool thing about bioelectrics is that

458
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
with that question has been answered and

459
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,079
we know we know the answer

460
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
it's it's neither of those things so so

461
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,040
it's a pattern of voltage that is

462
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
specific for the downstream effects and

463
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
it doesn't matter how with very rare

464
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,120
exceptions it doesn't matter how you got

465
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
to that voltage so you can use sodium

466
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
channels you can use potassium channels

467
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
chloride

468
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
what ion used all those micro details

469
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,079
don't matter at all because what the

470
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,600
collective is keying off of

471
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,839
is the spatial temporal distribution of

472
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,839
voltage and you can get exactly the same

473
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,519
results with sodium or potassium or

474
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,800
chloride as long as you're

475
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
you know you're you're driving the right

476
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
voltage patterns so voltage itself is a

477
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
really cool abstraction because

478
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
it means that all the downs the

479
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
underlying mechanisms are free to

480
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
diverge in evolution you want to swap

481
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
out a potassium channel

482
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,199
for sodium channel you can do that as

483
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
long as uh you've got the right of

484
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
functional properties so that your

485
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
you know your overall pattern stays and

486
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
we use that quite often in our

487
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,399
regenerative medicine applications with

488
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
a really convenient um

489
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
convenient property so so yeah so so the

490
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
bioelectric code itself is definitely an

491
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,440
abstraction

492
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,920
over uh what the microstates in terms of

493
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
specific

494
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
ions or the specific channel genes that

495
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,560
got you there

496
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,199
nice stephen did you want to say hello

497
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
yes hello hello hi there i'm michael

498
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
thanks for joining us yeah i was curious

499
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,920
we had a really interest

500
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,759
chris field gave us a really good

501
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,560
insight into the quantum contextuality

502
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,920
idea of how things could build up from

503
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
different sort of space states at very

504
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
small levels and active inference often

505
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
uses non-equilibrium

506
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
steady steady-state attractors as kind

507
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
of a way to look at

508
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
some sort of statistics between the

509
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
scales you know there's some sort of

510
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,240
flux or um flow that's inferred

511
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
and i i find it really useful

512
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
thinking about it with this cone idea

513
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,199
that you you bring to the table because

514
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,759
it

515
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
it there's more it's more of an idea of

516
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
a distinct um swarming going into a

517
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,000
structure

518
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
and some sort of system that might

519
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
emerge from that which is sometimes

520
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
lost when it's very much in the math um

521
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
and i'm curious um whether when you

522
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,959
think about these

523
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,360
um the bi-electric effects and the same

524
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
sort of question came up with quantum

525
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
contextuality maybe is

526
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
is is there more of a distinct scale at

527
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,359
which

528
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
there's a coherence you know like you've

529
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
got the cell membrane then you've got a

530
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,439
coherence

531
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,319
around which the bioelectrics can

532
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,760
operate so to speak and then you might

533
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,319
have another distinct level at which

534
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,599
um the bioelectrics can operate

535
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,640
which is maybe more than the more

536
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
gradated idea

537
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
of steady state statistical um

538
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
sort of manifolds so i was wondering

539
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,440
what your thoughts are about how

540
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,160
and where there's sort of scales at

541
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,120
which

542
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
the bioelectrics become particularly um

543
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
coherent or if that even happens

544
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
yeah i mean so so again prefacing this

545
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,640
by saying that

546
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,440
the the bioelectrics is not an essential

547
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,880
part of the story

548
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
in except in so far as i think

549
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,960
morphogenesis

550
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
and is is a nice example of an

551
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
unconventional agent within which to uh

552
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
play with these kind of ideas you know

553
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
what so so what i would like to do and

554
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,360
and this is um a framework that i've

555
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,679
been

556
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
developing recently is to get away from

557
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
the standard

558
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
sorts of living creatures that we're

559
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
used to right so so the products of

560
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
that one trace of evolution in the in

561
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
the biosphere on earth

562
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
and to go beyond that and to look at the

563
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
space of possible agents the space of

564
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,480
possible bodies and the space of

565
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
possible minds that

566
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
those bodies will support and think you

567
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
know think more broadly so

568
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,919
in in in doing that um what i think the

569
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,760
bioelectrics in morphogenetic

570
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
well i think that morphogenesis is a

571
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,960
nice example of an

572
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
unconventional agent that lets us see

573
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
how the framework is to be practically

574
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,480
applied

575
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
right so so people say okay this is all

576
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,679
well and good but what what you know

577
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,640
what use is it

578
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,960
okay let's let's apply it to a specific

579
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,760
thing then

580
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,160
really no one thinks of as a as a

581
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
cognitive agent i'm going to show you

582
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,000
how all this stuff

583
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
maps and why it's useful at the bench

584
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
and it helps do new experiments and so

585
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,919
on

586
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,000
so if we if we accept that morphogenesis

587
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
is kind of a test case

588
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
for and there are many others it's

589
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
certainly not unique but it's a test

590
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,480
case for

591
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
an unconventional place to find um

592
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
agency and all of that and to test out

593
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
how well this theory helps us out

594
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,919
then what's cool about bioelectricity is

595
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
that it actually

596
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,760
allows us to tell a very specific

597
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
mechanistic testable

598
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,080
empirically useful story about how the

599
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,799
information

600
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,360
flow happens and how the levels scale

601
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
but it's just

602
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
one you know it's just that that's just

603
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
happens to be how the morphogenetic

604
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
um self does things and there are plenty

605
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
of other interesting

606
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
you know cells that wouldn't have

607
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
anything to do with bioelectricity i

608
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,640
just want to make that make that clear

609
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
right the bioelectricity is not

610
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
so you know some sort of essential um

611
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,919
element that's always going to be

612
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,440
present whenever we apply these things

613
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,840
it's just

614
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
sort of it's central to this to the to

615
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,919
the example case that i've trotted out

616
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
which is which is morphogenesis

617
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
now having said that bioelectricity is

618
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,400
definitely multi-scale because you have

619
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
uh you have you have bioelectric

620
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
dynamics in organelles in a very small

621
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,360
scale

622
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,600
you have uh the resting potential across

623
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,799
the cell membrane which is

624
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,760
mainly what what we study but those

625
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,039
scale into tissues

626
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,520
and you have global electrical fields

627
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,280
which are driven by trans epithelial

628
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,000
potentials

629
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
on the scale of tissues and organs which

630
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,760
other people like mensau and many other

631
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,000
people

632
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
study and then past that you have whole

633
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,679
animal

634
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,960
scale like whole body scale uh fields as

635
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,520
well

636
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,400
so all of these different levels you

637
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200
know exist

638
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
uh some of them more and some less rely

639
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
on bioelectricity but

640
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,000
um yeah it's it's it's relevant in this

641
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
particular unconventional agent it's

642
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
it's relevant to all the scales that we

643
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
as we know

644
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
okay that that's really helpful thanks

645
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,400
and and would you say that the the cone

646
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,480
concept could have extrapolated to other

647
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
types of multi-scale piston blanket

648
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
type ideas um and i just wonder what

649
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
your thoughts on that or whether that

650
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
just confuses things

651
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
to try that but um no i don't think it

652
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
confuses now i should

653
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
i'll i'll i'll say i'm i'm for sure not

654
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,679
i mean i i like

655
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,640
uh carl's ideas very much i'm by no

656
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
means an expert on the map and i'm not

657
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
gonna pretend that i understand all that

658
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
but um i i think that the the thing

659
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
about the thing about these kind of

660
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,159
diagrams is they're not to be

661
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,320
they're not meant to be unique or

662
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,200
exhaustive

663
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
so with the goal of this originally this

664
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,280
this came about

665
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,080
um a couple years ago um at a templeton

666
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,799
meeting where

667
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,000
we were asked to brainstorm ways to

668
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
define almost a sort of ident space

669
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
where you're you're able to compare

670
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,799
directly

671
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,440
really diverse intelligences right so so

672
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
things where you don't

673
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
you can't just uh measure all their

674
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
brains and then see how they you know

675
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
how they shake out it's it's

676
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
really really diverse intelligence and

677
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
so it's what i tried to come up with

678
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
is uh a scale and and it's all focused

679
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,919
around uh the the spatial temporal scale

680
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
of the goals that any given

681
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
agent can work towards and and the scale

682
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,559
of

683
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,400
um states of affairs that can be that

684
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
can stress out that agent when they're

685
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
not being met and so on

686
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,400
uh as a way to uh pick on something that

687
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
i think is central to all ages no matter

688
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
what they're made of no matter how they

689
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,039
got here evolve design

690
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,440
combinations chimeras whatever wherever

691
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
they came from and whatever they are

692
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
what is essential to them and and i

693
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
picked this this goal directing this but

694
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,120
but this is compatible with all kinds of

695
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
other systems

696
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
so you could overlay on top of this

697
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,960
almost

698
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
anything else that you thought was

699
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
critical about being an agent

700
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
just start adding dimensions you know

701
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
and and and absolutely

702
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,799
right now you can you can just you can

703
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
this this is compatible with all sorts

704
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,679
of things this is not meant

705
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
to rule out any other anybody else's you

706
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
know favorite and favorite framework

707
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,679
they're saying it captures one slice of

708
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,240
what's essential about being a self

709
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
thanks that's really useful actually can

710
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
i just one more thing blue i just

711
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,200
was i'm actually really interested in

712
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
this i do a lot of work with community

713
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
psychology

714
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
um so there's this challenge of going

715
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
from the cell there's like the self and

716
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,840
then there's

717
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,960
society social but the inter-subjective

718
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
kind of group dynamics is there's a big

719
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,679
problem because it's like a big hole

720
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
because it and and this i find it's

721
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
really useful because

722
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
a lot of stuff which talks about how

723
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
groups they often try to project out

724
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,000
into the future as if it's a light

725
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
beam that you could measure whereas here

726
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,360
it's much more you know like

727
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
it's sitting in the swarming i like to

728
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,679
think the bottom of the cone is almost

729
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
the swarming

730
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,919
dynamics that go down into the past

731
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
you've got the kind of structure of the

732
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
cell that's emerged

733
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
and then the system that's able to go

734
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,720
into

735
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,600
temporal depth in the future in the code

736
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
and i think that

737
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
that offers a nice way to think about

738
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,480
group dynamics particularly maybe the

739
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
more di

740
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,080
ironically the more challenging group

741
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,400
dynamics where there isn't a coherent

742
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,279
single narrative so there might be

743
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
applications there

744
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,159
yeah this is this is so super

745
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,600
interesting and i should i should say

746
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,039
one of the things about the cone and we

747
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
had a discussion about this yesterday

748
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039
um and pranav das pointed out that my

749
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,240
cone compared to

750
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
minkowski's coin is upside down right

751
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
it's it's uh and the reason i did it

752
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,120
this way

753
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,640
was because if you think about

754
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
um where where any any given agent the

755
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
only thing

756
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
the given agent is really certain of at

757
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,240
the

758
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,880
at the moment is what's going on right

759
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,520
now

760
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,559
so your future obviously is is uncertain

761
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
and when you're trying to predict so so

762
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
let's say you're trying to manage goals

763
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,080
and

764
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
and you're trying to predict you've got

765
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
some predictive capacity going forward

766
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,679
that predictive

767
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,440
capacity doesn't get better over time it

768
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
gets worse over time right

769
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
you're you're you're sort of

770
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
exponentially more uncertain about

771
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,840
what's going to happen later on so your

772
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
ability to pursue those goals in the

773
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,840
future

774
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,919
get smaller and smaller same thing goes

775
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,200
back in the past although you could

776
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,480
argue that that's linear and not

777
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,279
exponential

778
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
but again what you're doing at any given

779
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,320
moment in time

780
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,039
is inferring what your past was from the

781
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,279
engrams of memory that are available to

782
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
you they may be a brain they might be a

783
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
stigmatic a medium that you live in on

784
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
the you know within if you're in a

785
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,159
company colony whatever it's going to be

786
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
you've got some kind of material in

787
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,400
which

788
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,960
you leave me in which in which events

789
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
leave memories they leave traces

790
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,279
at any given moment you are reading

791
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,840
those traces recalling them and

792
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,159
reconstructing

793
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
what you think the past was that's your

794
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
only evidence for what the past

795
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
you know any given moment what actually

796
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,480
and so

797
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
and so you and so and so even going

798
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
backwards my cone comes down because

799
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,400
your ability to um to go backwards in

800
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
time and be certain of what went on and

801
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,279
when what are

802
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
what are the facts on which you can now

803
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
build your goal directed strategy going

804
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,240
forward

805
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
become more and more uncertain going

806
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,840
back so so that's that's why my you know

807
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,640
my cones are

808
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,559
are upside down in this in the so to

809
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
speak because also because there's no

810
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
particular reason this has to map

811
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
exactly onto you know minkowski's

812
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,640
informalism but but i think it's close

813
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
that just because that that

814
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
that your your level of certainty is

815
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
highest right now right both in space

816
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,279
and time and anything

817
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,120
when you step away from that it rapidly

818
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
you know at least for all of us

819
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720
rapidly um get smaller

820
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
yeah we were really actually talking

821
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
about this last week in our

822
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
discussion and we were kind of thinking

823
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,320
about this as like an information cone

824
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,760
because you have the most information

825
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,679
about your environment at this

826
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,919
point in space and less information as

827
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
you go forward and backward

828
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
in time so do you think that that might

829
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,640
be the

830
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,279
the correct way to think about it so so

831
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,480
that's true it's def

832
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
that's absolutely true it's definitely

833
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,360
also an information point but i want to

834
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
be clear about this because

835
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,039
um this diagram is not a diagram of

836
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,600
what you can sense or how far your

837
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,039
effectors range

838
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
this is which this is um the the the

839
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
what you just said about the information

840
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,760
certainty

841
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,200
is uh the the consequences of that are

842
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
that you also have a limited cone in

843
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
what the diagram really is supposed to

844
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,520
show

845
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,000
which is the scale of the goals towards

846
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,279
which you can work

847
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,720
so so because the information is smaller

848
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
your ability to pursue goals towards you

849
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
know how far into the future are

850
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,679
am i actively you know doing it just it

851
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,640
just becomes limited

852
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
right your your ability to do so so it's

853
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,559
sort of a secondary um

854
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,799
a consequence of that but but i just

855
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,000
want to be clear that this is this is

856
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
not meant to be fundamentally a picture

857
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,000
of

858
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,840
the information certainty of sensory

859
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,200
capacity of

860
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
um effector range or anything like that

861
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
this is this is a diagram

862
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,399
in um in gold space

863
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,720
nice so one of the other ways i've been

864
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
thinking about it is kind of like a

865
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
possibility cone

866
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,000
so like as you progress forward into the

867
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
future we all

868
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,440
are left with one possibility and that's

869
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,960
like death right so your

870
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,760
goal at that moment is death um and

871
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,360
similarly in the past like we all come

872
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,320
from a single

873
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
celled like you know fertilization event

874
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
and so like we all started an event and

875
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
ended an event and like the maximum

876
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
possibility is

877
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,360
is now so what do you think about that

878
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,120
yeah i mean so so that's a really

879
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,559
interesting point right and people talk

880
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,120
about

881
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
you know great transitions in uh in in

882
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
cognition along the continuum and so on

883
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
and so i think one great cognition of a

884
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
great transition is the following

885
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,320
if you are a creature with a horizon

886
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,679
with a with a with a

887
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,720
cognitive horizon of you know a half an

888
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
hour your goldfish or something i don't

889
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,440
know if this is factually true but you

890
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,000
know you're some you're

891
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
some sort of um form that has a

892
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,200
cognitive horizon of a half an hour

893
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,919
right

894
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,279
what that means is that all of your uh

895
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,440
major goals survival and these other

896
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
things they're totally achievable

897
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,799
right because it is completely plausible

898
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,159
that you are going to make it for that

899
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,320
half hour that you can project forward

900
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,120
if you are a human and your cognitive

901
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
horizon your your goals

902
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,039
are you know i don't know world peace or

903
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,080
your buildings you know

904
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
the larger things you are for the first

905
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,760
time perhaps along

906
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
the earth's lineage anyway you are able

907
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,960
to to

908
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
to uh comprehend goals that you have no

909
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
chance whatsoever of achieving

910
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
because you because you because you have

911
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
a limited lifespan so now that's and

912
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
that's a that's a really sharp um

913
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
transition you know kind of an emergent

914
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,039
transition because for the first time

915
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,039
you are able to undertake goals that you

916
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,480
know you are not going to complete

917
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,120
guarantee

918
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
right whereas the fish essence you know

919
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,760
maybe you'll get eaten and maybe you

920
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
won't but it's totally plausible that

921
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,399
you you know that you live for the half

922
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
hour that you can see forward for the

923
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,000
very humans have that and so i suspect

924
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,399
that this is uh and this is you know

925
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,240
sort of way above my opinion to know

926
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,279
details about this but

927
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,720
but i suspect this drives a lot of um

928
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,080
the weird facts about human psychology

929
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,600
because you now have this fundamental

930
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,240
stressor

931
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,320
that other creatures don't have because

932
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,000
you're able to foresee all these goals

933
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
that you are definitely not going to

934
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,080
to meet and and that's that's a novel

935
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,880
you know sort of

936
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,080
um a conflict between the different

937
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,200
modules that

938
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
that doesn't exist doesn't exist for i

939
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,480
think for most other creatures

940
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
yeah that's really interesting you know

941
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,799
something that i might be like uniquely

942
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,760
human

943
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,200
is like this possibility to see past

944
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,399
like the cone of our own existence like

945
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,679
into the future

946
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,679
uh with these like future possibilities

947
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,679
or future goal states and also like

948
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
backwards into the past in like a

949
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,480
historical sense so we all like look at

950
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
history

951
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,039
um so i don't know i like thinking about

952
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
like you know i've just been reading

953
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,240
your recent paper this

954
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,320
integrating evolutionary developmental

955
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
thinking into scale free biology this

956
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
paper with chris fields

957
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
um and i know like when we spoke

958
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,000
yesterday you mentioned you were

959
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
integrating these ideas maybe into your

960
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
next paper but

961
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
in that paper you guys were kind of

962
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
blurring the boundary really between

963
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
the processes of evolution and

964
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,840
development

965
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
and you know phylogenetic memory that's

966
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,679
contained in dna

967
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,600
and results from evolution like

968
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,200
transforms into this onto

969
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
genetic yeah yeah definitely so so

970
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,799
there's a couple of really interesting

971
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,279
things

972
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,279
related to that to evolution that we

973
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,720
that we can talk about and that's that's

974
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
something i'm working on now and this

975
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,960
thing should be done then

976
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
in a couple of weeks and then we'll see

977
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,159
um

978
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,360
two things number one um one of the

979
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,000
things

980
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
but one of the amazing things about

981
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,679
biological hardware that that's given to

982
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,039
us by evolution

983
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,799
is that it is there's a default

984
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
way by that i mean cells but they're

985
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,840
genomically determined

986
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,640
proteins whatever they have uh there's a

987
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
default and a pretty con

988
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
robust consistent default outcome right

989
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
and and so so embryo you know fish

990
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
embryos make fish and progress make

991
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
frogs and so on

992
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
but there's an incredible amount of

993
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
plasticity there so that those

994
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,919
exact same cells genetically wild type

995
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,519
so the hardware is all the same

996
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,120
are in fact in other types of

997
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
environments are able to make

998
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,559
completely novel um

999
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,399
creatures right and so some of this so

1000
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,080
synthetic synthetic biology and

1001
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,519
synthetic morphology is already showing

1002
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,240
this we we

1003
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,919
you know as our zenobots and things like

1004
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,600
this and then there will be tons more

1005
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,559
going forward that what's interest one

1006
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,600
thing that's interesting about those

1007
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,799
novel creatures

1008
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,000
is that you don't have a long history

1009
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,799
of uh select specific selection and

1010
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,399
frozen accidents and all this you know

1011
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,519
phylogenetics

1012
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,399
to uh lean on when you ask why do they

1013
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,440
do certain things

1014
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
right so for every normal animal in the

1015
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,799
in the biosphere you say why is this

1016
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,200
thing

1017
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
you know green and why does it fly and

1018
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
how come it has these antennas the

1019
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
answer is always the same well because

1020
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
for millions of years the ancestors were

1021
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,880
selected for this event

1022
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,360
the fact that we can take those embryos

1023
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
those cells rather

1024
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
cell cells from from from those kind of

1025
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
animals and put them together

1026
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
into a new creature that has goals

1027
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
and behaviors more morphological goals

1028
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,279
behavioral goals physiological goals

1029
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,080
that basically appear overnight you know

1030
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,880
within

1031
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,080
24 48 hours they sort of show up

1032
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,640
um and then the then the question is

1033
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,159
where did these things come from because

1034
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,279
what they didn't do

1035
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,600
was uh to be honed over millions of

1036
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
years by specific selection pressure so

1037
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,360
so that that's a very interesting to me

1038
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,559
to me aspect of the plasticity here that

1039
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
it is not you know they the history

1040
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
doesn't necessarily

1041
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,279
determine them other than

1042
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,960
the default you know sort of variant and

1043
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,399
where does that come from and then

1044
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,840
there's a whole thing which you know i

1045
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,799
don't know you can tell me if you want

1046
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,440
to

1047
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,679
dive deeper into this or not but the

1048
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
whole um

1049
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,000
the fact that you have multiple layers

1050
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,320
and that you have competency going down

1051
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,159
you know sort of all the way down has

1052
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,519
massive implications for

1053
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,159
why evolution works so fast right why

1054
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,440
why actually anything

1055
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
is able to evolve on the on the time

1056
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
scale that we see so i think

1057
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,320
you know if you're interested we can get

1058
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
into that yeah that's great why don't we

1059
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
uh unpack that

1060
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
okay um yeah let's let's let's talk

1061
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
about that a little bit um

1062
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,880
imagine imagine two kinds of creatures

1063
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
and uh you've got one kind of creature

1064
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,240
where the genome has a pretty direct

1065
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,799
um influence over what the anatomy is

1066
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,840
going to be it's

1067
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,760
everything is hardwired in some in some

1068
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,039
sense and so let's say

1069
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
let's let's let's visualize you've got

1070
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,079
let's let's say it's a you know it's a

1071
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
frog of some kind

1072
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,679
and uh and and and there's the genome

1073
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,359
and it makes a frog and that's what it

1074
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,480
does and so now

1075
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
now we imagine evolution is sort of

1076
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,918
searching the space and now there's a

1077
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,800
mutation

1078
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
and the mutation does two things uh

1079
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
because most mutations do multiple

1080
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,520
things let's say we got a mutation that

1081
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,320
there's two things it it moves the eyes

1082
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
off kilter right and it also

1083
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,639
has some really beneficial uh effect

1084
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,079
somewhere else you know it helps with

1085
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,199
some other things

1086
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,040
most mutations are clear tropics so it's

1087
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
it's um it's a reasonable

1088
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,199
reasonable conjecture if you're if your

1089
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,719
animal is

1090
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,760
uh the hardwired kind the eyes are in

1091
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,839
the wrong place nothing works

1092
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
you the evolution never gets to explore

1093
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,520
the positive benefits of this other

1094
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,639
mutation

1095
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,239
because the thing's going to be dead you

1096
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,640
know it's just it's just not a workable

1097
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
animal anymore the fitness is very low

1098
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
it's gone and so most when if you think

1099
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,599
about these kind of hardwired things

1100
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,359
it's the same when i when i first you

1101
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,040
know now 100 years ago when i first

1102
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,839
heard about

1103
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,520
how evolutionary algorithms are supposed

1104
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,680
to work this idea that i've got a system

1105
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,640
that does something i'm going to start

1106
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
throwing random changes in

1107
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
anybody that's written any code that

1108
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,119
they are you crazy of course

1109
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,240
everything's going to get worse not

1110
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
better that's never going to work

1111
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
now imagine imagine a different now of

1112
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
course it works but it takes it takes

1113
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
massive amounts of time and

1114
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,119
and so and there's all these

1115
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,720
difficulties about evolving complex

1116
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,200
things

1117
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,119
now imagine what we actually have the

1118
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,640
actual and i'll explain the the

1119
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
biological um example that's when you

1120
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:36,880
have

1121
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,800
you have a tadpole and the temple has to

1122
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
move all of its uh

1123
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,839
oregon's craniofacial organs around to

1124
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,599
become a fraud so the jaws have to come

1125
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,280
out the nostrils move the eyes move

1126
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
forward like everything all this stuff

1127
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
moves around and

1128
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,560
you could have a hard-wired animal in

1129
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
which every

1130
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
every organ moves in the right direction

1131
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,960
a particular a distance and that's it

1132
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
right and that that's you that's your

1133
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,119
hard-wired thing that actually is not

1134
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,520
what um how animals work so so if we and

1135
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
so what we did a few years ago is we

1136
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,800
make what we call these picasso tadpoles

1137
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
the idea is you make these tadpoles

1138
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,599
everything's in the wrong place the eyes

1139
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,880
are on the back of the head the mouth is

1140
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,320
off to the side the nostrils are up here

1141
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,520
like it's just scratched

1142
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,400
like mr potato everything's scrambled so

1143
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
if it was a hard-wired

1144
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
system then all of these things would

1145
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,920
move the traditional amount in the

1146
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,880
traditional direction

1147
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
and everything would be way off because

1148
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,079
you're starting in the wrong spot

1149
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,520
instead what happens is that all of

1150
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
these organs move in novel paths

1151
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
and they keep moving and sometimes they

1152
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,520
overshoot and have to come back

1153
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
but they keep moving until they build a

1154
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,040
correct frog face and then they stop

1155
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,920
moving

1156
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
so now that system so so what the

1157
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
genetics actually gives you it doesn't

1158
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,119
it doesn't somehow give you a hard-wired

1159
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,200
set of movements what it does do

1160
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,839
is give you an error minimization scheme

1161
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,240
that

1162
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
can progressively uh deform the system

1163
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,240
uh until the error from some sort of set

1164
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,119
point and we've been

1165
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,560
studying you know what the set point is

1166
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,640
we can talk about that uh

1167
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
until the error with from that set point

1168
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
gets to an acceptably low level

1169
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,280
so what you have here is a competent set

1170
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
of craniofacial organs

1171
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
that are going to move around and and

1172
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,560
get to where they need to go

1173
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,079
even if they start off in the wrong

1174
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,680
position so now look at what happens

1175
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
with evolution right you got your

1176
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,839
mutation

1177
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,400
the the eyes and the jaws now are off in

1178
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
the wrong place

1179
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
but now you've got this benefit

1180
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,880
somewhere else the the thing is the eyes

1181
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
and the jaws are going to get fixed

1182
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
you don't need to worry about that

1183
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
because they're going to they know where

1184
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,480
they belong they're going to get there

1185
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,839
even though they start out in the wrong

1186
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,079
position so that aspect

1187
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,480
that negative aspect of that mutation

1188
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,680
gets hidden

1189
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
from selection for a while anyway

1190
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,920
because um and eventually it'll it'll

1191
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
you know it'll catalyze into into the

1192
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,680
genome itself but but for a while

1193
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
it gets hidden from selection allowing

1194
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,599
evolution to explore

1195
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,760
the benefits of of the other benefits of

1196
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,720
that mutation

1197
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,960
so so here's all in summary here's

1198
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,240
here's what this means the fact that you

1199
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,760
have competent subunits and they're

1200
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,200
competent morphologically they're

1201
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,960
competent physiologically we can talk

1202
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
about what that means

1203
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
the fact that they're all competent

1204
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,200
means that the uh the fitness landscape

1205
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,440
is

1206
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,760
is much less rugged it's much it's much

1207
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,640
smoother

1208
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,320
it means that uh your um the effects of

1209
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
mutations are much more linear

1210
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
meaning that you can you can examine

1211
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,599
each consequence

1212
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,760
uh independently because the other

1213
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,839
consequences can be masked by

1214
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,480
by things you know if by the local

1215
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
environment being off it doesn't matter

1216
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,760
it'll things still get where they need

1217
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,520
to go and connect and so on

1218
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,440
so so it makes it makes the search

1219
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,320
process way more easier by

1220
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,560
uh by allowing you to and it gives you

1221
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,680
patience it means that

1222
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,599
evolution doesn't have to solve every

1223
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,359
problem at once you don't have to wait

1224
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,040
until you find a mutation that

1225
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,599
gives you a positive impact and leaves

1226
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,359
the eyes where they need to be

1227
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,720
you don't need to wait for that if you

1228
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,480
can you can grab the first mutation you

1229
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
find that gives you the positive impact

1230
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,680
because the i think will get taken care

1231
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,280
of because because those subunits are

1232
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,839
confident

1233
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
so it's what raises the iq of the whole

1234
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,680
system the search becomes a much

1235
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
much smarter search it has it has some

1236
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,839
patience it's able to see linearly

1237
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,119
instead of um sort of highly uh

1238
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,320
um you know mixed up uh

1239
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,599
all of the consequences of these

1240
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,440
mutations and it smooths the fitness

1241
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,000
landscape

1242
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,280
so i think when you can count on your uh

1243
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,359
your components to do some of the heavy

1244
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,880
lifting you don't have to micromanage

1245
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,440
all of it

1246
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
uh the evolutionary search gets

1247
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
massively more efficient

1248
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,040
and now it because it starts to become a

1249
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
little more plausible

1250
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
that we actually see this you know this

1251
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,760
amazing biosphere

1252
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
actually evolved by a process of random

1253
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,760
mutation

1254
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,320
nice so in that same paper you talk

1255
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,240
about random mutation but then you

1256
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,960
also describe this kind of modularity of

1257
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
gene groups and the possibility of

1258
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
entire gene families

1259
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
like the hox cluster duplicating and

1260
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
driving the major evolutionary

1261
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
transitions

1262
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,880
is this a sort of non-random process

1263
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,079
sort of ergodicity

1264
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,079
breaking with perhaps like non-linear

1265
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,000
effects when these entire clusters

1266
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
yeah i i hesitate to say too much

1267
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,079
because i don't think much is known

1268
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,480
there that i can say definitively i

1269
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,920
think that you know this whole issue of

1270
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
random and non-random mutations is very

1271
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,880
um you know controversial obviously i

1272
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
suspect

1273
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,440
that there is a notion of mutate of of

1274
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,359
evolutionary search that's not quite

1275
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,000
blind

1276
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
so so people often will argue you know

1277
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,359
either they

1278
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
most people nowadays evolution is

1279
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,800
completely blind you know it just

1280
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,240
that makes these mutations whatever

1281
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,640
happens is not because of any

1282
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,880
uh directionality in the search space

1283
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,480
and then and then you know you've got

1284
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
you've got you have people who think

1285
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,280
that it's directed towards a specific

1286
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,240
outcome i

1287
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,560
i think there's a there's a sort of

1288
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
in-between scenario where

1289
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,119
it's definitely not directed in the

1290
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,400
sense that you can see

1291
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,040
far forward in the search space but it

1292
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,960
doesn't have to be completely blind

1293
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,359
in that maybe what it has this comes out

1294
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,280
of some discussions i've had with both

1295
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
chris fields and richard watson that

1296
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,960
that maybe instead of a point

1297
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
in fitness space what you really have is

1298
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
a little bit of a vector you have

1299
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
almost like a comet trail right and then

1300
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,640
it gives you a little bit of um

1301
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,400
a little bit of information about

1302
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,240
direction about you know and

1303
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,960
and and and you can imagine i mean i can

1304
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,119
sort of design in my head

1305
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,440
an epigenetic system of marking things

1306
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,480
on the dna that

1307
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,520
give you a little bit of about

1308
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,119
information well what was this allele

1309
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,000
last time

1310
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,599
right so that you can sort of say well

1311
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,200
i've been turning i've been turning this

1312
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,480
knob in this direction and things are

1313
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
going well so maybe i want to turn it

1314
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,319
some more

1315
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,440
that kind of thing and this is totally

1316
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
made up i'm not saying that that we know

1317
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,560
that biology actually does this it's

1318
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,280
just

1319
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,880
maybe it doesn't then maybe synthetic

1320
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
biology maybe we implement this on you

1321
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
know just for the first time we engineer

1322
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,880
it

1323
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,319
but i think it's possible to make a

1324
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,480
system that does that and maybe

1325
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
um collections of genes and some of the

1326
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
complex chromatin

1327
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,720
um epigenetics that go on maybe they're

1328
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
part of that process but this is this is

1329
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,040
total

1330
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,839
conjecture at this point so sarah i know

1331
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,119
you have a question but i'm going to use

1332
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,880
my moderator's privilege here and just

1333
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
ask do you think that this vector-driven

1334
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,800
mutation could be perhaps driven by

1335
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
active inference some kind of vector

1336
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,280
between

1337
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,760
exploration and exploitation happening

1338
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,839
yeah and so and so one of the things

1339
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,960
that that we've

1340
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,359
we talked about i mean that i'm to write

1341
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,000
after this next

1342
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,800
thing is out is is is really on this

1343
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,240
idea that maybe

1344
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,599
um the whole evolutionary evolutionary

1345
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,119
lineage of a particular

1346
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,880
um of you know particular um

1347
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
the animal plant or whatever it is uh

1348
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
maybe that's the

1349
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,680
maybe that's an agent as well just

1350
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,760
stretched out massively over space

1351
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
such that each at any given point in

1352
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,280
time all of the off

1353
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,640
all of the existing uh uh um examples of

1354
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,520
that species

1355
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,839
are in fact hypotheses about the space

1356
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,680
right and that what you're doing what

1357
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,800
that what you're doing is

1358
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,359
is you're constantly generating genomes

1359
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:51,839
as

1360
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,400
as hypotheses and some of those genomes

1361
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,960
are

1362
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,160
you know proven to be some of those

1363
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,760
hypotheses are proven good and some are

1364
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,400
not

1365
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
and then the next you know sort of the

1366
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
next set of genomes is not completely

1367
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,560
random

1368
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,200
but it's in some way uh part of this

1369
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,920
part of the

1370
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
um active inference of this giant is

1371
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,359
sort of

1372
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,400
you know virtual agent right so i think

1373
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
there's a story to be told like that

1374
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,560
uh but it's way more hand waving than

1375
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,079
details at this point

1376
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,880
awesome thanks sarah yeah my comment is

1377
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,960
now maybe a little bit stale but i think

1378
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,640
i'll put it out there anyway just for

1379
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,160
the sake of making

1380
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,920
saying something concrete because a lot

1381
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,000
of this feels a bit abstract like

1382
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,240
um and i'm hoping i'm even remembering

1383
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,000
this anecdote right but i remember

1384
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,920
uh learning that some gene once upon a

1385
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,640
time

1386
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,760
um that gave us um

1387
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,839
an extra writer cone in our eye allowed

1388
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,680
us better color reception

1389
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,839
also was the same gene that um shut off

1390
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,240
our ability to make our own vitamin c

1391
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,319
and um if that's correct if i'm

1392
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,680
remembering that correct that's such an

1393
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,200
interesting example of

1394
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,359
of yeah of course it's an example of the

1395
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,119
of the fact that genes do multiple

1396
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,280
things but but it was kind of like isn't

1397
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,960
that coincidental you know that

1398
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,079
that this um

1399
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,119
that that gene is is doing you know both

1400
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,400
something for the eye but then

1401
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,000
also making it so that you can get your

1402
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,520
own vitamin c you know by

1403
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,960
by looking at fruit and i just thought

1404
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,880
that was that that kept coming to me as

1405
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,480
an example of what you guys were talking

1406
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,119
about

1407
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,640
um but it's stale sort of thanks sarah

1408
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,520
i'm sorry for

1409
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:37,839
making your comments still uh stephen

1410
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,000
yeah sort of following on it's this

1411
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,319
you have this idea of like um a goal

1412
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,040
space or a tedeological space in a way

1413
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,440
that's really interesting and then with

1414
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,560
that exploit

1415
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,000
or explore you i wonder if there's a

1416
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,520
time when

1417
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,240
there's there's a thought about when

1418
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,280
things are

1419
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,440
very directed and of course our western

1420
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,280
thinking we tend to think about a nice

1421
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
pointed cone

1422
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,040
um where we go into the future and we

1423
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,200
because we sculpt the world around us

1424
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,000
we maybe have like a a distinctive

1425
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,960
trajectory

1426
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,280
because we we kind of we're constructing

1427
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,079
our world

1428
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,599
more and more which is probably part of

1429
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,839
our problem to make it the way we want

1430
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,960
it to be

1431
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
um whereas particularly if you look at

1432
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,960
indigenous cultures they would have

1433
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,760
you know a cyclical the more cyclical

1434
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,800
approach which would go

1435
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,520
through seven generations or different

1436
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,200
levels of generations and would be

1437
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,400
attuning

1438
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,920
to the environment and i'm kind of

1439
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,000
curious whether and again this might be

1440
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,520
where we don't really know but

1441
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,000
is there a point at which there's

1442
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
generally trying to come back

1443
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,760
uh or maintain in the allostasis

1444
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,839
the kind of the cyclical sort of pattern

1445
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,520
that is where we want to go to and is

1446
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,119
there a time when it's like okay we're

1447
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,760
we're branching out now like we've made

1448
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,280
a jump and we're going to try and

1449
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,440
inscribe our environment at different

1450
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,119
scales from the body out

1451
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,400
to sort of now maintain some new

1452
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,680
kind of steady state attractor and how

1453
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,760
that might fit with this

1454
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,240
yeah i mean i think i i i think you're

1455
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,760
absolutely right in that some

1456
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,720
future version of this is going to have

1457
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,599
to

1458
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,760
uh be able to deal with goals that are

1459
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,520
not only not static meaning they're

1460
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,400
cyclical

1461
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,440
but also um

1462
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,680
goals that are themselves you know let's

1463
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,720
say second order

1464
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,520
goals like like my goal is it's a

1465
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,160
derivative

1466
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,680
my goal is to get better at something

1467
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,280
it's not a particular level that i'm

1468
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,079
looking for

1469
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,040
but i want a particular slope of some

1470
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,079
variable being

1471
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,079
you know particular right so something

1472
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,440
like that so so

1473
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,200
you're absolutely right i started out

1474
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,720
with the simplest you know this is sort

1475
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,240
of the hydrogen atom of this thing so i

1476
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,839
started out with something very simple

1477
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,280
that it's homeostatic

1478
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,040
as in your your goal is a is to achieve

1479
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,359
a particular region in whatever space

1480
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,720
you're solving problems and be that

1481
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,760
morphe space or

1482
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,599
physiological space your goal is to find

1483
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,880
that region and sit there

1484
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
and and that of course is not all there

1485
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,319
is to life obviously that's just the

1486
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,520
first you know kind of stuff

1487
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,119
i just did that for simplicity because i

1488
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,640
want to tackle everything at once and

1489
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,400
and there needs to be a lot done here

1490
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,760
before we get to that point

1491
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,680
um but yeah you're absolutely right your

1492
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,079
your goal state in that space may not be

1493
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,240
a point it may be some interesting

1494
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,800
you know bigger bigger bigger shape you

1495
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,160
know and this thing and and i just want

1496
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,240
to i wanted to say something about

1497
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,839
these gold spaces because i think it's

1498
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,680
it's it's interesting to to point this

1499
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,160
out

1500
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,839
so um one of the

1501
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,839
in this in this this all came out of a

1502
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
meeting on diverse intelligences and and

1503
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,359
so one thing i've been thinking about is

1504
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:45,920
what

1505
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
what is intelligence and you know what

1506
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,000
are these agents actually trying to do

1507
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,119
and okay so so we have lots of examples

1508
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,079
of problem solving in three-dimensional

1509
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,440
space right so you've got

1510
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,880
you know pros and monkeys and everything

1511
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,760
else and they're running around and

1512
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,640
trying to solve

1513
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,920
problems by moving around in

1514
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,079
three-dimensional space but but

1515
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,480
all the different um subunits of the of

1516
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,599
of bodies

1517
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,359
are solving problems in other kinds of

1518
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,960
spaces so we talked about amorphous

1519
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,440
space

1520
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,760
so if you are an eye in the head of a

1521
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,640
frog

1522
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,040
you are working in a space of possible

1523
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
configurations of where you are relative

1524
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,319
to everything else

1525
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,800
and you are trying to move and and act

1526
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,079
in a way that is going to

1527
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,040
to um to acquire to a particular region

1528
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
of amorphous space that describes

1529
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,960
that that the correct frog head that's

1530
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,319
that's where you're trying to land

1531
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,160
there's also a physiological space so

1532
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,599
i'll just give you a simple example

1533
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,240
that's that

1534
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,119
that we found recently so so um these

1535
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,160
these flat worms these

1536
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,760
planaria uh you you take these planaria

1537
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,240
and you throw them in barium okay so a

1538
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,599
solution of bearing

1539
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
now uh what happens is the barium is a

1540
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
non-selective potassium channel blocker

1541
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,920
it it blocks all the potassium channels

1542
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,200
all the cells freak out their head

1543
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,280
their heads literally explode right over

1544
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,480
overnight you know their heads just

1545
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,119
degenerate

1546
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,839
they're gone if you take those planaria

1547
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:02,960
and you leave them

1548
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,160
in fresh barium over

1549
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,559
the next you know 10 20 days what they

1550
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,760
will do is they will build

1551
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
new heads that are completely barium and

1552
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,200
sensitive

1553
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,640
couldn't care less no problem at all

1554
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
they live in barrie which is fine so

1555
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,319
we we we asked the simple question and

1556
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,920
not not because the answer has to be

1557
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
this but just because that's the tool

1558
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,920
that

1559
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
that was available we asked the simple

1560
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
question what is transcriptionally

1561
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,599
different about barium adapted heads

1562
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,480
from normal heads

1563
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,559
right so what genes are different

1564
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,920
differently expressed in

1565
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,839
in these in these heads and so what you

1566
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,040
find out is that

1567
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,599
out of tens of thousands of genes that

1568
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
these planaria have

1569
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,319
they managed to regulate a very small

1570
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,520
number on the order of of a couple dozen

1571
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,440
that allow them now to do their business

1572
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
despite the fact that potassium is no

1573
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,000
longer

1574
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,680
usable for them so now this is

1575
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,960
incredible because think about the

1576
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,400
problem that they're solving i

1577
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,000
you know my head i always visualize like

1578
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,680
one of those nuclear reactor control

1579
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,040
rooms with buttons everywhere

1580
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,880
so each button is a different gene you

1581
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,319
can you what are you going to do you

1582
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,079
have a physiological stressor

1583
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,760
you can't pass potassium everything's

1584
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,280
everything's going to happen

1585
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,839
you have some tens of thousands of genes

1586
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,760
that you could turn on and off

1587
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,559
the combinatorics are astronomical you

1588
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,599
don't have time

1589
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,240
to try them all you don't even have time

1590
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,440
for gradient descent

1591
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,280
you don't reproduce fast enough it's not

1592
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,800
like bacteria where you could say well

1593
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,000
they're all random and then somebody

1594
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,599
will survive and repopulate ahead they

1595
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,280
don't they don't divide that fast

1596
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,480
so you don't have time for any kind of

1597
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
evolutionary explanation within

1598
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
some small number of days you have to

1599
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,920
home in on

1600
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,559
a small number of genes knowing that if

1601
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,160
you just start randomly flipping them up

1602
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,520
and down you're going to make things

1603
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,040
worse long before you make them better

1604
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,160
you're going to kill everything off you

1605
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,280
just randomly start

1606
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,200
so now the other important fact about

1607
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
this is that um planaria never

1608
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,680
see barium in the wild so so planaria

1609
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,359
there's no evolutionary history of being

1610
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,079
good at

1611
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,920
surviving in barium because they don't

1612
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,599
see bearing so now

1613
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,920
to me this is an amazing example of of

1614
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,520
problem solving in a high dimensional

1615
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,200
virtual space you've got this

1616
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,400
you've got this um physiological space

1617
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,839
and your problem is your your your

1618
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,200
problem is physiological

1619
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,960
your effectors are transcriptional

1620
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,559
largely of course you have physiological

1621
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,319
effects too but you're trying to walk in

1622
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:14,720
this

1623
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,800
in this space and you have to somehow

1624
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,839
map

1625
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,280
it's unbelievable how they do this you

1626
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,440
somehow have to map your effectors in in

1627
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,880
transcriptional space

1628
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,000
to what's happening to you in

1629
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,079
physiological space and then rapidly get

1630
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,480
to

1631
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,839
a a workable uh a workable region

1632
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,599
so so that that gives you an idea of

1633
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,880
what of what we're talking about right

1634
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,559
these spaces can be

1635
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,200
um transcriptional physiological all you

1636
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,839
know all

1637
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,160
all kinds um and and these things and

1638
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,760
they solve their problems and like

1639
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,079
and like you pointed out the correct the

1640
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,440
thing you're trying to achieve may not

1641
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,240
be a point

1642
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,680
is certainly not a point and let's face

1643
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,839
it but it may not even be a static area

1644
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,960
it may be some sort of

1645
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,119
i would like to sort of wander in this

1646
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,480
you know kind of weird loop that's

1647
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,000
that's my goal right is to

1648
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
you know it's just to wander in some

1649
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,359
sort of weirdly shaped attractor yeah

1650
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,960
well we'll get to that this is the just

1651
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,880
you know first step

1652
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,599
just just one just also just just just

1653
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,040
one question following up from that just

1654
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
before sarah um

1655
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,119
so if i'm right what you're saying is

1656
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,800
gradient descent because that would have

1657
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,000
to come

1658
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,839
so from where you are and slowly keep

1659
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,480
incrementing you

1660
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,359
there's somehow some there's some goal

1661
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,400
states i mean

1662
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,040
maybe there's some evolutionary history

1663
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,960
even if it's not barium something like

1664
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,680
barium

1665
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,800
but but somehow it's not it's not only

1666
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,359
going

1667
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,800
from adjacent possibilities

1668
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,920
it's it's somehow jumping ahead is that

1669
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,040
what you're saying

1670
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,640
so so the first thing i'm saying is that

1671
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,160
i don't have any idea how it works right

1672
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,319
so so i do not i am not claiming i have

1673
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,040
a good

1674
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,640
a model for what's going on here but but

1675
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,079
i think you're on to something which is

1676
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:48,640
that

1677
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,400
i think and i think we talked about this

1678
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,839
a few minutes ago which was

1679
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,319
um abstraction and generalization i

1680
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,680
think you're exactly right i think what

1681
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,119
the system is able to do

1682
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,640
is is to say okay i don't know what this

1683
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,280
barium is but i've been terribly

1684
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,440
depolarized before it was an epileptic

1685
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,599
you know kind of a thing and this is an

1686
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,880
awful lot like that so

1687
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,200
i'm gonna generalize what just happened

1688
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,800
to this other thing that i do know how

1689
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,599
to deal with

1690
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,960
right and i'm going to move in that

1691
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,040
direction so that's my that's my gut

1692
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,800
feeling i don't have a solid model for

1693
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,200
this and

1694
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,160
that's not been proven in any way um but

1695
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,920
i have a feeling that you're that that's

1696
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,200
where the answer is going to be it's

1697
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,920
going to be

1698
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,800
that each and that that it's able to do

1699
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,640
this because it is able to recognize

1700
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,200
this

1701
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,680
physiological problem as an instance of

1702
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,599
a larger class of things for which it

1703
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,119
does know how to do

1704
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,359
and i think that when we talk about

1705
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,800
intelligence for all of these agents

1706
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,640
what we're really saying is

1707
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,839
it's your ability to navigate these

1708
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,960
various spaces uh if

1709
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,720
efficiently and without getting trapped

1710
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,960
in local minima that they kill you right

1711
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,359
being

1712
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,760
being able to step temporarily you know

1713
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,960
it's that patience it's that

1714
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,559
it's that being able to step away from

1715
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,480
the direct line to your goal to then

1716
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,760
come around and

1717
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,559
um and get i have sometimes when i talk

1718
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,920
about this i have a picture of this

1719
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,359
there's a fence and there's a couple of

1720
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,720
dogs on either side of the fence and

1721
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,920
they're just like you know trying to get

1722
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,800
at each other right

1723
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,400
there's a hole in the fence four feet

1724
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
away so they could do it

1725
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,160
the problem is it temporarily requires

1726
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,000
you to get away from get further from

1727
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,720
your goal right

1728
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,160
so that ability you're trapped in this

1729
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,319
local local local maximum

1730
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,079
and um your intelligence is is directly

1731
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,079
uh sort of proportional to your ability

1732
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,880
to temporarily

1733
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,559
get further from your goal in order to

1734
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,319
actually get into a better position

1735
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:34,960
later on

1736
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,040
part of the iq but i think the other

1737
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,559
part of the iq is this kind of

1738
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,599
generalization

1739
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,359
right and i and i think you're right i

1740
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,880
think that's probably what is gonna end

1741
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,440
up explaining

1742
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
nice sarah um man this is great

1743
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,839
uh i this is this question is probably

1744
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:52,960
out of bounds but if you have any

1745
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,760
thoughts on it

1746
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,280
then great if not pass um i mean this uh

1747
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,119
the the cone type diagram and the

1748
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,040
the agential um helios that it assumes

1749
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,200
i'm just wondering if you feel

1750
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,359
like there's any applicability to to

1751
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:11,839
non-agential

1752
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,000
type phenomena like you know complex

1753
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,160
systems or hurricanes or whatever um

1754
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,880
because

1755
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,280
it just when we're talking about

1756
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,559
abstraction

1757
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,040
um yeah i'm just wondering if if you

1758
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,240
have any thoughts about

1759
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,400
where that could go if anywhere yeah so

1760
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,760
so the thing i'll say about that and i'm

1761
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,000
sure

1762
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,160
this is this is uh not uh you know this

1763
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,319
is the kind of thing that's um

1764
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,640
probably uh not not not a lot of people

1765
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,319
will agree with this bit but this is my

1766
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,480
view i to say non-agential

1767
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,280
presupposes that you can draw a binary

1768
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,400
sharp line

1769
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,480
right and between things that are agents

1770
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,680
and things that are not

1771
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,240
i don't really believe in that i think

1772
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,960
that's a

1773
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,880
view that gets us into a lot of trouble

1774
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
by looking at these support looking for

1775
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,920
these sharp lines

1776
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,200
i think that all there is is a degree of

1777
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,960
agency and i'm not sure we are we talked

1778
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,079
about yesterday whether there's such a

1779
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,760
thing as zero i i don't actually i'm not

1780
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,960
even sure there's a zero but but

1781
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,760
certainly there are

1782
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,319
there are things that are very very sort

1783
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:08,960
of

1784
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,040
non you know very very low levels of

1785
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,319
agency and

1786
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,680
and things that are very high and

1787
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,160
everything is a smooth continuum so now

1788
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,000
then so so then then then the question

1789
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,960
is okay so what do you do with

1790
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,319
hurricanes and things like this

1791
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,599
so i drew um and this will be this you

1792
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,280
know in the next uh in the next

1793
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,720
paper there's a thing there's a thing

1794
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,480
that i call um it's an axis of

1795
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,599
persuadability

1796
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,440
it's it and it's it's so it's sort of

1797
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,520
related to um dennis intentional scenes

1798
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,799
in the following way

1799
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,040
there's a there's a there's a continuum

1800
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,839
and

1801
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,000
for any given system so so my claim is

1802
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,680
that it's an empirical problem you can't

1803
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,359
say whether something is or is not an

1804
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,880
agent lots of people do they'll say well

1805
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,680
that's not image

1806
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,319
i think you you can't say that um until

1807
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,599
you've done the empirical work and the

1808
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,839
empirical work looks like this

1809
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,760
all the way the the question is this as

1810
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,119
an engineer this is very

1811
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,960
much an engineering perspective as an

1812
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,559
engineer how much

1813
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,520
work do you have to do uh what do you

1814
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,359
need to know about the system

1815
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,839
and what kind of work do you have to do

1816
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,520
to be able to control

1817
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
and predict its outcome so i'll just

1818
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,880
give you a couple of examples

1819
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,799
all the way on the left you have things

1820
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,400
that are like mechanical clocks

1821
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,680
so if you're dealing with a system

1822
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,520
that's like a mechanical clock

1823
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,200
you know you can put it on the left of

1824
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,799
this of this diagram

1825
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,680
because you are not going to uh reason

1826
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,040
with it you are not going to

1827
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,240
train it you're not going to be able to

1828
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,760
punish it you're not going to be able to

1829
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,480
rewrite

1830
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,359
it it's it's you know goal states you

1831
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,400
have to you have to know

1832
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,079
how it works and you have to micromanage

1833
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,240
the hardware and you have to make um

1834
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,200
uh you have to rewire the the the

1835
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,880
physics of it to get it to do something

1836
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,000
else okay

1837
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,280
then moving on from that you have

1838
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,040
something like a thermostat and with a

1839
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,960
thermostat you're also not going to

1840
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,200
reason or punt it with it or punish it

1841
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,599
but there is a separate set point and if

1842
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,280
you want the room to be kept in a

1843
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,000
different temperature

1844
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,599
range you don't have to rewire the

1845
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,680
thermostat you can change the set point

1846
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,440
so as and this has massive implications

1847
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,960
for regenerative medicine that we can we

1848
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,160
can talk about

1849
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,880
the way you relate to the system is is

1850
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,680
quite a bit

1851
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,160
different now after that you might get

1852
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,920
to systems that have

1853
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,599
preferences in the sense that you can

1854
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,040
actually train them meaning

1855
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,680
you can provide rewards and punishments

1856
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,720
they will

1857
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,760
change their behavior because what

1858
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,440
you're doing is you're relying on them

1859
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,079
to be a

1860
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,000
kind of learning system they're able to

1861
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,200
do associative learning so they

1862
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,000
associate

1863
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,160
certain things you've done to them with

1864
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,760
us you know with things that they did

1865
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,400
and they will

1866
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,319
change their behavior so now this means

1867
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,880
that we can now think of what this means

1868
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,200
you know

1869
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,240
humanity has been training animals

1870
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,000
for i don't know ten thousand years

1871
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,680
whatever uh with knowing nothing about

1872
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,559
neuroscience

1873
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,240
it means that you don't actually have to

1874
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,920
know what's going on inside your system

1875
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,520
you don't need that micro level

1876
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,000
hardware information what you all you

1877
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,559
need

1878
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,359
is uh to to know that that animal that

1879
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:53,680
that

1880
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,480
uh system is actually a that it has that

1881
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,920
level of agency that it's

1882
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,480
susceptible to this kind of um

1883
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,200
interaction

1884
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,119
and how do you know you don't know until

1885
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,720
you've tried so we have no idea so one

1886
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,359
of the things

1887
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,960
we're doing now with charles abramson

1888
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,000
who's a behaviorist

1889
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,359
scientist we're right we're actually

1890
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,040
writing a how-to um

1891
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,079
manual you know how-to uh paper

1892
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,559
on if you are given some sort of weird a

1893
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,640
new synthetic system how do you know

1894
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,599
where along the

1895
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,119
and there's actually has a bunch of a

1896
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,559
bunch of experiments that you do to

1897
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:25,440
figure out where

1898
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
you are along this this path so you can

1899
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,559
go further

1900
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,880
and and there are other systems where

1901
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,160
you know nothing about

1902
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,640
um what's inside and in fact the amount

1903
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,520
of energy that

1904
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,119
it takes to manipulate them is tiny

1905
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,400
because you can you can give them

1906
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,920
reasons as opposed to causes

1907
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,880
and you can you can give them

1908
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,640
information and they will act on this

1909
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,000
information and do various things

1910
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,280
this is sophisticated um agents

1911
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,559
so all that is to say uh the question of

1912
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,040
where

1913
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,760
something like a hurricane lands on this

1914
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,119
on this on the spectrum

1915
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,119
i think we need to really resist the

1916
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,040
urge to just make pronouncements you

1917
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,400
know sort of armchair pronouncements

1918
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:00,960
about that

1919
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,359
and we need to ask a simple question

1920
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,520
which type of manipulation

1921
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,079
is that system amenable to and when you

1922
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:08,720
find out

1923
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,799
then you know how much agency it has now

1924
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,440
give you a simple example of

1925
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,000
how this works we and other people have

1926
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,760
done something similar

1927
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,119
if you think about gene regulatory

1928
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,119
networks so gene regulatory networks are

1929
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,599
a

1930
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,240
quintessential example of a you know

1931
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,319
dynamical system it's it's

1932
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,559
deterministic and all that and one of

1933
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,920
the things we asked is we

1934
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,119
we we simply said how do we know where

1935
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,440
on this spectrum it lands let's just try

1936
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,480
to train it

1937
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,799
and see what happens and it turns out

1938
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:39,920
and this is so we did this

1939
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,599
computationally and now

1940
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,200
we're sort of starting to do this at the

1941
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,760
bench we simply ask the question could

1942
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,960
gene regulatory networks have

1943
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,799
associative learning capacity

1944
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,079
and that means that you could do

1945
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,680
interesting things you can do pavlov

1946
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,559
dogs

1947
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,640
experiment so you have a gene regulatory

1948
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,599
network

1949
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,760
you have some uh stimulus that causes it

1950
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,960
to do something so you have your

1951
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,480
unconditioned stimulus that causes the

1952
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,440
response

1953
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,280
you have this other thing that's a

1954
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,640
that's a

1955
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,160
neutral stimulus that normally doesn't

1956
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,920
do anything uh

1957
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,040
you pair presentations of the the

1958
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,119
ucs and them and the neutral stimulus

1959
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,040
together and after a while what you

1960
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,760
might find

1961
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,599
is that now take away the the original

1962
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,440
unconditioned stimulus and use the

1963
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,799
neutral stimulus and that's now enough

1964
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,240
to trigger the response because there's

1965
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,000
an associative memory that formed

1966
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
in the network right so now we actually

1967
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,760
tried this in the sense that we we took

1968
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,119
a bunch of um

1969
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,720
known gene regulatory networks from the

1970
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,040
literature we made an algorithm that

1971
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,119
basically checks for associative

1972
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,040
learning and lo and behold we found two

1973
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,319
things we found that

1974
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,319
there are six different kinds of

1975
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,920
memories that these things can do

1976
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,760
including associated memories from any

1977
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,960
of them and

1978
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,280
that the biological networks have way

1979
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,680
more memories than you find in random

1980
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,200
random networks that you you know you

1981
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,480
would just randomly concoct so

1982
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,200
apparently

1983
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,799
either directly or indirectly selection

1984
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,200
likes that so that's just an example

1985
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,039
of uh what you would do under this view

1986
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,000
with with dynamical systems right that

1987
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,440
that you would think oh you know these

1988
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,119
are trouble cases are they agents or

1989
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:09,599
aren't they

1990
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,039
i think that's why we get in trouble

1991
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,559
because we try to draw a sharp line i

1992
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,520
think the answer is

1993
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,880
there's somewhere on the line they could

1994
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,680
be way over on the left or not

1995
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,520
and you find out when you figure out

1996
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,599
what kind of

1997
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,319
intervention and strategy avails you of

1998
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,000
the most predictive power with the least

1999
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,720
amount of effort

2000
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,799
nice so we talked yesterday kind of

2001
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:33,520
about

2002
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,799
um you know cells that are contiguous

2003
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,319
and there's like connections and so this

2004
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,079
this concept of like a shared

2005
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,079
information making up

2006
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,960
uh an individual or like what consists

2007
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,200
like constitutes the boundary

2008
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,079
you know if if cells are connected via

2009
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,359
gap junctions and like

2010
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,960
you talked about how if there's a

2011
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,680
calcium molecule inside my cell

2012
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,000
i don't know if it's from from me or

2013
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
from my neighbor because we share this

2014
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,480
kind of

2015
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,599
hole between us and so i just wonder if

2016
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,400
if there's some

2017
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,559
degree of information sharing or some

2018
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,240
kind of like proximal

2019
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,240
like level does it have to be

2020
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,599
immediately contiguous

2021
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,760
to you know have that same like

2022
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,200
cognitive capacity or

2023
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,680
or like over a longer distance can this

2024
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,640
also function

2025
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,720
like for example if i get some kind of

2026
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,000
like necrotizing

2027
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,200
flesh in my leg is my toe

2028
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,000
necessarily gonna know like what's going

2029
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,079
on with my leg it's gonna take a while

2030
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,920
for that signal to diffuse over such a

2031
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,599
long distance so

2032
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,920
so where is the like the boundary or

2033
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,520
container space

2034
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,000
for this kind of information sharing

2035
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,200
that has to occur

2036
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,440
to make this cognitive cognitive

2037
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,480
individual

2038
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,520
like a whole the whole thing by itself

2039
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,200
so i don't know if you can say a little

2040
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:58,319
bit more about that

2041
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,920
yeah yeah um the biggest is so so i

2042
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,359
think so i think one thing that i really

2043
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,559
need to improve

2044
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,119
in this whole thing for next time is a

2045
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,640
better visualization and i

2046
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
frankly don't yet know how to do it

2047
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,359
because this this way of visualizing it

2048
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,079
looks very

2049
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,880
physical it looks like what the cone is

2050
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
is it that the cone is at the edge of

2051
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,319
the cells that are connected right it

2052
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:20,799
sort of

2053
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,160
gives this idea that what you're

2054
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,599
measuring is the actual physical

2055
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,960
boundary of the system

2056
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,799
and that's not quite what i'm trying to

2057
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,480
get across because

2058
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,640
what what and and this is actually let's

2059
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,760
just think about the cells

2060
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,720
in in the in the um cancer versus

2061
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,319
multicellularity right which is a nice

2062
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,039
example of

2063
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,160
how this works when you have a bunch of

2064
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,039
cells

2065
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,280
and they get together and they're going

2066
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,119
to build a kidney

2067
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,400
the um the size of

2068
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,440
the at least the spatial size of that of

2069
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,480
of that particular agent is going to be

2070
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,240
roughly the size of the thing they're

2071
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,599
working towards it's going to be the

2072
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,960
size of that kidney right that's the

2073
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,480
project they're all working on

2074
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,480
um each individual cell has no idea what

2075
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,680
a kidney is but the collective

2076
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,520
intelligence of that group of cells

2077
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,559
it has a uh a goal that's trying to

2078
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,920
build my kidney if you try to deviate it

2079
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,839
from that goal it will do its best to

2080
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,359
get back and do it anyway

2081
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,599
um so what you would be measuring there

2082
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,480
is

2083
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,400
the uh the size of the of the state that

2084
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
it's trying to achieve not necessarily

2085
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,640
this you know where the edges of the of

2086
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,839
the now there's certainly some

2087
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,200
relationship there because in this

2088
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,240
particular example

2089
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,920
what an a as you said what enables the

2090
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,680
cells to work together is the fact that

2091
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,440
they're electrically coupled into one

2092
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,839
and chemically coupled into one giant

2093
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,359
network so so there's some relationship

2094
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,520
but it's not quite always the edge

2095
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,200
right you know what i mean and and the

2096
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,520
same thing with the individual cells

2097
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,359
um there's a it's it's there's it's

2098
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,880
related but it's not exactly the same

2099
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,400
thing when one cell

2100
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,400
defect so let's say an oncogene turns on

2101
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,319
the cell closes all the gap junctions

2102
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,760
disconnects from its neighbors

2103
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,559
and now that computational boundary is

2104
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,559
literally just that one cell

2105
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,039
again it's not quite at the edge of the

2106
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,359
cell because if you look at

2107
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,119
the scale of things the cell is trying

2108
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,200
to manage it's a little bit bigger than

2109
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,520
that because it also really cares about

2110
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,319
um some of the you know the the

2111
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,079
nutrients the wastes the the con

2112
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:14,960
specifics the

2113
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,720
the prey whatever else is going on right

2114
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,000
at that edge right so it's not

2115
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,640
quite at the cell boundary so i i just

2116
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,920
want to make that clear that this

2117
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,480
diagram

2118
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,520
isn't meant to be an anatomical uh

2119
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,640
the cone isn't meant to be a map exactly

2120
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,160
on the anatomy it's a cone of

2121
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,760
the states that the thing is trying to

2122
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,559
actively manage

2123
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,640
yeah i think that the cones were

2124
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,598
inflicted by us though

2125
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,160
yeah but but you're absolutely right and

2126
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,839
as soon as you did that i realized that

2127
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,839
what would be good because that has to

2128
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,520
be right those two diagrams eventually

2129
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,160
have to meet

2130
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,319
right and so there have to be there

2131
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,599
there has to be a way to

2132
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,640
so i think i don't know my visual um

2133
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,480
imagination isn't great i have to think

2134
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,160
a little bit more about a better way to

2135
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,599
to kind of represent it but

2136
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,799
of course you're right those two things

2137
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,599
have to come together

2138
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,880
yes stephen yeah i was just

2139
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,160
so following on from what you were

2140
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,920
saying is

2141
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,400
often as well as useful when we think of

2142
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,240
entities and processes

2143
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,079
i'm maybe scaling up to more

2144
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,240
psychological scales but

2145
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,559
you know we often think about this is

2146
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,680
this person this is

2147
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,599
what this entity is diagnosed as and

2148
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,799
this entity and

2149
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,119
it's all kind of and and there's a lot

2150
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,319
more now move towards

2151
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,160
what's the process but then what kind of

2152
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,520
processes do we have

2153
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,200
on that continuum just like we're

2154
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,960
talking about with the hurricane you

2155
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,520
know

2156
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,039
you maybe you've got a static entity

2157
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,039
like a rock and then you've got your

2158
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,799
kind of systems some of which could be

2159
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,119
mechanical like a clock

2160
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,520
but then you sort of hit structures

2161
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,520
there's some sort of structure

2162
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,079
like a i don't know like a skeleton or a

2163
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,200
network of processes coming together

2164
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,640
then you get into them which is what i

2165
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,559
find really interesting with

2166
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,920
the work you do is you the sort of

2167
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,760
non-linear swarming

2168
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,480
dynamics you know and it's sort of um

2169
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,799
and i was wondering how

2170
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,160
when you think of th you know you've got

2171
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,559
a body and i'm a body and i'm trying to

2172
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,599
work in my space around me so i see

2173
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,599
things in my environment out there

2174
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,000
and i can interact to some extent

2175
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,520
depending on what my

2176
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,719
available processes afford me in my

2177
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,839
structures

2178
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,679
and then there's other stuff inside

2179
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,759
which to some extent i kind of have to

2180
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,238
let

2181
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,759
take care of themselves unless i want to

2182
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,319
tattoo myself or do some sort of

2183
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,920
internal

2184
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,399
mutilation or something i'm curious

2185
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:36,960
about

2186
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,560
how this entity process

2187
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,080
dynamic going in and out can be

2188
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,279
thought of yeah um well i want to say a

2189
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,158
couple of things

2190
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:51,600
uh and again this is you know sort of

2191
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,759
going going kind of far a stream but i

2192
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,359
think i think it might be relevant

2193
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,679
um when you say you are this body

2194
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,359
sort of in the sense that we are talking

2195
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,198
to the verbal

2196
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:05,520
entity there but there are all sorts of

2197
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,880
other entities there that we're not

2198
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,920
hearing from that

2199
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,080
that and so so we know that from split

2200
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,759
brain patients right we know that

2201
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,238
um after a commissurotomy the right side

2202
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,359
of the brain

2203
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,880
you can communicate with it it'll give

2204
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,399
you opinions that uh

2205
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,960
the verbal patient part of the patient

2206
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,238
doesn't agree with doesn't know anything

2207
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:22,960
about right so

2208
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,719
it's really really interesting um i also

2209
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,880
think about uh multiple personality you

2210
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,920
know they call it

2211
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,080
multiple personality disorder but but

2212
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,520
but the reality is

2213
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,679
you know a single a single brain body

2214
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,520
system apparently can

2215
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,719
post any number of distinct and how

2216
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,560
in how i am i'm not a i'm not an expert

2217
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,759
in this area i don't know how

2218
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,439
psychologically deep so some of these

2219
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,279
other personalities go but enough that

2220
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,560
you can have a conversation certainly

2221
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,920
enough that you can have a conversation

2222
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,479
with them

2223
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,000
which means they're doing better than

2224
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,320
all of the ai that we've ever produced

2225
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,360
right and and they uh and in fact i i

2226
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,719
read once i forget where it was but

2227
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,000
there was an interesting comment

2228
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,520
from a a a therapist

2229
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,320
who was asked to he was he was he was

2230
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,040
asked to deal with

2231
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,679
with a multiple personality patient and

2232
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,880
he was talking about

2233
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,360
integration and he was you know that the

2234
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,719
goal of the therapy was going to

2235
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,080
integrate because of course it's very

2236
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,520
disruptive for the for the individual

2237
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,960
and we're gonna we're gonna integrate

2238
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,320
all of these into one

2239
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,480
and one of the personalities said to

2240
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,520
that patient

2241
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,679
integration you you're gonna kill me

2242
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:28,880
right that's what you're talking about i

2243
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,920
thought you were a doctor what are we

2244
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,800
talking about here

2245
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,960
and so you know it was outraged that

2246
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,920
that there was going to be this

2247
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,199
integration of

2248
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,400
you know of of of what at least uh

2249
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,800
ostensibly uh you've got this entity

2250
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,400
that certainly passes the turing test

2251
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,679
and is

2252
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:44,960
is not happy about the fact that you're

2253
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
about to integrate it in you know away

2254
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,000
basically right

2255
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,640
so that's you know i think that goes

2256
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,360
back to

2257
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,920
this idea that we're an interpenetrating

2258
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,560
set of

2259
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,199
selves and we tend to only hear from the

2260
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,080
verbal one

2261
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
so there's all kinds of other ones in

2262
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,520
there that are competing and

2263
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,080
and cooperating and everything else and

2264
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,440
and the other thing i can say about this

2265
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,239
so that's more

2266
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,760
questions than the answers i guess but

2267
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,520
but the the other thing i think that's

2268
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,600
interesting is that

2269
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,840
you're you're right in the sense that um

2270
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,520
the one kind of entity that we have

2271
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,040
direct experience with which is the

2272
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,560
verbal you know sort of one that

2273
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,920
presumably we share is completely

2274
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,600
ignorant of most of the things that are

2275
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,320
going on

2276
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,679
there and so the space that you're

2277
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,159
working with nicely coarse grains over

2278
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,679
all kinds of stuff you know your liver

2279
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:30,800
function and everything else you don't

2280
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,159
need to micromanage all this

2281
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,480
however there are techniques that will

2282
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,199
add

2283
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,840
axes to your option space so if you

2284
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,040
would like to learn

2285
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,480
to also consciously control your heart

2286
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,600
rate or your

2287
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,440
skin temperature or whatever you can do

2288
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,360
biofeedback there are tools that will

2289
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,679
enable you to cross that that that

2290
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,480
boundary

2291
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,480
and you will now have a new axis in your

2292
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,080
option space that you never did had

2293
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,640
before

2294
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,320
do you want it i don't know there's a

2295
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,080
good reason why most of these you don't

2296
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,199
you don't use it's as

2297
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,159
good to sort of simplify your space but

2298
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,600
but you know there was a there was an

2299
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,520
it was a cool experiment where they uh

2300
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,280
they measured the temperature between a

2301
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:07,679
rat's

2302
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,679
ears and they gave it a reward

2303
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,440
proportional to the difference

2304
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,159
in uh in temperature and so rats readily

2305
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,760
learned to to get their ears to you know

2306
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,280
i think like five degrees celsius or

2307
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,480
something different between their ears

2308
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,520
to get the reward right

2309
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,239
so now that's amazing for a number of

2310
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,679
reasons one is that okay now

2311
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,960
now you've added uh an effector in your

2312
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,600
space

2313
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,600
that is is you know kind of this

2314
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,960
physiological blood flow i don't know

2315
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,520
how

2316
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,040
they do it um that you didn't have

2317
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,320
before the other thing of course is the

2318
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,280
credit assignment

2319
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,880
you know here you are you're a rat and

2320
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,960
you just got some reward and so

2321
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,400
well let me see why did i get this so

2322
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,000
well my tail is pointing

2323
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
up and my left you know fingers are

2324
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,520
clenched and my whiskers are going which

2325
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,960
of those things actually worries

2326
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,520
right so so this is we still haven't

2327
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,000
cracked this

2328
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,840
in machine learning is how how living

2329
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,520
things are so good at figuring out what

2330
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,360
exactly they're being rewarded for small

2331
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,719
number of trials actually

2332
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,840
so but you can i think i think you can

2333
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,920
break through at least to some extent

2334
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,280
and you know break through

2335
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,880
and actually even further right so there

2336
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,920
are claims that certain types of um

2337
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,000
you know mental practices will have

2338
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,440
effects on your immune system for

2339
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,000
example

2340
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,880
right so you can i think you can go

2341
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,360
pretty

2342
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,440
far down right from if you wanted to add

2343
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,800
these these kinds of things to your

2344
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,880
option space

2345
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,360
ah interesting actually just bouncing on

2346
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,400
that going

2347
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,920
that's really helpful actually i've not

2348
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,679
even thought about that but that

2349
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,239
that different parts of us ties in with

2350
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,920
there's this big push all the time if

2351
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,600
you say about integrate integrate

2352
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,400
integrate

2353
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,159
and actually scale out because i do a

2354
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,400
lot of work with multi-service

2355
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,800
um service providers say in africa or

2356
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,320
other countries where they're

2357
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,360
and you tend to find that any type of

2358
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,679
um transdisciplinary project has the

2359
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,440
problem about whichever regime of

2360
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,440
attention or field of practice

2361
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,640
the voice is in at that time and then

2362
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,400
then when we talk about integrating but

2363
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,080
it normally means

2364
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,199
they dominate and what about configuring

2365
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,040
so think about this idea of configuring

2366
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,800
different fields of practice by

2367
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,000
different ways or different ways of

2368
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,760
knowing and also

2369
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,679
ways the other voices is strategic

2370
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,760
conversations with communities who don't

2371
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,880
normally get a voice

2372
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,360
who knows something in the state space

2373
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,800
beyond what

2374
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,960
the the actors who've got the job in the

2375
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,400
agency know

2376
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,960
and it's this sort of ties in a little

2377
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,560
bit with what you're talking about here

2378
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,760
so i think it's quite interesting in the

2379
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,400
sense of

2380
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,880
can we conf because in a way the biology

2381
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,199
isn't trying to integrate

2382
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,600
it's actually configuring and allowing

2383
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,840
things to be but it has a way to still

2384
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,480
know

2385
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,719
their different teleological spaces and

2386
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,600
either just let it get on with it or

2387
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:47,920
yeah

2388
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,840
knows where and when to get involved i

2389
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
suppose is is the thing

2390
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,040
yeah i mean so so so i think i think the

2391
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,400
the one way of looking at that is to

2392
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,920
is to ask what are the optimal policies

2393
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,120
for uh for this binding so so i'll just

2394
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,320
you know i'll give you an example so in

2395
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,040
the case of in the case of the um

2396
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,600
multicellularity we say

2397
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,800
okay uh individual cells are pretty cool

2398
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,239
but when they connect via gap junctions

2399
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,040
into a multi-cellular collective they

2400
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,640
can do these these marvelous things and

2401
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,239
they resist cancer and

2402
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,000
you know and and turning off the

2403
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,640
connection and becoming met you know um

2404
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,920
becoming a cancer cell and going

2405
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,080
metastatic is is bad and so what you

2406
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,120
would really like to do

2407
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,440
is is to reconnect these cells back in

2408
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,560
so the thing is

2409
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,920
that right that that tightly coupling

2410
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,120
individual units into a global entity

2411
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,800
avails you of all kinds of interesting

2412
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,480
things right so it raises the iq of the

2413
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,600
whole and gives you all kinds of

2414
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,400
capabilities

2415
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,960
fine but one of the things that gets

2416
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,480
lost when you do that

2417
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,760
is uh that the larger system now now can

2418
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,480
dominate

2419
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,880
the the goals of the lower system and in

2420
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,600
fact the larger system may have

2421
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,719
very little uh care for the goals of the

2422
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,080
welfare of the subunit

2423
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,360
you know when was the last time you

2424
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,719
worried about all the skin cells you're

2425
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,640
shedding right you just you you know

2426
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,840
you're gonna do what you're gonna do and

2427
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,360
if you lose some skin cells you know no

2428
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,480
no no problem

2429
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,679
um so what that suggests is that

2430
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,360
blood you know maximum maximizing out

2431
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,760
this connectivity into some giant borg

2432
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,199
like uh you know thing

2433
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,280
is is an and obviously it's been you

2434
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,719
know it's kind of been attempted on you

2435
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:27,360
know on the

2436
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,560
on the social scale we know how that

2437
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,120
turns out so you want to

2438
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,360
uh somewhere in between there there's a

2439
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,040
there's an optimal policy

2440
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,520
right where i i hope there may not you

2441
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,280
know there may be some no-go theorem

2442
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:39,520
it's

2443
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,120
somewhere that says there is no good

2444
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,960
policy but i hope

2445
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,400
that somewhere in there there's a good

2446
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,480
policy that allows us to

2447
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,000
uh reap the rewards of appropriate kinds

2448
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,280
of large-scale

2449
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,880
organization without a sort of

2450
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,800
blanket collectivism that that

2451
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,719
completely uh sort of you know wipes out

2452
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,000
the uh

2453
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,840
the needs of the of the lower level

2454
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,600
subunits so

2455
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,719
that i hope is a is an empirical

2456
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,320
question that we should we should be

2457
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,400
looking for what kind of policies give

2458
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,960
us

2459
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,280
that that optimize the various things we

2460
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,239
want to optimize

2461
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,800
um josh vaughn garden i planned a grant

2462
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,600
at one point

2463
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,360
for this human flood this human

2464
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,600
flourishing um program somewhere that i

2465
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,560
think it's actually

2466
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,400
an empirical question can we identify

2467
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,159
the optimal policies that

2468
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,120
preserve the needs of the subunits and

2469
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:29,600
reap

2470
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,320
the rewards of becoming a greater whole

2471
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,520
nice so i learned this word yesterday at

2472
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,320
gregor

2473
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,480
it's the occult concept representing a

2474
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,840
distinct non-physical

2475
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,080
entity that arises from a collective

2476
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,199
group of people

2477
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,120
and i thought it was really cool and and

2478
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,719
i think of this concept of

2479
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,840
emergence so like at what level does

2480
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,960
this collective

2481
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,600
kind of body form and i don't know if

2482
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,880
you've read the information theory of

2483
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,320
individuality paper

2484
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
uh by david krakauer but we really think

2485
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,159
about you know emergence

2486
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,400
you know like the emergence causing the

2487
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,760
formation of the collective

2488
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,520
entity but then there also has to be

2489
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,000
like some kind of downward causation at

2490
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,120
some some point in there like is so is

2491
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:15,440
there

2492
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,199
is this some kind of like critical point

2493
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,960
like a phase transition that starts to

2494
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,520
occur

2495
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,199
or when does that kind of start to

2496
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,960
happen that that bi-directional

2497
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,840
information flow yeah

2498
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,480
for sure i mean i mean th this this in

2499
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,560
particular is is interesting because

2500
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,640
i i i thought about this a little while

2501
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,640
ago that you know especially

2502
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,120
um people who are interested in this

2503
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,400
kind of stuff uh

2504
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,760
you know and you can think about the the

2505
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,080
really old concept of group karma right

2506
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,960
this idea that

2507
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,159
that not only you have your own

2508
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,760
individual cause and effect that you're

2509
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,159
causing but but in a strong sense

2510
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,320
the group of which you are apart has its

2511
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,239
own right cause and effect

2512
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,360
that is that is as real as so so

2513
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,040
that idea and i don't know how many

2514
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,719
thousands of years old that idea is

2515
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,840
i think it is an amazing um amazingly

2516
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,960
prescient because

2517
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,320
in in western science the the you know

2518
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,520
collective intelligence right the

2519
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,760
science of collective intelligence and

2520
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,480
this idea that right the group can be a

2521
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,360
you know a swarm

2522
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,199
of whatever can be an agent on its own

2523
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,040
is relatively recent right that people

2524
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
started taking that seriously in in

2525
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:21,520
science

2526
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,199
but i think i think that kind of

2527
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,960
thinking must have been extremely

2528
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,800
old because there are these traditions

2529
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,719
that take it very seriously

2530
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,440
that the group is not just a heap of

2531
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,000
stuff

2532
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,640
but it actually has its own agency in

2533
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,920
the sense that it can even be the

2534
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,120
subject of blame

2535
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,120
and reward in the sense of you know the

2536
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,960
sense of like rewarding punishment karma

2537
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,520
whatever

2538
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,520
that that that's a very strong view of

2539
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,040
group agency that i think

2540
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,480
we've only said you know scientifically

2541
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,600
we've only really appreciated recently

2542
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,800
so i think that's that's that's pretty

2543
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
cool actually

2544
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,400
random random linguistic thing here that

2545
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,880
gregor i was thinking about egregious

2546
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,760
and like egregious in my mind is like

2547
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,600
out of bounds you know but and yet

2548
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,719
gregor is or is not that it's the

2549
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,320
opposite it's almost like a group

2550
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,159
thing maybe maybe some other somebody

2551
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,440
else can think about that differently

2552
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,280
but i thought that was an interesting

2553
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,320
conflict yeah very interesting

2554
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
so i think about this concept of

2555
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,520
collective karma

2556
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,159
a lot um and really kind of whether or

2557
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:24,800
not

2558
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,199
like i have free will in the in the

2559
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:27,920
present like

2560
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,760
in terms of am i just some kind of

2561
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,520
computation like my

2562
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,560
like you know just because i've been

2563
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
doing active inference and so

2564
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
am i just my generative model that that

2565
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,800
like effectively i can't make any

2566
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,760
decision because

2567
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,920
of of my model like whatever input i'm

2568
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,120
getting at that moment

2569
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,840
i have to decide based on on the the

2570
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,600
condition of my model at that time

2571
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,440
and i think about collective karma much

2572
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,040
in the same way

2573
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,199
um and whether or not there exists some

2574
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,239
kind of of

2575
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,360
agency in the present or or

2576
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,320
not like if all the things that just

2577
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,120
made me who

2578
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,400
i am right now have just led ultimately

2579
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:04,960
to

2580
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,199
to be where i am and and in collective

2581
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,800
karma too it's like a hurricane

2582
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,400
that group of people caused that

2583
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,239
hurricane to happen like they created

2584
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:13,600
the causes for

2585
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,520
the collective karma for the hurricane

2586
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
to come um

2587
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,040
so i don't know it's it's something that

2588
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,199
that is really intriguing to me and

2589
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,239
um you know

2590
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,840
i don't know if you want to maybe

2591
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,080
elaborate a little bit more on that

2592
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,120
yeah yeah and and so and so two thoughts

2593
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:31,679
about that

2594
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,239
uh one one is that this goes back to

2595
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,480
this idea of of spaces and the different

2596
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,320
spaces that each of your um

2597
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,199
each of the subunits is working in one

2598
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,400
way that

2599
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,159
and and after after i drew this cone and

2600
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,440
i realized that it kind of looked like

2601
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:45,760
the

2602
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,840
the the special relativity cone and all

2603
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,120
that uh

2604
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,280
some other some other pieces of

2605
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,320
relativity sort of

2606
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,239
started started popping into my head and

2607
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,760
this idea of

2608
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,000
deforming the space around you right so

2609
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,520
if you're a mass you deform the space

2610
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,800
around you which in turn

2611
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,280
alters your next possible movements and

2612
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,480
the possible movements of the other

2613
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,760
masses around you right

2614
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
so by deforming that by your actions you

2615
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,520
are deforming the possible

2616
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,920
the possibility space for for your for

2617
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,760
yourself for things next to you for your

2618
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,960
components and so on

2619
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,719
and so one thing that i think happens is

2620
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,440
that these larger systems

2621
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,719
deform the action space for their lower

2622
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:23,520
systems

2623
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,920
so that to that so but all they have to

2624
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,199
do is

2625
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,520
roll downhill in effect and so if you

2626
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,239
zoom in

2627
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,440
so this gets back and i'm going to

2628
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,960
connect this back to your your point

2629
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,679
about karma

2630
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,159
and and action and choices and so on

2631
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,440
when you zoom in

2632
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
all you see is physics and you see and

2633
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,880
you say oh well this

2634
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,000
this is yellow of course that's what

2635
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,199
it's doing that's all it could do all

2636
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,320
the gradients are pointing this way

2637
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,600
that's what it had to do

2638
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,080
but the reason it can be it can do that

2639
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,159
is and still get to some global goal is

2640
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,520
because the higher level system has

2641
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,199
already deformed that space

2642
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,639
so i see this and i don't know how i'm

2643
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:55,920
going to ever draw this that's a

2644
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,440
different story but but i see all these

2645
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,560
different levels

2646
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,159
as uh deforming their simpler space that

2647
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,280
they're working in

2648
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,920
which then changes the option space for

2649
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,960
their sub units

2650
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,600
so that they can they don't have to be a

2651
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,320
smart this is

2652
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,679
this is sort of bennett's idea of you

2653
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,280
know progressively dumber robots all the

2654
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,920
way down

2655
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,880
that works if each system makes it so

2656
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,000
that so that the the

2657
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,600
the lower level systems don't have to do

2658
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,120
quite as much of the work and there's a

2659
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,040
stupid example i always go to from from

2660
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:23,679
you know

2661
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,480
from like common everyday life if if if

2662
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,840
you ever had a friend who tried to stop

2663
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,480
smoking

2664
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,679
and they like to smoke at night one of

2665
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:30,880
the things they might do is put their

2666
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,239
car key someone that's really hard to

2667
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:32,800
get to

2668
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,400
why because they know that when they you

2669
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,320
know at midnight when they want to smoke

2670
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,760
they're not going to feel like going

2671
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,120
hunting for the keys and then they could

2672
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,560
find and then that's that so

2673
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,159
so what they're doing is you know who

2674
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,440
are you doing this so you're doing this

2675
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,800
to your future self right you're

2676
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,280
deforming the space for your future self

2677
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,719
in that case consciously and of course

2678
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,400
we all do things unconsciously too

2679
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,679
but in that case you're consciously

2680
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,600
deforming the action space

2681
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,639
for your future self in order to uh so

2682
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,080
that you can be on autopilot at that

2683
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,280
point right you don't have to have the

2684
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,800
willpower at midnight that i'm gonna

2685
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,239
not do this it's you've already

2686
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,600
somebody's already sort of twisted the

2687
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,719
space for you so that

2688
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,320
just going to get your keys is just too

2689
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,159
high of a barrier and then forget it

2690
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:11,120
so uh right so so i think i think that

2691
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,520
that

2692
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,600
that that deformation of these action

2693
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,199
spaces is a really important way in

2694
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,159
which

2695
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,840
um lower and higher level systems relate

2696
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,159
the lower level systems simplify the

2697
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,000
action space for the higher level system

2698
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,440
because they're competent so the higher

2699
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,560
level system doesn't need all the

2700
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,520
dimensions

2701
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,400
and the higher system bends the space of

2702
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,320
the lower system to make things easier

2703
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,120
to get to and that and that goes back to

2704
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,719
your other point that you that you just

2705
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,520
made about

2706
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,440
um in the moment of of of taking actions

2707
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,880
in the moment that are

2708
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,719
the consequence of all the pressures

2709
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,400
that you have set up and other

2710
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,639
things have set up for you where yeah i

2711
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,520
see this as those

2712
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,840
so if we think about will in the sense

2713
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,600
of you know free will or decision making

2714
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,560
or whatever

2715
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,679
i i see this again this like uh

2716
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:00,320
four dimensional block where each one of

2717
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,040
us at any point in time is a slice of it

2718
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,760
and if you zoom in on that one that that

2719
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,400
self-lit

2720
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,840
that exists at that one time slice your

2721
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,120
your uh free will so to speak is

2722
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,199
is limited to none because at that

2723
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,040
moment on the local scale

2724
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,040
you you are going to do whatever the

2725
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,880
local forces have arranged that you're

2726
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,760
going to do right

2727
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,520
and and this is the one like a simple

2728
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,960
example is you know can you control what

2729
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,480
your next thought is going to be

2730
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,840
you really can't your next thought is

2731
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,360
going to be whatever it is so at the

2732
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,920
local

2733
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,719
at the local level when you zoom in you

2734
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:33,520
know

2735
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,000
there's there's no no useful sense of

2736
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,600
freedom there however

2737
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,159
if you zoom out on the long scale what

2738
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,520
you what is true

2739
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,199
i think is that you can take actions

2740
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,719
repeated actions whether they be

2741
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,480
practice or or you know whatever they're

2742
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,040
going to be

2743
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,840
you can take repeated actions that alter

2744
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,320
your

2745
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,040
cognitive causal structure so that over

2746
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,080
time

2747
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,480
you have made changes and so so no you

2748
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,760
can't control the next thought you're

2749
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,719
going to have now

2750
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,480
but you can control what percentage of

2751
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,159
your thoughts are negative or whatever

2752
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,280
whatever it is down down the line right

2753
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,440
so so to me that question of of choice

2754
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,800
and and freedom

2755
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,960
is very much relative to what scale

2756
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,880
you're asking but if you zoom in to the

2757
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,360
to the

2758
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,199
to the lower you know to the to the

2759
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,360
physics and the sort of short time scale

2760
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,560
no i don't think there's any useful

2761
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,239
sense of that but over the long term

2762
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,040
absolutely

2763
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,800
because you can make changes both in

2764
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,719
your environment your own structure

2765
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,400
that will get you to a different place

2766
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,719
thanks uh stephen yeah this is really

2767
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,000
helpful actually to

2768
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,880
hear it thought about this way and just

2769
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,320
as we're saying there about

2770
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,840
this sort of almost transcendental um

2771
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,080
or the the way we often think of things

2772
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,600
being excluded

2773
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,800
egregious as sarah was saying and

2774
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,960
um when we we need to move beyond

2775
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,159
um the inner outer you know there's an

2776
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,440
inner thought process and there's an

2777
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,360
outer world but the two are linked like

2778
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,360
we say so with active inference

2779
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,600
the idea is that i don't necessarily

2780
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,960
purely have a model

2781
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,080
of those cones in my head i i

2782
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,800
i've got an action model for how to draw

2783
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,920
them

2784
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,679
i haven't got the whole thing that can

2785
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,679
be dumped down like a data source but i

2786
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:18,719
have a way to

2787
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,360
do that which sort of ties in and i was

2788
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:21,920
one and

2789
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,800
when you mentioned there about looking

2790
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,320
at the future

2791
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,080
one thing that adds that active

2792
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,920
inference hasn't really done is it

2793
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,800
talks about say the car keys example is

2794
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,280
is

2795
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,440
is the sequence at which something might

2796
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,600
have to happen to get to the future

2797
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,440
being disrupted which is kind of that

2798
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,360
quantum contextuality

2799
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,440
idea whereas normally in active

2800
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,840
influence they talk about the

2801
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,080
niche construction or the niche

2802
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,480
modification but

2803
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,040
it's not just about modifying itself

2804
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,159
it's modifying

2805
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,920
the trajectories you might take through

2806
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,360
that niche

2807
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,840
which that that gives you more near

2808
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,199
time possibilities for like sculpting

2809
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,960
what can happen when it can happen so

2810
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,560
that i think that's quite

2811
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,159
useful i was wondering how how you see

2812
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,840
that relationship to niche construction

2813
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,719
and

2814
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,080
weather and models being sort of

2815
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,280
embedded in the world i.e so if systems

2816
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,440
are really models in the world

2817
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,639
that we then read or interact with and

2818
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,639
using our structures how do we

2819
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,840
how do we link up that kind of cone with

2820
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,639
the kind of

2821
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,719
niche construction that's maybe being

2822
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,159
used in other areas of active imprints

2823
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,800
yeah i mean so that's that's a very

2824
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,520
difficult

2825
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
question i can sort of address a small

2826
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,199
part of it i think at this point

2827
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,600
and i can j you know i think i think one

2828
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,159
of the key

2829
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,840
questions of all of this is to what

2830
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,080
extent

2831
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,920
when we look at systems and we see the

2832
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,360
dimensions with

2833
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,679
let's just do the third person case

2834
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:02,800
first and then we'll

2835
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,320
talk about that i think the first person

2836
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,920
case that you're talking about so when

2837
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,280
we look at a system

2838
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,719
and we make a map of its its problem

2839
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,400
solving in some space and its goal

2840
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,400
directed activity in some space

2841
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,320
the question is uh is that in any sense

2842
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,719
objective in the meaning meaning could

2843
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,080
we um

2844
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,159
could we make a case that that that

2845
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,360
model of that space

2846
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,800
is better or the best or is

2847
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,800
uh is there an infinity of ways to look

2848
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,639
at it and in particular

2849
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,480
how does that relate to now the first

2850
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,040
person perspective of that that system

2851
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,239
itself

2852
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,239
what does the space look like it's it's

2853
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,600
a little bit like um

2854
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,080
you know the the the whole um belt thing

2855
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:44,639
right where

2856
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,000
you're sort of in some space what does

2857
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,840
it look like to you and

2858
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,080
chris fields made a really nice example

2859
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,440
uh in our um

2860
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,040
computational meeting a couple weeks ago

2861
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,719
where you said imagine

2862
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,040
imagine a bacterium and there's some

2863
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,920
sugar gradient

2864
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,840
that that the bacterium is in and it's

2865
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,000
you know it wants to have more energy

2866
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,400
so now one thing we are tempted to do is

2867
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,120
to draw

2868
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,320
a space where by rotating its flagella

2869
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,360
and whatever else

2870
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,960
this thing is going to move up the

2871
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,639
gradient but there's something else it

2872
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,639
can do which is that it can turn on a

2873
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,560
gene for an enzyme that lets it use

2874
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,120
a completely different sugar or let it

2875
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,000
use that sugar

2876
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
better or something else that solves

2877
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,040
that same problem

2878
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,040
with an effector that to us is an

2879
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,400
entirely different space

2880
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,480
so so so we look at this and we say ah

2881
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,800
that solution has a problem in um in

2882
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,400
physical space and it has a solution in

2883
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
transcriptional space if you're a

2884
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,360
bacterium

2885
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,120
is there any sense in which those are

2886
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,199
not part of the same space i mean i have

2887
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,719
no idea what it's right obviously what

2888
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:42,400
it's like to be that bacterium

2889
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,719
one could make an argument that our

2890
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,560
dissection of these things has two

2891
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,080
different spaces

2892
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,280
is is totally biased because that's

2893
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,719
where scientists and we like to look at

2894
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,639
things that to the bacterium both of

2895
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:55,040
those

2896
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,360
are effectors that live together that's

2897
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,320
kind of a mix

2898
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,080
it's almost like um you know it's almost

2899
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,000
like you you can ask about uh

2900
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,920
some sort of pca right if you're a

2901
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,760
principal component analysis where

2902
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,600
you're learning about your world and

2903
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,199
you're going to end up with a picture of

2904
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,400
what the axes are

2905
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,960
that don't necessarily make any sense to

2906
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,480
us looking at the system right

2907
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,920
you find you get you get these

2908
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,520
components that you know these control

2909
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,480
knobs and we look at

2910
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,600
what the hell is the you know what is it

2911
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,000
doing well but but but but to the system

2912
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,920
those are efficient

2913
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,639
ways to build an axis and people like um

2914
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,120
you know robert brittner and don hoffman

2915
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,000
have these models of these cognitive

2916
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,679
systems from scratch sort of

2917
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,239
building these worlds to these virtual

2918
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,679
spaces for themselves right

2919
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,360
that you don't actually know what spaces

2920
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,120
you're in so

2921
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,280
um i think there's a research agenda

2922
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,880
there which is

2923
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,560
can we build some sort of appliance

2924
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,239
meaning some sort of i don't know

2925
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,000
machine learning thing or something

2926
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,040
that will try to extract these

2927
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,040
in a i'm not going to say unbiased but

2928
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,800
at least unsupervised manner

2929
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,880
that can we build an agency detector can

2930
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,400
we build something that looks at a

2931
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:02,960
system

2932
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,760
and says i tell you what if you assume

2933
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,159
this

2934
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,719
axis this axis and this axis then i can

2935
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:09,920
paint you a really

2936
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,040
uh efficient uh search strategy that

2937
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,400
will allow you to predict

2938
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,239
what the system is going to do next

2939
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,920
because we can view this as problem

2940
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,199
solving in this space

2941
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,600
right and maybe and maybe it generates a

2942
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,120
palette of um

2943
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,960
solutions like that and there's one

2944
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,000
that's head and shoulders above the

2945
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,120
others and you say fine that's my

2946
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,560
scientific theory of what's going on

2947
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,199
here

2948
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,440
and and maybe right and maybe that works

2949
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,719
i don't know so so that's that's

2950
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,880
that's a research kind of agenda for the

2951
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,080
future and

2952
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,960
the other cool thing about that is if

2953
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,360
you

2954
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,360
if you do that of course one thing you

2955
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,960
might want to do is then

2956
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,159
build a more sophisticated

2957
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,719
uh synthetic intelligence by sticking

2958
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:49,760
that thing

2959
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,280
basically closing the loop and sticking

2960
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,000
that that module inside the agent itself

2961
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,400
and here's why i'm saying that all

2962
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,280
animals

2963
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,679
i think uh you know at least past a

2964
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,600
certain point

2965
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,520
certainly have agency detectors this is

2966
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,199
why we love our visual systems love

2967
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,560
symmetry and so on because

2968
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,239
you really want to know looking out into

2969
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,080
the world you really want to know

2970
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,920
what are the passive elements and what

2971
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,120
are the other agents

2972
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,560
that might eat you that you might

2973
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,080
communicate with that you might convince

2974
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,520
them to do something else

2975
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,560
so so we are constantly estimating

2976
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,159
um you know theory of mind right an

2977
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,520
agency for all the things we're looking

2978
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:23,840
at

2979
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,120
because because that helps you get

2980
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,360
around you you need to know if

2981
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,719
if it's if it's a rock or if it's

2982
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:29,679
something that's just going to come eat

2983
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,199
you no matter what or if it's a con

2984
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,120
specific that you might actually lie to

2985
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,960
and or or you don't have a relationship

2986
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,159
whatever you're going to do some sort of

2987
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,120
complicated

2988
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,800
interaction right so we're all we're all

2989
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,120
trying to gauge that and

2990
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,080
probably where what what what one of the

2991
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,280
things that kind of module

2992
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,719
also does is turn inwards to tell you

2993
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,159
stories about yourself

2994
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,000
and the reason we know that exists is

2995
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,600
because of confabulation

2996
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,840
so just as a simple example as this is

2997
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,719
the modern there

2998
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,320
there are older examples from the brain

2999
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,760
split brain studies but the modern

3000
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,400
example

3001
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,920
there's um there's somebody who's got an

3002
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,520
electrode and this was an actual

3003
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,000
experiment

3004
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,920
that was done he had epilepsy or

3005
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,040
something and they put an electrode in

3006
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,320
their brain and in his brain and it

3007
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:08,880
didn't

3008
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,639
happen to land in an area that when you

3009
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,960
stimulate it it stimulates laughter

3010
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,880
the person just starts laughing right so

3011
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,480
so so you're sitting there so this this

3012
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,080
person is sitting there talking to

3013
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,520
you know having a serious conversation

3014
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,120
with the doctor somebody off scene

3015
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,960
pushes the button person starts laughing

3016
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,480
the doctor says to him why are you

3017
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,800
laughing zero percent of the time

3018
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,560
the answer is geez i don't know that was

3019
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,080
super weird i was all serious and

3020
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,600
suddenly my mouth starts laughing that

3021
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,159
never happens what happens is the person

3022
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:34,639
says

3023
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,800
oh i came up with a funny story and i

3024
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,920
was just thinking of a funny thing that

3025
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:38,320
happened

3026
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,880
right so what happens is and this has

3027
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,159
been you know i'm not the first person

3028
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,119
to point this out

3029
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:46,480
that we are massively unaware

3030
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,719
of lots of stuff that goes on in there

3031
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,719
and we have a module apparently

3032
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:53,119
whose job it is to tell coherent stories

3033
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,280
about what that all adds up to

3034
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,159
so not not just turning outwards to see

3035
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,119
what kind of

3036
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,280
agents we see out there but actually to

3037
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,280
look inwards and come up with plausible

3038
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,719
explanations that no you're not an

3039
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,239
automaton because somebody pushed a

3040
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:06,880
button

3041
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,560
that's not that that's not a preferred

3042
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,480
explanation the preferred explanation is

3043
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,920
you're an agent you come up with funny

3044
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,119
stories and sometimes they made you

3045
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:14,560
laugh that's a better explanation

3046
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,600
so um so so we have this so so if we had

3047
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,199
such a thing we could imagine already

3048
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:20,480
piece by piece

3049
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,360
uh starting to put this together into

3050
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:23,920
what

3051
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,239
might be a fairly sophisticated

3052
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,520
cognitive system that has a bit of

3053
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,040
metacognition and a bit of

3054
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,119
uh much like all of us uh sort of faulty

3055
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:36,000
access to what it is that we're doing

3056
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,600
and and all these kind of interesting

3057
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,840
things

3058
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,760
nice so i'm going to kind of take it

3059
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,800
back to this

3060
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,080
um time space cube because i just

3061
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,880
really can't wrap my mind around the

3062
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,800
fact that if you slice up the cube i

3063
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,040
think about it like a like a confocal

3064
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,199
z stack so if you have a slice that's

3065
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,119
the present

3066
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,360
if i can't change this slice like you

3067
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,719
know you can take a projection

3068
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,080
of the confocal image and look at the

3069
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,760
whole picture if i can't change this one

3070
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,800
slice

3071
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,800
how is it that i'm going to change the

3072
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,040
future right so all the slices up until

3073
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:11,840
this point

3074
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,920
lead me to make this current existing

3075
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,760
slice and then

3076
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,679
it do i can i change any point in the

3077
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,360
future i don't see how that's possible

3078
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,639
if i can't change

3079
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,719
the point in the present so are we just

3080
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,480
like i think about we had shanna dobson

3081
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:24,880
and

3082
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,719
chris fields on and we were talking

3083
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,480
about express you know compressing and

3084
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,440
expanding

3085
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,239
time and space um and just time in all

3086
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:32,800
kinds of

3087
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,360
contexts like is it even a construct or

3088
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,560
how does it work

3089
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,560
and like non-archimedean time and all

3090
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,600
that stuff

3091
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,840
so i don't know what uh if you want to

3092
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,600
maybe unpack that a little bit for me

3093
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,119
because i'm just not kind of

3094
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:49,040
seeing the possibility of um

3095
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,880
of this changing the future without

3096
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,239
being able to change the present

3097
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,880
yeah totally possible and so and so for

3098
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,400
sure i'm not going to try to

3099
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,679
make the argument that uh we have a um

3100
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,560
a mature theory of you know free will of

3101
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,080
that of that kind i don't think we do

3102
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:08,800
but

3103
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,719
um and i think you're absolutely right

3104
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,239
in that that is in fact

3105
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:15,119
a really critical point if if if if your

3106
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:15,600
freedom

3107
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,800
in each slice is zero then many times

3108
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,119
zero it's still zero right so

3109
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,520
totally totally true i i think we can

3110
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,440
make two moves and again this is this is

3111
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:25,920
super

3112
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,239
early i you know i'm not claiming this

3113
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,239
is in any way gonna survive uh get a

3114
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:30,880
careful

3115
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,199
careful thought into the future um i

3116
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,080
think we can make two

3117
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,360
shifts one shift is that i think

3118
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,159
it's a again and again i'm like a broken

3119
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,520
record with this stuff but but i think i

3120
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,040
think that binary

3121
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:46,639
um this binary distinction between you

3122
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:47,119
have

3123
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,960
freedom or you do not i think that's

3124
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,639
wrong so so i think what you have

3125
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,679
it goes by amounts so so

3126
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,760
you may have very little you know if

3127
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,040
you're if you're if you're a

3128
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,199
mechanical clock you have very little

3129
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,080
and uh

3130
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,080
if you're some other type of living

3131
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,520
thing you may have more and then you may

3132
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,800
have more than that

3133
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,400
so then what you have is and this is

3134
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,560
super super amateurish but but just to

3135
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,000
kind of visualize

3136
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,040
what i see is the kind of um addition

3137
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,639
that you get in calculus

3138
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,840
where you start with extremely tiny

3139
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:18,719
things that are

3140
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,320
kind of zero but not really and

3141
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,080
eventually they add up to something

3142
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,600
right that's how i see it that's how i

3143
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,440
think that what you have at each point

3144
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,920
is a teeny tiny amount and if you look

3145
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,480
close

3146
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,000
you know basically it's an epsilon

3147
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,199
that's not worth talking about it's

3148
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,960
basically you don't have any

3149
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,760
but it isn't quite zero and over time

3150
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,320
that

3151
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,000
mental effort whatever that is that you

3152
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,480
put into you know

3153
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,920
working on your free will or on your

3154
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,080
kindness or whatever you're working on

3155
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,480
over time it integrates into an area

3156
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,199
even though

3157
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,199
you're integrating infinitely thin

3158
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,239
strips like that's

3159
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:51,600
that's the vision that i have in my head

3160
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,880
that if we just do away with the fact

3161
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,560
that it's actually zero but i don't

3162
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,480
think it's actually zero

3163
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,960
then you can build up something over

3164
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,880
time and you can and you can magnify

3165
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,119
and if you know i'll say one more thing

3166
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,639
which if we're gonna if we're gonna

3167
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,639
abuse physics like this right which i

3168
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:07,679
mean i realize this is all like

3169
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,840
completely informal and whatever

3170
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
if we're gonna abuse it um i'll make

3171
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,480
i'll make one more one more analogy

3172
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,239
if you think about what is the

3173
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,560
uh what what is a minimal level of

3174
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,719
agency so so so sometimes people ask

3175
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,679
me like um well is there a zero on your

3176
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:26,880
on your

3177
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,639
continuum right is there an actual zero

3178
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,920
like what's the minimum what is the

3179
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,560
smallest

3180
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,320
and so i think okay if you're going to

3181
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,840
pick if you're going to design the

3182
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,880
absolute

3183
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,199
minimal piece that still has some

3184
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,280
non-zero agency what does it need i feel

3185
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,719
like it needs two things

3186
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,080
it needs some minimal amount of

3187
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,080
uh decision making that isn't obviously

3188
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,800
caused by local causes right it needs at

3189
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,199
least

3190
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,840
something that is that reaches outward

3191
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
in terms of space or time or complexity

3192
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,480
or something

3193
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,719
that isn't obviously a locally

3194
01:39:58,719 --> 01:39:59,679
determined

3195
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:02,719
um you know necessity that that's one

3196
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,560
and the second thing it needs is some

3197
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,320
amount of goal directed

3198
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,360
activity something that looks like uh a

3199
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,719
goal directed activity

3200
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,440
so so once you've said that it seems to

3201
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,480
me that that

3202
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,719
individual particles already have this

3203
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,080
right because because quantum

3204
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,760
indeterminacy gives you the first one

3205
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,360
and least action principles give you the

3206
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,960
second so you've already got that and so

3207
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,520
now

3208
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,400
when you so so i think and again this is

3209
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,600
you know amateurish as far as the

3210
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,679
physics goes but my gut feeling is

3211
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,560
that there isn't a zero that you already

3212
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,360
start with

3213
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,080
some minimal amount and now you can do

3214
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,360
one of two things you can see you got

3215
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,679
these

3216
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,840
you got these particles you can do one

3217
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,199
of two things you can you can make a

3218
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:41,600
rock

3219
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,080
out of them so you aggregate them in a

3220
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,440
in in one way

3221
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,639
which basically uh gets rid of all those

3222
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,239
nice properties and

3223
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,639
it and and it and it ends up having

3224
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,480
having you know very low agency it

3225
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,239
doesn't it you know it just it just

3226
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:57,600
aggregates all of it in a way that

3227
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,520
doesn't do anything useful or

3228
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,480
if you're if you're alive you can uh you

3229
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,960
can amplify those properties and end up

3230
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,639
you know further down on the on the

3231
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,480
continuum so that's kind of

3232
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,880
my fuzzy story at the moment is that i

3233
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,000
think we start off

3234
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,360
at non-zero and then you can either

3235
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,880
stay there if you don't have the right

3236
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,119
organization or you can amplify the hell

3237
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:19,920
out of it and

3238
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,880
and get to you know to get to be more

3239
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,520
agential

3240
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,119
nice thanks i definitely think that uh

3241
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:31,440
non-zero is the right answer

3242
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,560
so we've got uh maybe like 15 minutes

3243
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,119
left

3244
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,159
and um you know i just there's some

3245
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,239
closing thoughts some room for

3246
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:42,960
some last minute questions uh sarah or

3247
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,320
steven do you have any

3248
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,840
last minute things you want to ask

3249
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,480
no my head has sufficiently exploded

3250
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,480
yeah no i think i think that was a night

3251
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,159
i mean i think there's a lot to think

3252
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,600
about because we've covered an awful lot

3253
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,520
of territory but um

3254
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,360
i think i think it's it was interesting

3255
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,800
to see that you're bringing the

3256
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,159
thingness

3257
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,719
and um that i know carl fristen talks

3258
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:07,600
about that

3259
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,119
um so i i suppose one last bit would be

3260
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:15,520
would you call yourself um a non-dual

3261
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:19,600
modest in the way that um carl

3262
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,719
talks about that idea or is that

3263
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,159
something a bit different or maybe not

3264
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,000
even relevant in this context

3265
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,400
yeah that's that's a good that's a good

3266
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,119
question so so i hesitate to put a name

3267
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:36,960
on it for for two reasons number one

3268
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,679
um everything that we've talked about so

3269
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:40,719
far

3270
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:44,239
has been very much from a functional

3271
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,239
third person perspective so so we

3272
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,280
haven't really touched

3273
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,360
the the so-called hard problem of

3274
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,560
consciousness or what the

3275
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,360
so in order and the thing is nothing

3276
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,199
that i've said

3277
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,239
touches this question of why is it like

3278
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,159
to be something that's one of these

3279
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:01,280
systems right

3280
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,159
so from that perspective assuming that

3281
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,760
we believe i mean some people you know

3282
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,199
will say that that's a non-problem and

3283
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,480
that there is no such thing and then

3284
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,119
whatever

3285
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:12,320
but i i i'm not 100 convinced of that

3286
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,760
actually and

3287
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,800
from so so so there are that i i do

3288
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,239
think there's a hard problem and i don't

3289
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:19,679
have anything that addresses it

3290
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:22,880
and so uh i don't know

3291
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,560
you know what camp that puts me in the

3292
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,080
other the other thing is that

3293
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:29,119
um i have a lot of um sort of

3294
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,639
uh uh kind of pan psychist sympathies in

3295
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,159
the following way

3296
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:37,679
so i think that if you scale

3297
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,320
down if you if you so so so what's one

3298
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,960
reason people don't like pancyth

3299
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,400
it means that you know it means that you

3300
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,000
think that rocks they have hopes and

3301
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,520
dreams like the rest of us okay so

3302
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,560
that's obviously

3303
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,280
not what i'm saying the reason people go

3304
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:51,840
to that

3305
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,600
to that extreme is because they've

3306
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,360
scaled down

3307
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,960
the structures that are needed for

3308
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,639
agency but they haven't scaled down the

3309
01:43:58,639 --> 01:43:59,520
expectation

3310
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,080
so so that's so yes it's it's silly to

3311
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,840
to think that rocks and dreams have to

3312
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,520
that rocks have the same hopes and

3313
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,119
dreams that we do however

3314
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,159
if you scale both sides of the equation

3315
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,840
i'm not at all sure why again if you

3316
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,920
don't if you if you're not into binary

3317
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,920
classifications it is conscious or it's

3318
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,400
not

3319
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,159
that that i think is definitely wrong so

3320
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,199
if if phenomenal consciousness is a kind

3321
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:22,239
of um

3322
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,960
continuum too i don't see any reason why

3323
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,800
there couldn't be a tiny

3324
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,960
bit of something that's super hard for

3325
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,639
us to imagine because we're used to a

3326
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,560
much a much bigger level of

3327
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,719
perception and consciousness that that

3328
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:35,920
isn't associated with

3329
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,679
a lot of other systems that we normally

3330
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,119
that you know that the people who

3331
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,560
normally work in cognitive science would

3332
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,520
never buy as

3333
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,239
as as as having consciousness so so so i

3334
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:44,960
have a lot of

3335
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,480
you know kind of sympathies on that

3336
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,320
front mainly because i don't buy this

3337
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,679
binary distinction

3338
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,440
um and we could talk about this actually

3339
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,800
interesting

3340
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,360
i don't even i i'll tell you why

3341
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,119
basically um

3342
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,199
bioengineering and the kinds of things

3343
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:00,159
that are possible

3344
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:03,119
now are they they are really dissolving

3345
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,040
a lot of things that seem to be

3346
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,920
uh sharp categories before and i'm not

3347
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,719
even sure

3348
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,679
at this point that um the distinction

3349
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,520
between first person and third person

3350
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,080
knowledge

3351
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,080
is even sharp and and i'll just i'll

3352
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,520
just draw you a simple picture

3353
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,679
and i preface this by saying um i i made

3354
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,760
a picture of this and i sent it to a um

3355
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,600
a well-known philosopher and he said it

3356
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,520
was you know horrible horrible and

3357
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,639
and uh and uh and not not useful but but

3358
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:29,199
we'll see

3359
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,840
we'll see what you think um imagine that

3360
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,560
uh

3361
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,960
you're looking at that there's a brain

3362
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,480
and there's some electrophysiology

3363
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,840
being done some electrodes stuck in

3364
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,440
there and that's it's being processed

3365
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,000
and you're

3366
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,040
and you're on the outside you're the

3367
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,159
scientist you're on the outside you're

3368
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,080
looking at that data

3369
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,000
uncontroversially third person right you

3370
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,440
have no idea what it's like to be that

3371
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,000
subject

3372
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,080
you are studying some signals that come

3373
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,679
off of that line

3374
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,800
now what we do is we change this

3375
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,560
we change the scenario a little bit and

3376
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,080
uh what we do is we take

3377
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,760
some of those interfaces that you know

3378
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,199
they have these interfaces for the blind

3379
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,400
that either go on your tongue

3380
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,320
or they go sometimes in your retina but

3381
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,840
basically they turn

3382
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,320
uh camera signals into something that's

3383
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,440
directly

3384
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,280
plugged into your brain with electrodes

3385
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,920
okay so now we we take that setup and

3386
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,199
instead of the camera we plug it

3387
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,960
directly into the electrophysiology

3388
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,159
apparatus

3389
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,920
so now what you're receiving is you're

3390
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,840
receiving a heavily processed

3391
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,960
signal but it's coming directly from

3392
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,280
that brain into your brain and what's

3393
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,880
interesting is that people who use these

3394
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,119
kind of sensory augmentation devices

3395
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,560
they will eventually report that it's

3396
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,080
just like seeing they learn to get

3397
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,679
around like the electric lollipop is

3398
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:36,960
this thing you stick on your tongue

3399
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,040
and it shocks your tongue in a way that

3400
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,520
um maps onto the pixels of a camera

3401
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,639
right and they say oh it's just like

3402
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:43,679
seeing it

3403
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:46,560
so uh so okay so now you've moved so you

3404
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,480
know it's like um

3405
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,040
uh it's it's sort of you know third

3406
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:51,760
person

3407
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,400
but you know it's maybe like 2.5 percent

3408
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,119
or something

3409
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,719
and then you can do another experiment

3410
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,960
you can say well what we're going to do

3411
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,080
is instead of using

3412
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,360
all this um like uh

3413
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,440
heavily electric you know all this

3414
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,560
electronics and

3415
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,679
and processing uh in between we're just

3416
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:11,199
going to connect the brains

3417
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,880
and we can and we can do this and the

3418
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,480
reason we know we can do this

3419
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,639
is that there are conjoined twins whose

3420
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,320
brains are in fact connected

3421
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,840
so that there's no you know sort of sort

3422
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,560
of

3423
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,080
clumsy electronic interface in the

3424
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,639
middle the brains are directly connected

3425
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,960
and so now you say okay so if i'm now if

3426
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,880
my brain is now connected to this other

3427
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,639
person having the experience

3428
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,639
it's sort of am i is that still third

3429
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:36,400
person and then you ask the question

3430
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:36,880
yeah but

3431
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,800
in your own brains of some people say ah

3432
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,159
that's an aberrant you know that's an

3433
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,040
aberrant case

3434
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,719
but in your own brain you've got pieces

3435
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,080
of the brain that have to talk to each

3436
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,080
other you're not an indivisible monad of

3437
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,280
some type right you are

3438
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,800
a bunch of pieces that also have to talk

3439
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,320
to each other so the left side has to

3440
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,000
talk to the right side in fact the front

3441
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,199
talks to the brain

3442
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,600
you are anyway pieces of the brain

3443
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,199
having to talk to each other

3444
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,119
and somehow that ends up being first

3445
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,360
person so now what we've just done is

3446
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:01,760
built

3447
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,760
a continuum where you can smoothly and

3448
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,440
we can fill in anywhere between these

3449
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,040
two systems i can fill in as

3450
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,280
as you know sort of finely as you want

3451
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,360
and you can smoothly move from from

3452
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,199
first person experience to third person

3453
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:13,920
is

3454
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,840
science because the bioengineering tells

3455
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,960
you that you can do it

3456
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,119
so so i'm not even sure that's a you

3457
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:20,880
know i'm not sure that's a distinction

3458
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,080
so i i you know it's hard to say

3459
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,719
uh anyway that's a long winded answer to

3460
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,040
your question

3461
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,600
wow i i was gonna ask one question now

3462
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,719
i'm gonna ask another one

3463
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,480
um this makes me think you know like

3464
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,480
related to core screening related to

3465
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,840
layers and levels of

3466
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,520
of uh different organisms like

3467
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,719
it just what you the kind of example you

3468
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:47,600
just laid out

3469
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,760
you know makes me question whether you

3470
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,119
can even stratify

3471
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,199
in that way or whether it makes sense to

3472
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,880
stratify in that way

3473
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,000
um but let me go back to um

3474
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
something we didn't cover and and i i

3475
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,440
heard it on your podcast

3476
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,040
and um you ended with a question

3477
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,239
related to moral philosophy um or ethics

3478
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:09,119
i guess not even

3479
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,280
i don't know the distinction there but

3480
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,159
yeah

3481
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:16,400
um i mean when

3482
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,599
you know if you're coming from the

3483
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,840
perspective of not

3484
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,360
believing in a binary uh between

3485
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,800
you said it better than i did living

3486
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
non-living whatever like agent versus

3487
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,520
not

3488
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,760
um and then you're making things like

3489
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,280
xenobots it's like

3490
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,440
that kind of if that's if you held those

3491
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,719
two views

3492
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,280
um of not believing in the binary then

3493
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,719
there it seems like there really

3494
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,400
wouldn't be an ethical question and so

3495
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,360
i'm wondering where your

3496
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,840
where your thinking is along that yeah

3497
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,440
no no i think i think there's definitely

3498
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,480
an ethical question

3499
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,719
uh and and i think it's not quite what

3500
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,000
we think it is but and i'll tell you

3501
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,199
what it is but let's just let's just

3502
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:52,480
take a step back so

3503
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,080
so long before anybody made xenobots

3504
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,800
we made humans right the old-fashioned

3505
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,199
way

3506
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:01,119
and so this is like uh you know then

3507
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:02,880
it's competence without comprehension

3508
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,480
right so we have no idea how it worked

3509
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,119
but for for

3510
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,400
you know hundreds of thousands of years

3511
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,880
we made other humans and so

3512
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,800
we take care of them as best we can most

3513
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,320
of the time sometimes

3514
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,719
not really very well you know so so so

3515
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:16,080
we already did that

3516
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,199
then uh we make all sorts of

3517
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,679
animals in terms of um of food

3518
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:22,960
production and other things

3519
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,040
we make hybrids so we make mules that

3520
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,119
are animals that never existed before

3521
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,679
right we make uh we've made new new

3522
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:30,239
plants

3523
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,560
so so so the first thing that's really

3524
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,679
critical and and

3525
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:35,280
often the the reason i'm sort of

3526
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,560
sensitized to all this is the people

3527
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,119
always say

3528
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,280
oh my god you're making xenobots it's a

3529
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,320
new like

3530
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,080
let's not let's not forget what we've

3531
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,760
already been doing right and

3532
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,840
let's let's be super clear that that

3533
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,520
this is a massive problem with the with

3534
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,119
the food industry right

3535
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:50,400
long before we get to worrying about

3536
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,760
zenobots there's all kinds of things

3537
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,199
that that we need to fix so

3538
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:54,400
i just want to be you know i kind of

3539
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,159
want to be clear that we've already been

3540
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:56,719
making

3541
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:58,639
animals and in fact other humans for

3542
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,239
which we sometimes take good

3543
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:01,520
responsibility and sometimes

3544
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,840
we we don't i think i think this is

3545
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:05,760
absolutely uh

3546
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,199
raises an ethical problem and the

3547
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:10,080
ethical problem is is the following

3548
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,320
when we um when we go to uh

3549
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,960
synthetic biology and and bioengineering

3550
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,920
kinds of seminars

3551
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,320
there's usually now a session that's

3552
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,440
about ethics

3553
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,760
and the session goes like this somebody

3554
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,719
will show

3555
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,679
a brain organoid made of human cells and

3556
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:28,560
someone will say

3557
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,880
oh my god that you shouldn't be doing

3558
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,560
that and somebody else

3559
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,480
will say well let's just see how much

3560
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,320
like a human brain it is and then they

3561
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,760
and then people spend a couple hours

3562
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,760
arguing about whether it is or is not

3563
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,360
enough like a human brain that they need

3564
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,880
to worry about it and maybe they end up

3565
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,320
saying it's fine or maybe they end up

3566
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,000
saying it's not fine but

3567
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,199
i think the much bigger issue is that

3568
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,880
whether or not something looks anything

3569
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,320
like a human brain

3570
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,360
is a very poor guide to how much you

3571
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,560
need to worry about it

3572
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:00,400
and in the past uh the way that you

3573
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,239
the way that we would figure out whether

3574
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,440
or not how much

3575
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,119
moral responsibility we have for a

3576
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:07,920
particular system went roughly like this

3577
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,560
you would sort of look at it and and if

3578
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,119
it was

3579
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,560
um squishy and and and warm and

3580
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,280
furry you would say yeah and if it was

3581
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,080
metallic

3582
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,760
and you know and it came from an

3583
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,599
assembly line you'd say do what you want

3584
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:22,560
no problem right

3585
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,760
so so two two things used to be a guide

3586
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:26,560
and even that

3587
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,159
we didn't do so well we can't obviously

3588
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:29,599
with those principles but but the two

3589
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,520
things that used to be a guide were

3590
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,520
where did it come from did it evolve or

3591
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,880
was it designed

3592
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,360
and what is it what is it made of and

3593
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,159
and it was a pr

3594
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,719
and that was pretty good right you could

3595
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:41,520
yeah if

3596
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,199
because if it was evolved you could look

3597
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,880
on the sort of the

3598
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,000
the tree of life and you could say it's

3599
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,040
a worm

3600
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,400
we don't need to fill out any forms when

3601
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,400
we do these experiments or you could say

3602
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,080
it's a frog i need to fill out a lot of

3603
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,920
forms before we can do experiments right

3604
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,040
for that then that's in fact

3605
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,880
how it works because you have because

3606
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,560
you know something about that

3607
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,639
that lineage and you make some sort of

3608
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:03,760
guesses about where

3609
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,440
things are and then if it's an octopus

3610
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,040
people really don't know what to do and

3611
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,320
then so on

3612
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,639
all of that is going completely out the

3613
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,639
window right so in the next

3614
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,800
uh in the next i don't know a couple of

3615
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,760
decades we are going to be surrounded by

3616
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,199
and this is another thing that i'm

3617
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:22,000
writing on the option space of possible

3618
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,599
creatures we're talking about

3619
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,560
uh hybrids cyborgs hybrids there's a

3620
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,639
million different ways to recombine

3621
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,520
evolved designed living non-living and

3622
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,040
software agents

3623
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,599
into new forms that have never existed

3624
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:36,239
before

3625
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:39,599
so what something looks like is no guide

3626
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:40,080
to

3627
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,159
what the cognition is where it came from

3628
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,520
meaning if all the design

3629
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,119
is going to be a bad question because

3630
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,560
half of the stuff we're building with is

3631
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:46,880
now

3632
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,239
evolved and and so on um all of the

3633
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:52,239
things you know it's just a machine

3634
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:53,840
versus oh but you know it's a nice

3635
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,520
mammal all that stuff is going to go out

3636
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,080
the window

3637
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,639
so to me the ethical problem is much

3638
01:53:58,639 --> 01:53:59,280
bigger

3639
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,800
than just asking about whether

3640
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,800
something's like a human brain the

3641
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,040
what we really are going to need is a

3642
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,000
new

3643
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,880
ethical system for learning how to deal

3644
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:09,920
with agents that look

3645
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,840
nothing like us and that don't look like

3646
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,440
anything we've ever seen before

3647
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,760
and yet are going to have all sorts of

3648
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,199
cognitive capacities

3649
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:20,000
and uh we have to let go of categories

3650
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,800
like machine

3651
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,880
like robot like um all these other

3652
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,119
things that really don't mean anything

3653
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,560
they never did but before but it was

3654
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,480
fine in the past it's no longer

3655
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,440
going to be useful um and that's that's

3656
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,080
the ethical

3657
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:36,719
that's the ethical problem

3658
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,840
uh so great so i'm gonna go stare at a

3659
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,440
wall and try to integrate this

3660
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,480
information

3661
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,520
