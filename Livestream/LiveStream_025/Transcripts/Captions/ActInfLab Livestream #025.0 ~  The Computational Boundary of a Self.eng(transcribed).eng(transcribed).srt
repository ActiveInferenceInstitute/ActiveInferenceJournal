acton flab live stream number 25.0

4
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
today is july 1st 2021 and we're going

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
to be talking about this paper

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
the computational boundary of a self

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
developmental bioelectricity

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,800
drives multicellularity and skill free

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,840
cognition

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
i'm blue and i'm here with daniel

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,120
awesome so welcome to

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
the active inference lab everyone we are

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
a participatory online lab that is

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
communicating

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,119
learning and practicing applied active

16
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,080
inference

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,680
you can find us at the links here on

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,159
this page this is a recorded

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,640
and archived live stream so please

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,200
provide

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
us with feedback so that we can improve

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
our work all backgrounds and

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
perspectives are welcome here

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
we will be following good video

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
etiquette for live streams

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
here at the short link you'll find all

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
of the live streams and different series

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,040
that we do

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
in the communications unit of the active

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
inference lab

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,079
and today we're doing

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,240
the contextualizing paper the dot zero

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,360
video for two

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
upcoming discussions in the first half

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
of july 2021

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
on the 6th and the 13th when we have

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
discussions

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
25.1 and 25.2 on this paper

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
and hopefully the author joining

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,880
today in active lab live stream number

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
25.0

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
we're going to be trying to set some

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
context and give an introduction

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
to the following paper the computational

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,759
boundary of a self

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,800
developmental bioelectricity drives

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,959
multicellularity

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
and scale free cognition by mike levin

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
and this video is just an introduction

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
to some of the ideas it's not a review

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
or a final word it's kind of like a

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
three-way intersection where we have

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,000
people

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,319
who might be within the active inference

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
community looking to be exposed to some

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
different areas like developmental

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
biology or cognitive science

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
and then another group of people who are

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
coming from the developmental biology or

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,680
cognitive science background

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
and curious about active inference and

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
then also we hope that this is exciting

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
and interesting even for people who are

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,480
not familiar

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
with active inference or developmental

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,360
biology or cognitive science

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
we will hopefully try to connect it

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
with some broader questions

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
so we're going to walk through some of

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
the aims and claims of the paper the

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
abstract and the roadmap

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,080
and bring a few big questions

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
and some key points of the paper so that

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
whether you read the paper or not you'll

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
hopefully be in a good spot to ask

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,680
questions

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
and learn more and of course in the 1

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,040
and

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
2 videos in the coming weeks we'll be

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
discussing the same paper so

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,080
save and submit your questions and

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
let us know if you'd like to participate

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
or contribute in any way

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
so here we are on the paper itself

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
that's a screenshot of the cover

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
and the aims and claims and i'll read

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,480
them so that

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
then daniel you can give a first thought

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
on what you thought was cool or what you

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,840
thought was important about the paper

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
so the aims and claims of the paper

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,040
first they define

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
individuals themselves in a way that

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
facilitates taxonomy comparison and

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
communication

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
with evolved created biological

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,239
artificial and

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,120
exobiological agents he says i propose a

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,959
fundamental definition of an individual

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
based on the ability to pursue goals

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
at an appropriate level of scale and

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,439
organization and suggest a formalism for

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
defining and comparing the cognitive

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
capacities

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
of highly diverse types of agents second

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,920
he proposes a plausible naturalistic

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
framework for the evolutionary scale-up

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
of cognition

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,480
from the earliest origins of life

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,159
hypothesizing about the forces that

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
drove it and the major transitions along

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
the continuum

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
and the goal of this research program is

114
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
to show how complex agency and goal

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,279
directiveness

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
evolves naturally from ancient

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,960
mechanisms so

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,638
daniel what do you think about that

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
nice work well i thought the paper was

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,639
pretty

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
exciting because it touches on just so

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
many big topics like

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
goal setting and agency cognition in

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
natural and artificial systems

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
multi-scale systems and then it links it

126
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,360
in a way that people might not

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
expect which is through developmental

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
biology

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,639
and bioelectricity which are kind of

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
like processes that these life forms or

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
other forms engage in so to be able to

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,160
connect

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
things that are awesome about systems

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
that matter like again

135
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
their goal seeking nature their ability

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
to do cognition and then connect that to

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
a process theory

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
it's kind of what we're all about in

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
active inference connecting

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
the cool features of the world to

141
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,479
process theories that are tractable

142
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,639
cool so moving on to the abstract i'll

143
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
read the first part and then you can

144
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
read the next slide

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
so all epistemic agents physically

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
consist of parts that must somehow

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
comprise an integrated cognitive self

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
biological individuals consist of

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
subunits organs cells and molecular

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
networks that are themselves complex

151
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
and competent in their own native

152
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
contexts how to how do coherent

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
biological individuals result from the

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,160
activity of smaller sub-agents to

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,360
understand the evolution

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
and function of metazoan creatures

157
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
bodies and minds it is essential to

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,240
conceptually explore the origin of

159
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
multicellularity

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
and the scaling of basal cognition of

161
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,000
individual cells

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
into a coherent larger organism

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
so i find this line of research truly

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
fascinating and really a burning

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,520
question for me

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
is how information is consolidated or

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
prioritized across skills

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,720
whether it's core screening or salience

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,120
or

170
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,960
something else so do you want to read

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
the next part

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
yep just one thought on that and it's

173
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
going to be a theme that's returned to

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
it's that cognition or agency doesn't

175
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,280
just

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
blink into existence at a larger level

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,639
of analysis

178
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
it's actually composed of smaller

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
cognitive units

180
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
and so it's kind of like cognition all

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,199
the way down that helps us

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
integrate across scales but also

183
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
recognize what's special about larger

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
levels of organization like culture

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
so part two of the abstract in this

186
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,880
article

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
i synthesize ideas in cognitive science

188
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
evolutionary biology and developmental

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,039
physiology

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
towards a hypothesis about the origin of

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
individuality

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,440
scale-free cognition i propose a

193
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
fundamental definition

194
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
of an individual based upon the ability

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
to pursue goals at an appropriate level

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
of scale and organization

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
and suggest a formalism for defining and

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,720
comparing

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
the cognitive capacities of highly

200
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,280
diverse types of agents

201
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
any self is demarcated by a

202
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,039
computational surface

203
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
the spatial temporal boundary of events

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,080
that it can measure

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,360
model and try to affect the surface sets

206
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
a functional boundary

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,120
a cognitive light cone which defines the

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,919
scale

209
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
and limits of its cognition i

210
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
hypothesize that

211
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
higher level goal-directed activity and

212
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,479
agency

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,120
resulting in larger cognitive boundaries

214
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
evolves from the primal homeostatic

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,680
drive

216
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
of living things to reduce stress the

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
difference between current conditions

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
and life optimal conditions

219
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
so i like this goal directed like aspect

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
of this and it really kind of implies to

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,759
me that the

222
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,240
it's like biological cognition has to be

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,479
biological but i wonder about like

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
you know what is the goal of of

225
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
molecules in their like organization

226
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
right is that like a goal directed

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
activity like the protons and neutrons

228
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,639
and electrons

229
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
want to like reduce their uncertainty

230
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
about where they are in space or how

231
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,800
does it work at like a non-biological

232
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
level makes me wonder that

233
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
or strain strain and stress those are

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
things we psychologically experience but

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
then you can have you know like a

236
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
ring with four carbons it's under strain

237
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,479
and the carbons

238
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
they seek to do what well get into a

239
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
less stressed position

240
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,240
like a unstrained arrangement for sure

241
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,479
the next part the mechanisms of

242
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,080
developmental bioelectricity

243
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,919
the ability of all cells to form

244
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
electrical networks that process

245
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,400
information

246
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
suggests a plausible set of gradual

247
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
evolutionary steps that naturally lead

248
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,039
from

249
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
physiological homeostasis in single

250
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,159
cells

251
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
to memory prediction and ultimately

252
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
complex cognitive agents

253
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
via scale up of the basic drive of

254
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
infotaxis

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
recent data on the molecular mechanisms

256
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,880
of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a

257
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,839
model of how

258
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,839
increasingly sophisticated cognitive

259
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
functions emerge smoothly from cell to

260
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
cell communication

261
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,600
used to guide embryogenesis and

262
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
regeneration

263
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
this set of hypotheses provides a novel

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,320
perspective

265
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
on numerous phenomena such as cancer and

266
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
makes several unique

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,279
testable predictions for

268
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
interdisciplinary research that have

269
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
implications not only for evolutionary

270
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
developmental biology

271
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
but also for biomedicine and perhaps

272
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
artificial intelligence

273
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
and exobiology do you have any thoughts

274
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
on that daniel

275
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
i guess it's just cool to see

276
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
development and cognition

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
come on to equal grounding because there

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
was ecology evolution and development

279
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
eco evo devo

280
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
and then it's sort of that's natural

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
things happening and then

282
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,360
often cognition and especially

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,680
computational perspectives on cognition

284
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
are seen as unnatural or designed and so

285
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,959
again

286
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
all of these pieces are going to be

287
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
woven together with a few

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
pieces like bioelectricity and light

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
cones that maybe people

290
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,600
aren't uh expecting cool

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,920
so the road map of the paper we're gonna

292
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
go through the introduction

293
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
then the paper is broken up into lots of

294
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
different parts what is the self how do

295
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
you define an individual

296
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,240
body patterning cognition

297
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,600
multicellularity versus cancer

298
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
defining individuation from a cognitive

299
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
perspective

300
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,000
the agent's evolutionary backstory

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
conclusion future outlook discussion and

302
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
then uh some predictions and research

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
program

304
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
and then in the end uh what does it feel

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
like to be a pancreas which

306
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
i i renamed that part but maybe you

307
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
changed it back so we'll see

308
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,640
do you want to read over the keywords

309
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
so here's the provided keywords were

310
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,399
development

311
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
bioelectricity and the related gap

312
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
junctions

313
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
primitive cognition and our favorite

314
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
active inference

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
so development i like this quote from

316
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,920
smith seth

317
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
mary and maynard smith which i can never

318
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
say or says last name i feel bad sorry

319
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,720
yours

320
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
developmental biology can be seen as the

321
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,959
study of how information

322
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
in the genome is translated into the

323
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,399
adult structure

324
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
and evolutionary biology of how the

325
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
information came to be there

326
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
in the first place so that's a kind of

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
cool definition of development

328
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
do you have any thoughts on that

329
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
it reminds me of earlier discussions we

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
had about

331
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
tin bergens four y's which are kind of

332
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
related to aristotle's four whys it's

333
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,399
like why is there a foot

334
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
well the easy sort of material answer is

335
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
because there's matter in the shape of a

336
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,040
foot

337
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
but maybe you want to know something

338
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
that's historical and over really long

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,519
periods of time

340
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
it's a story about evolution how the

341
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,600
foot came to be selected on through time

342
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
but development is just right there in

343
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,720
the middle where it's

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
the story for that individual how that

345
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
foot came to be

346
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
um thanks said blue could you turn down

347
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,480
my mic

348
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
it um apparently it's a little loud or

349
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
distorted thank you for the feedback

350
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
yeah if anybody has comments on like the

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
audio

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
um blue's doing an awesome job of first

353
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,279
broadcaster role

354
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
so thanks ed cool all right hopefully

355
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
that's a little bit better

356
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,320
all right uh

357
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,880
bioelectricity so this is a quote from

358
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,079
the paper

359
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
developmental bioelectricity is the

360
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
ubiquitous exchange of slowly changing

361
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
ion-based voltage signals within and

362
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,480
among cells

363
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
all cells are electrically active and

364
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
modern neurons evolved from pre-neural

365
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
precursors that were already reaping the

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
benefits of ionic signaling for

367
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,839
computation

368
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
computation ionic signaling for

369
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,360
computation

370
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
so there's some ion channels i like that

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
cool like digital

372
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
um image of ion channels and cells and

373
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
of course this painting by alex gray

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,639
like isn't officially

375
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
bioelectricity but whenever i think of

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
the word bioelectricity i always think

377
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
of this picture

378
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
do you have any thoughts and to connect

379
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
the developmental aspect to what is

380
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,519
mentioned

381
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
here about the cells being electrically

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
active

383
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
the neural tissue arises during

384
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
development from neuro ectoderm

385
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
so before there was sort of an inner

386
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
layer of these electrically specialized

387
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,920
cells

388
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,959
ones that we call neurons there

389
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
was an outer layer and we see that

390
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,639
recapitulated

391
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,040
in embryogenesis when the neural tube is

392
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,839
closed

393
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
so that's combining sort of ontogeny

394
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,200
recapitulates phylogeny which is just to

395
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
say that

396
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
the development of the organism carries

397
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,120
some

398
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,760
resonance with the way that the organism

399
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
evolved through time

400
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
and then just to remind that every cell

401
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,240
has

402
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
those pumps that maintain charge maybe

403
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
not all of them are involved

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
in rapid fire signaling but to maintain

405
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
ionic gradients

406
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
and therefore bioelectric gradients is

407
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
essentially

408
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
what cells do with remembrance cool

409
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,680
and awesome segway into talking about

410
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
gap junctions

411
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
so this is like something that's near

412
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
and dear to my heart with my like

413
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
neuroscience background

414
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,199
so gap junctions like were originally

415
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
attributed to like

416
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
neurons right like that's it like gap

417
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
junctions are there at the synapse and

418
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
you know they facilitate the electrical

419
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
signaling between neural cells but

420
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
but really they're um channels that

421
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
permit cell to cell

422
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
transfer of ions directly and they were

423
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
originally described in nerve and muscle

424
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
but they're really found in virtually

425
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,079
all cells that are present

426
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,560
in solid tissues um and then i just did

427
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,440
a quick like

428
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
brief look up of a recent review of gap

429
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,880
junctions and it's cool like they're

430
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
involved in all kinds of

431
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
um things right like so self

432
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,279
proliferation immune response migration

433
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,440
optosis carcinogenesis

434
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,160
hyperproliferative skin disorders

435
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
lymphatic vessel diseases

436
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
inflammatory lung diseases that's like

437
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
asthma liver injury and neoplastic

438
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,399
disorders

439
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
that's also cancer so i thought that

440
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
that was kind of a neat

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
um thing any thoughts on this one daniel

442
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
just that active inference helps us

443
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,800
think about how

444
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
agents communicate and interact so if

445
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
there's two cells and they have totally

446
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
disjoint membranes

447
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
then they can both modify a niche in

448
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
common so they could pump ions in and

449
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,959
out of the fluid

450
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
like the extracellular matrix that's

451
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,399
surrounding the cells

452
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,680
um so there's a common niche that

453
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,040
they're sharing that's like the least

454
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
connected they could be

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
and then there are also ways in which

456
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
they can have a long-term connection

457
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
with a higher throughput so we're seeing

458
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
a lot of these ideas of communication

459
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
where you can talk about these two

460
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,279
agents now directly exchanging

461
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,079
information

462
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
with each other as their electrochemical

463
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,199
niche

464
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
rather than just jointly modifying the

465
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
shared fluid that they're in

466
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,839
cool okay next

467
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,160
all right primitive cognition see if i

468
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,440
can play this video did you want me to

469
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
play it

470
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,839
sure if it works on your side let's see

471
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,320
it

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
perfect

473
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
role of acton in cell motility stunning

474
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
3d animation

475
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,399
maybe we don't need the sound but um

476
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,440
next well what um is written in the

477
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,920
paper

478
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
is the emerging field known as basal

479
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
cognition

480
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
tracks the evolutionary history of

481
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
learning and decision making processes

482
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
beginning from the dynamic

483
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
problem-solving capacities of cellular

484
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,560
and subcellular forms many examples of

485
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,440
memory anticipation context-dependent

486
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
decision-making and learning

487
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
are exhibited by organisms from yeast

488
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
and bacteria

489
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
to plants and somatic cells

490
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
cool so down at the bottom what does

491
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
cognition or intelligent behavior look

492
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,279
like across scales

493
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
where and how does cognition arise and

494
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
how does it develop or evolve convergent

495
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
and divergent features

496
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
and where does active inference come

497
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,439
into play

498
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
i think that first question is fun

499
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
because it's a little

500
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,320
easy to off the cuff just say well i i

501
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
don't recognize the intelligence of a

502
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,199
cell

503
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
because it's not um you know doing an

504
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
undergrad course

505
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
or it's not doing skillful performance

506
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
like we talked about in a

507
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
previous discussion so will we have a

508
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,720
human-centric

509
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,119
conception of intelligence tied up with

510
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,280
all of our cultural understandings

511
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,599
or is there something about intelligent

512
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
behavior that might help us

513
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
recognize it across scales and that's

514
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,360
what turns us to these fundamentals

515
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,840
like memory anticipation context

516
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
dependent decision making

517
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,679
and then once we open up to that

518
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,720
functional level

519
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
of intelligent behavior in cognition we

520
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,559
start seeing it everywhere

521
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
and so instead of just seeing these

522
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
cells and their behavior as

523
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
taking part of an intelligent system

524
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
that again only blinks into existence at

525
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
the top level

526
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,039
they're in and of themselves intelligent

527
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
actors

528
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,840
awesome so let's see

529
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
the video got me locked in here sorry

530
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
how about that you want to take us

531
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
through that slide daniel

532
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,520
yep so it's written in the paper

533
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,559
i propose oh well we'll come back to um

534
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
homeostasis in a second at the top it's

535
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
written

536
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
developmental bioelectricity is the

537
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,520
ubiquitous exchange

538
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,840
of slowly changing ion-based voltage

539
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
signals within and among cells

540
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
all cells are electrode electrically

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
active and we talked about that just a

542
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
few slides ago

543
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
how ancient are these mechanisms how

544
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
early was bioelectric coordination

545
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
exploited by evolution so this is

546
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
raising the notion

547
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,559
that early cognition was biomechanical

548
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
it was biophysical it involved

549
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,919
morphological

550
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,240
computation like we saw on the previous

551
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
slide with the movie

552
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
of cells but also electrical affordances

553
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,000
existed from the beginning and so if

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
biophysical affordances existed from the

555
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,799
beginning

556
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,160
and allowed for cognition to arise then

557
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
it makes just as much sense to say that

558
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
electrical affordances

559
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
for cells to communicate and do these

560
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
types of cognitive processes

561
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,720
also were exploited very early in

562
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,520
evolution

563
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,320
so primitive meaning at a smaller level

564
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,960
but also

565
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,240
earlier on and suggesting that it's

566
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
bioelectric was one of the earlier uh

567
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,760
mechanisms of cognition is pretty cool

568
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
and i like this quote from the paper

569
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
that says the ability to operate toward

570
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
a region and state space may be the

571
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
primitive origin

572
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
of complex cognitive systems that can

573
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
entertain counter factuals

574
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
which is to remember or anticipate

575
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,120
events that are not occurring

576
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
right now so we'll touch back on

577
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,640
homeostasis but how are the goals

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
related to homeostasis

579
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,720
how does bioelectricity play a role in

580
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,400
homeostasis and i think we come back

581
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
around to that

582
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
on 17 i wanted to give an example about

583
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,480
where bioelectricity and development

584
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
came together with cognition and

585
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
for some people genetic reductionism

586
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,200
makes it so that you know the story is

587
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
not complete until we know

588
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
what gene is involved and i think that

589
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,919
they'd find this

590
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,200
recent 2021 paper from drosophila fruit

591
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
flies to be really interesting

592
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,919
because what they do with a series of

593
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,159
experiments is actually demonstrate the

594
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,039
importance of

595
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,520
membrane depolarization which is to say

596
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,840
bioelectric

597
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,159
capacity in uh

598
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,120
gene regulatory networks so like hh and

599
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,240
ptc

600
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,080
are uh proteins that are produced by

601
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
loci and dna and they're part of

602
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,840
feedback loops

603
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
involving the depolarization of

604
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
membranes so they show that

605
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
regulation of that membrane potential

606
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,280
has an important role

607
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,159
in signaling hedgehog and that there's a

608
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,000
mutually reinforcing relationship

609
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
between these two processes and then

610
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,440
what does that allow

611
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,559
well it allows morphological computation

612
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,760
of this developing disk of

613
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
the fly that later turns into the wing

614
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,360
and so there's advantages and

615
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
disadvantages like

616
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
with diffusible molecules there's a

617
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,120
tremendous amount of expressivity

618
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
with what that molecule is like you have

619
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
an infinite number of hormone

620
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
possibilities

621
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
but on the other hand it's very slowly

622
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,280
diffusing and

623
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
maybe you can only signal a short range

624
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,520
on the other hand there's only like

625
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
one electricity there's not like the

626
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
blue membrane potential and you know the

627
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,880
pink membrane potential

628
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,559
as parallel membrane potential there's

629
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,159
only one membrane potential

630
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
so it's kind of a big knob to turn

631
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,679
however

632
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,520
as shown here it really does play a

633
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
functional role

634
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,039
in stabilizing gene regulatory networks

635
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,080
if you were missing

636
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
that part of the puzzle it would be as

637
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
incomplete as if you were missing a

638
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,039
critical signaling molecule

639
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,320
so i suspect that as advances the

640
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,600
kind that are going to be referenced in

641
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,520
this paper uh advances

642
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
in being able to visualize and track and

643
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
manipulate bioelectric fields

644
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
become more accessible that more and

645
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,600
more systems that were thought to be

646
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,720
purely chemical

647
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
or purely mechanical i think that

648
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
there'll be a more important

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
role for bioelectricity right it is like

650
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,080
one

651
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
big surface one membrane potential so

652
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,159
you have one membrane and that's like

653
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
the the differentiator right between

654
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,039
that's the boundary

655
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,320
right is what is enclosed or

656
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
encapsulated in the membrane versus what

657
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
is not

658
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
uh okay so here we are active inference

659
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
this is the final keyword and i pulled

660
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
this image out from the active inference

661
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,000
lab

662
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,720
um a previous uh live stream that we did

663
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,200
with

664
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,520
um ines and uh tomas

665
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
or thomas so this is the free energy

666
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
principle computation and

667
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
computationalism and realism and tragedy

668
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
and so this is just the basic

669
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
action perception loop so you have

670
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,320
active states

671
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,559
external states sensory states and

672
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,760
internal states

673
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,559
and so the both of the active states and

674
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,679
the sensory states

675
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
are the blanket states right so you have

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
the the internal can act on the external

677
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
uh via these two blanket states so this

678
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,679
is all of the sensory perception of the

679
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,799
organism

680
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,360
and the degree on which they're able to

681
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,840
act

682
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
on the environment do you want to add

683
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,679
any thoughts here daniel

684
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
it's just that active inference is a

685
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
unifying framework for thinking about

686
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,120
perception cognition and action and it

687
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
does that in

688
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
a scale-free way that's grounded in

689
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
bayesian statistics and physics

690
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
so it's going to be deployed as a way to

691
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
help us

692
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
look for different kinds of behavior

693
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
across scales because the internal state

694
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
could be internal to a cell

695
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,279
it could be internal to a tissue

696
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,679
internal to the organism etc

697
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
and it's that expressivity of the active

698
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
inference framework

699
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
that is going to come into play in the

700
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
paper

701
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,120
awesome and it's a process a scale-free

702
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,520
process

703
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,120
okay active inference as brought up in

704
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
this paper

705
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,679
the author says agents scaled up by

706
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,640
evolving from

707
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,279
basic homeostatic loops driven by active

708
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,240
inference

709
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
surprise minimization via addition of

710
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
delays which are memory

711
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,559
anticipation which is inference and

712
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,679
networks

713
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
spatially distributed processing that

714
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
enables learning and progressive

715
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
abstraction or generalization from the

716
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,159
data

717
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
gathering into larger collectives with

718
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,840
optimal information structure also

719
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,320
improves the computational ie predictive

720
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
capabilities

721
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,799
and gives rise to functional

722
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,720
relationships such as memories encoded

723
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,440
goal states

724
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,480
test operate test exit loops that exist

725
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,279
over and above

726
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,120
any individual member these levels

727
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
coexist enabling numerous coherent

728
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
selves of different skills to be

729
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,360
implemented by any collection of living

730
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,678
matter

731
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
that's intense uh the other one of the

732
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
other pieces about active

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
inference that differentiates it from a

734
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,919
framework like reinforcement learning

735
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,200
is right there um that there's the

736
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
minimization of surprise and in order to

737
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
minimize surprise through time you kind

738
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,760
of have to be

739
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
doing two things that at first pass

740
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,039
don't seem like they're going to

741
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
facilitate each other which is the

742
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
pursuit of

743
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,360
what you already know is going to be

744
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
useful that's called pragmatic value

745
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,480
as well as the pursuit of sampling

746
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,200
things that

747
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
will be informative that's epidemic

748
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,559
value and so

749
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
in active inference the way that agents

750
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,919
through deep time

751
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
minimize their surprise about perception

752
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
that's what's referenced in the top

753
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
paragraph about perceptual control

754
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,120
control theory

755
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,880
the way that the agents minimize their

756
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,919
surprise about their future

757
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,039
expectatio expectations of perception

758
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,320
is going to be by jointly working on the

759
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,200
pragmatic and

760
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,799
epidemic aspects of their behavior

761
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
and thinking about what behavior is

762
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
going to be minimizing free energy in

763
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,520
terms of

764
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
kind of existing on the optimal

765
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
trade-off where you're

766
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,679
performing but also learning so these

767
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
are a few features of active inference

768
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
that differentiate it and then if we

769
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
think about like a growth cone of a

770
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,120
neuron

771
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
is it doing reinforcement learning is it

772
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,039
doing reward maximization

773
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
it just barely makes sense but once we

774
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,559
start to think about surprise

775
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,440
minimization

776
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
like it's endowed with an evolutionary

777
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
prior it expects to connect to a

778
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
neuromuscular junction

779
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
then maybe some of its searching

780
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,039
behavior makes more sense

781
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
and in the top section also the author

782
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
you know states that the sensory

783
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
input layer is what enables active

784
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,480
inference to operate

785
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
so because there's receptors and

786
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,760
channels that that's the perception the

787
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,480
perception

788
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
that for a cell um yeah anyway just

789
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,720
thought i'd add that in

790
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
okay greeting sarah

791
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
hi sarah uh

792
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
daniel do you want to read these uh core

793
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
assumptions and i'll fix the thing

794
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,080
thank you classic so i'm only gonna

795
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
read the uh the two

796
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
uh highlighted parts here because these

797
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
are paragraphs that people want more

798
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
detail on they can definitely read the

799
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
paper to learn more about

800
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
there's three core assumptions that are

801
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
laid out really

802
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,080
clearly so i appreciated that about this

803
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,799
paper

804
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
that it makes clear assumptions and

805
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
shows how those assumptions come into

806
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
play and then basically there's two

807
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,120
avenues for

808
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,159
disagreeing i guess one would be i think

809
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
those are invalid assumptions but

810
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,320
they're um properly applied or one can

811
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,679
think that there are valid assumptions

812
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,000
but

813
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,399
improperly applied and so that helps

814
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,120
structure

815
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
discussion with the contents of the

816
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:42,720
paper

817
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,240
so the first core assumption is a

818
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
commitment to evolution

819
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
every capacity has a natural history and

820
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,559
emerged from simpler variants

821
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,200
um i guess also evolution can perceive

822
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
through a reduction of complexity so

823
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
eventually it had to have emerged from

824
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
simpler variants but in the short time i

825
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
guess it could have emerged from more

826
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
complex variants

827
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
but the commitment to evolution means

828
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,799
the commitment um

829
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,000
to the dispelling of magical thinking

830
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
and not looking for some sort of a

831
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
metaphysical answer to our physical

832
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
questions

833
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
and the second assumption of the three

834
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,960
is it is assumed that all metaphors are

835
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,840
to be judged

836
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
by their utility in driving scientific

837
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,200
progress

838
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
and there is not a binary categorization

839
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
of scientific pictures which should be

840
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,520
taken

841
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,679
literally or not which can be decided a

842
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
priori so we're not going around with um

843
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,559
post-it notes saying what's real or

844
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,520
what's not

845
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,520
we're using utility as a guiding metric

846
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,919
um we can actually just take a quick

847
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,080
visualization and then sarah you can

848
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,960
say hello and give any uh thoughts if

849
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,679
you'd like

850
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,440
but we previously in live stream 15 and

851
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,320
20

852
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
talked a lot about this continuum from

853
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
realism to instrumentalism

854
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,399
like is active inference the territory

855
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,120
itself

856
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
that's realism we're really describing

857
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,960
what's really there when we make an

858
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,320
active inference model

859
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,880
or instrumentalism on the right side

860
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,440
here

861
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,080
is like active inference as a map we're

862
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,960
just using it

863
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
as something that could be um used to

864
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
capture some features of a system

865
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
and then used instrumentally like a

866
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,279
model and then

867
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,360
here we've introduced sort of this third

868
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,039
vector of utility

869
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
which is like okay whether it's the map

870
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
or the territory orthogonal to that

871
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
is is it useful and so this is a space

872
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
that's describing not just where we can

873
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,399
think about active inference existing

874
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,559
but also ways to evaluate different

875
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,480
models not that one is better than the

876
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,520
other but these are just different

877
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
dimensions

878
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,279
that models exist on

879
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
all right okay maybe go to the third

880
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
core assumption on to the third one

881
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
so much of the discussion centers around

882
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,159
goals

883
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,320
related to teleology a hotly debated

884
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,279
topic

885
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
here goal directedness is taken in the

886
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,039
non-magical cybernetic

887
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,520
engineering and control theory sense of

888
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
a feedback system that operates to

889
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
maximize some specific state of affairs

890
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,360
which can be modeled as a dynamical

891
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
system

892
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,799
with the tractors in its state space

893
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,480
so to reiterate these three assumptions

894
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,440
the first one is

895
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,559
evolution the second one is utility and

896
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,600
the third one

897
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,480
is a non-magical sense of goal

898
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
directedness

899
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
so these three assumptions play nice

900
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,120
with each other

901
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,600
and then they also lead directly to this

902
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,559
final statement

903
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,720
that except for a few brief remarks at

904
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,919
the end

905
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,559
no claims about consciousness defined

906
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,679
rapidly as

907
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,399
first person experience or sense of self

908
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,360
as qualia

909
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,679
are made all the examples concern

910
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,480
functional

911
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,799
third person objective capacities

912
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,720
computation and behaviors

913
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,039
so we're kind of like outside of systems

914
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
looking at them

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
as an investigator this isn't about the

916
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,159
first person perspective

917
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,559
and there's always so much fascination

918
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,360
and interest

919
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,760
in what consciousness is but in a way

920
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
these three assumptions

921
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,440
go a really long distance towards just

922
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
saying hey let's look at the

923
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,000
systems behavior as we observe it rather

924
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
than as we imagined it to be

925
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,919
like so that's at least the starting

926
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,799
point for

927
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,799
a great discussion um

928
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,799
before we jump into the figures sarah do

929
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,919
you want to

930
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,000
give any thoughts or say hello

931
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
uh sure yeah i am i

932
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,840
i'm kind of coming in pretty disoriented

933
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,679
but uh

934
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,679
tried to follow michael's work uh quite

935
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,960
a bit and i'm enjoying

936
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
uh discussing it from whatever angle

937
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,480
comes up

938
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
and oh i don't know uh background who

939
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
cares um

940
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,200
i'm in philosophy right now um yeah

941
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,679
that's fine

942
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,600
nice well any slide you want to

943
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,720
chime in on is great so

944
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,840
find the slides okay they're yeah anyway

945
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
um

946
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,600
um go for figure one blue if you want

947
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
sure so this is a continuum of

948
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,679
cognitive powers so and this is just the

949
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,120
first part of the figure we'll show the

950
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,960
next part in the next slide so this is a

951
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,600
tote

952
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,720
which is test operate test exit loop

953
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,240
uh which is a schema of a basic

954
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,640
homeostatic

955
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,080
cycle so the author says that by

956
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
continuously taking action to minimize

957
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,960
the distance

958
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
the difference in error between the

959
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
current state of affairs

960
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
and a set point describing a different

961
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,240
possible future state of affairs it

962
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,480
enables a system to pursue goals despite

963
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,519
perturbations

964
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,760
from the outside world and intrinsic

965
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,720
noise

966
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
so this is i thought cool like you know

967
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,320
the first

968
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,039
like possible counter factual like yes

969
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,640
it's 75 degrees

970
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,559
and i have plenty of sodium and

971
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,240
potassium and you know

972
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
calcium but but what if i don't always

973
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,440
what if it's not always this way

974
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,039
right what if what if it my state

975
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,799
changes so like that

976
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,039
the first counterfactual maybe enabled

977
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,120
this kind of homeostatic feedback loop i

978
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
thought that that was a neat

979
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,559
idea put forward in the paper so how is

980
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
this related to active inference or

981
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,440
systems engineering daniel

982
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,480
well the terminology reminded me a lot

983
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
more of engineering

984
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,840
than we often see like sensors and

985
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
actuators

986
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,559
it makes it sound like it's going to be

987
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,919
a robot

988
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
and also this like test exit sounds like

989
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,159
we're going to be doing sort of software

990
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,279
evaluation

991
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
but we can pretty clearly see the

992
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,480
skeleton of

993
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
action perception loops whether it's

994
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,600
framed as it was

995
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,679
a couple slides ago with internal

996
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,880
external states

997
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,000
and then blanket states or here where

998
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
you have to basically have the

999
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,039
difference between the desired and

1000
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,399
expected value

1001
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,559
leading to policy selection not shown

1002
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
here leading to action

1003
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,440
actions cause events in the environment

1004
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,359
on the yonder side of the blanket

1005
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,359
and then the state of the external

1006
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,480
environment

1007
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,560
influences the measurements on the

1008
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
inbound side which

1009
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,399
are again contrasted with the idealized

1010
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:20,960
state

1011
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
and that leads to another round of

1012
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,480
action selection so this is a

1013
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,000
engineering way of laying out the tote

1014
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,359
test operate test exit loop

1015
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,159
but who knows we're able to jump from

1016
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,440
active inference pretty

1017
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,320
nicely into a more engineering frame and

1018
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,639
so

1019
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,199
perhaps engineering could be integrated

1020
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,560
closely into active inference

1021
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,359
yeah it seems like the blanket states

1022
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,679
like the sensors and actuators like

1023
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,239
our um you know the action perception

1024
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,839
part are here in the middle and

1025
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,839
so it kind of reminds me of the active

1026
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,760
inference loop like diagram that we

1027
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,560
showed earlier so it's interesting

1028
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
uh next part do you want to go through

1029
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
this one danielle

1030
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
yeah so in figure 1 b the

1031
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
caption reads that the scale is showing

1032
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,599
how different types of activity and

1033
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,960
systems can be ranked

1034
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
according to their degree of

1035
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,640
purpose-ness so again

1036
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,040
think about purpose in the third person

1037
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,160
not the first person

1038
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
it's not the sense of purpose but more

1039
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,520
um

1040
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,880
what i believe hofstetter called the

1041
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,599
anti-species

1042
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,119
i'm not sure to pronounce it but it was

1043
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,880
like think about the most mindless

1044
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,680
behavior

1045
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
and then push away from that and that's

1046
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,320
what you can call purposeful

1047
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,839
rather than imagining that there's like

1048
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
this pure crystallized

1049
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,720
purposeful behavior and it sort of goes

1050
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,200
from

1051
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,079
bottom to top in terms of the degree of

1052
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,640
purpose

1053
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,760
ability and on the bottom we see

1054
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,320
um basically just action that doesn't

1055
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,880
appear

1056
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
to have any kind of um

1057
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,400
sense or purpose to it like maybe gas

1058
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
molecules bumping around

1059
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,000
and then we progress through higher and

1060
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,359
higher levels of

1061
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,400
feedback loops and then each one of

1062
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,240
these brackets it's kind of like a

1063
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,200
distinction

1064
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,359
so like starting left behavior you can

1065
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,480
take the right branch or

1066
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
the bottom branch passive behavior like

1067
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
a ball that's being thrown or active

1068
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,280
behavior

1069
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,680
okay active behavior is it gonna be

1070
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
non-random

1071
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,480
um or random like many things are random

1072
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,160
but you know is it a wind-up toy that's

1073
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
just doing something that is

1074
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,400
not not appearing to be too purposeful

1075
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
and you continue up and up the branch

1076
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,520
choosing the higher

1077
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,640
branch each time until you get to these

1078
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
first and second order predictions and

1079
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,280
higher order recursive logics

1080
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
which are seen as higher and higher

1081
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,760
levels of purpose

1082
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,078
cool do you have any thoughts sarah

1083
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,960
okay uh daniel do you want to take this

1084
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,119
one

1085
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,640
what is an individual well there's so

1086
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,280
many

1087
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,320
ways to go about this and as a ant

1088
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,200
researcher

1089
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,599
that's always the debate like okay is

1090
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,560
the individual

1091
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,800
the six-legged next mate and then that

1092
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
makes the colony like a society or a

1093
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,240
super individual

1094
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,040
or is the colony the individual and then

1095
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,119
the nest mate is like the tissue

1096
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
so there's a lot of discussion around

1097
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
what constitutes an individual

1098
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,440
and how would you determine where the

1099
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,800
boundaries of individual

1100
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,040
individuality are and that

1101
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
piece i just referenced about

1102
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
establishing the bounds

1103
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,240
can be done in a few different ways one

1104
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,440
of them would be

1105
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,000
looking at where information theory is

1106
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,560
um

1107
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
strongest or where information flows are

1108
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
occurring that's the information theory

1109
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
of individuality

1110
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
and here we're going to take a cognitive

1111
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
perspective on

1112
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,720
individuation and mccollum

1113
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
is quoted so early in the neural network

1114
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
days

1115
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,119
the definition in the paper is i propose

1116
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
a definition of an individual

1117
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,200
based upon its information processing

1118
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,160
structure

1119
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
the scales and types of goals that a

1120
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,599
system can pursue

1121
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,079
defines slash determines the boundaries

1122
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,680
and contents of the putative

1123
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,280
agent so it's an informational lens

1124
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,160
on what constitutes an individual like

1125
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,119
we can say that

1126
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,200
individual people become maybe an

1127
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
individual mob

1128
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,079
just one mob not multiple mobs when they

1129
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:28,880
start

1130
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
integrating information differently or

1131
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
when they start pursuing

1132
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,599
different kinds of goals in a different

1133
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,760
way and it touches on these big

1134
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,720
questions like

1135
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,040
why does it matter how we define

1136
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,079
individual

1137
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
as well as what other ways of thinking

1138
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,480
about individuality exists

1139
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,200
yeah it's intense right so not only like

1140
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
in the information theory of

1141
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
individuality is it like the

1142
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
the most concentrated information but

1143
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,760
it's also like that bi-directional

1144
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,800
information flow right it was is how uh

1145
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
krakow and that group the defined

1146
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,480
individuality in that paper and so

1147
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,240
that's super interesting to me like at

1148
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,520
what point

1149
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,440
is there downward causation in an

1150
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,280
aggregate like

1151
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,440
so it's at at that point that is that is

1152
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,320
like the the

1153
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,880
the crux for how they um talked about

1154
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
individuality which is i mean it makes

1155
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
sense to me right like you know my

1156
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,640
my brain tells my foot to kick the ball

1157
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
or i decide i want to kick the ball and

1158
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
so my body then acts accordingly but

1159
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,760
it's um

1160
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,599
it's really interesting to think about

1161
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,760
when that when that hap

1162
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,839
emerges that downward causation in a

1163
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,960
system anyway

1164
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
something i think a lot about probably

1165
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,800
too much

1166
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,160
what about you tara

1167
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,640
yeah that is actually one of the few

1168
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,720
papers i actually have read and i like

1169
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,320
went with a highlighter and everything

1170
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,520
um and i i always wonder on

1171
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
on i was looking through the math on

1172
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
that and i actually learned a lot about

1173
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,200
like that i didn't even think was was

1174
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
possible yet

1175
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,880
but it was it was binary in a sense it

1176
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
was digital

1177
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,839
and and i'm never clear about when that

1178
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,359
matters and when it doesn't in these

1179
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,880
kinds of

1180
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
models so that's one thing that came up

1181
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,599
for me

1182
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,599
sounds good next

1183
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,040
no no it's not the sims it's

1184
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,079
um a cone of individuation

1185
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
and in 2a is um

1186
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,359
this sort of like cone-based

1187
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,720
representation of

1188
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
individuality that's going to be

1189
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,880
returning in a few different guises in

1190
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,160
the paper

1191
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,680
and on the plane going out in different

1192
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,640
directions

1193
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,280
from a central point is like the zone of

1194
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
influence

1195
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,960
or the extent of the system's ability to

1196
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,240
perceive act plan and then

1197
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,720
piercing that coming up and down in the

1198
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,839
c dimension

1199
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,880
is going from the past to the future and

1200
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,400
so

1201
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,520
this is a cool way to look at how

1202
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
multi-scale systems or

1203
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,280
what are called compound intelligences

1204
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
compound intelligences

1205
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,040
down there on the bottom right exist so

1206
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
we can use this kind of a

1207
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
cone representation or um to

1208
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
look at single cognitive agents and

1209
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,079
potentially contrast them

1210
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,119
like in part b where we have a tick

1211
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,200
with what's hypothesized to be like a

1212
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
smaller scope

1213
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,960
spatially in the now as well as a

1214
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,040
shorter temporal scope in the past and

1215
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,160
future

1216
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,200
compare tick with a human and then also

1217
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,880
ask maybe about what kinds of other

1218
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,839
cognitive forms exist and then these

1219
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,359
cones can be composed

1220
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,000
really nicely so like on the example on

1221
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
the bottom right with an

1222
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,079
ant colony again controversial to say

1223
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,599
that the ant is the organism

1224
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,960
when potentially the colony is the

1225
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,560
organism that's why i usually call them

1226
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,680
an estimate

1227
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,880
but we can see how the nest mates are

1228
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,960
inside of the colony within this cone

1229
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
and so the colony pushes out the

1230
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
boundaries

1231
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,200
of what these ants can do so they're

1232
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,800
kind of like on different parts of the

1233
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,680
spatial plane

1234
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
in the current moment and then the

1235
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,920
colony is something that is cognitively

1236
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,560
able to

1237
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
move beyond the time horizon of an

1238
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,319
individual nest mate

1239
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,240
by virtue of its collective organization

1240
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,598
and information processing

1241
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
this is cool and something that we like

1242
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,400
talked about a lot like offline in

1243
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,560
preparation for this and preparing the

1244
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,839
slides is like the

1245
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,520
inversion of the um the typical like

1246
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,280
light cone so

1247
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
maybe daniel you want to walk us through

1248
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,200
this light cone and then we can

1249
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,560
maybe go back to the other one yeah so

1250
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,920
this is a similar light cone

1251
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,400
notion and it's just that instead of

1252
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,200
having um

1253
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,760
the two cups you know meeting mouth to

1254
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,880
mouth and then

1255
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,440
becoming pinched off in small time

1256
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,079
another

1257
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,599
way that light cones have been

1258
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,000
represented is actually with the current

1259
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,880
moment

1260
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
like the eye of the needle you know like

1261
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
a hourglass the pinch point

1262
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,319
and then in the past and in the future

1263
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,359
are the uh set of states

1264
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,160
that influence a given point and then

1265
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
the set of states it influences

1266
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
so let's like think about that butterfly

1267
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,359
flapping its wings

1268
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,000
in the here and now so if you go back

1269
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,640
one time

1270
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,560
step the air molecules that might

1271
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
influence it are like

1272
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,319
one layer of air molecule away and as

1273
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,319
you go back and back and back

1274
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,280
more and more spatial extents matters

1275
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,880
for the state of the butterfly in the

1276
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,440
moment

1277
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,359
and then similarly one time step in the

1278
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,680
future the butterflies flapping

1279
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,960
is only able to influence a small zone

1280
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
proximal to the insect whereas further

1281
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,839
and further out into the future

1282
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,160
more and more spatial extents might be

1283
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,920
modified because of the actions that

1284
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
happen in the here and now

1285
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
and then this is a leecors cabinet uh

1286
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
you know joke on the liquor cabinet but

1287
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,200
it's a

1288
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,079
paper that actually uses this kind of an

1289
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:06,800
approach

1290
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,000
to do modeling of empirical data

1291
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,680
and to fit machine learning models which

1292
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,520
we can talk about

1293
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,520
uh going forward like why and how

1294
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
do you get a speed up of certain kinds

1295
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,880
of simulations or data fitting

1296
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,119
by approaching it like a light cone

1297
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,440
so it's just interesting the axis here

1298
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,040
like and this is kind of how i'm used to

1299
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,319
seeing these represented are

1300
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,280
time and space right so like in physical

1301
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,800
space i am

1302
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
physically in this space that i am at

1303
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,079
right now

1304
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,480
and it's interesting as like you know as

1305
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,839
you go forward in time

1306
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,319
like you know given enough like hours i

1307
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,000
could theoretically like fly from new

1308
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,440
mexico to singapore

1309
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,359
but like for right now i mean i'm kind

1310
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,520
of limited to like my house or my block

1311
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,960
or you know like i don't have like

1312
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,400
point-to-point transport

1313
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,800
so i always like the the way that um

1314
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,599
mike represents this light cone like in

1315
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,680
this way like in the inverse

1316
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,160
it's it's like time and space and and

1317
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,960
you know it gets

1318
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,400
it starts in a very broad space and it

1319
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,680
proceeds to a very

1320
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,160
narrow space and it's like of course in

1321
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,560
the past like if i go to my distant past

1322
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,760
like i came out of an

1323
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,319
egg that was in my mother's uterus right

1324
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,119
like so

1325
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,800
or in my mother's womb like that's where

1326
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,720
i came from i was in that one point

1327
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,119
and i've gone all kinds of places i

1328
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,960
guess until now but i'm not i don't feel

1329
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,079
like i'm many places

1330
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,319
now and and i also don't feel like i'm

1331
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,520
going to be many places

1332
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,359
in the future so i'm interested to to

1333
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,359
talk to mike when he comes onto the

1334
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,240
live stream about um the way that this

1335
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,040
is represented

1336
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,119
because it's very different you guys

1337
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,160
have any more thoughts on that

1338
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,000
yeah i have one um i mean it seems to me

1339
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,240
he's almost trying to do

1340
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,680
he's almost trying to take the case of

1341
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,560
the light cone and look at a particular

1342
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,040
ambition that you might have at this

1343
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,240
point in time

1344
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,800
and then and then can you carry out that

1345
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
ambition through time and as you get

1346
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,079
further and further you realize there's

1347
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,440
all these impediments

1348
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,280
you know that that come in your way and

1349
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,960
so it's this like

1350
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
one axis is the ability to envision

1351
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,240
um what it is you want to do and the

1352
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,480
other act yes this is the ability to

1353
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,200
enact it

1354
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,680
is the ability to well even control or

1355
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,160
whatever your environment any number of

1356
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
things that are required to enact uh

1357
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
this this vision that you have

1358
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,200
and that's an interesting interesting

1359
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,480
access transformation

1360
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,400
agreed um the light cone where the

1361
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,359
uh that looks more like an hourglass is

1362
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,800
kind of related to

1363
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,359
our limited degrees of freedom in the

1364
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,960
current moment

1365
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,200
but it you know expanding out into the

1366
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
future of what we can influence and then

1367
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,920
the the diamond shape that we see in

1368
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,280
figure two

1369
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
is more like our zone of what can be

1370
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,119
cognized

1371
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,880
which goes beyond what we can influence

1372
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,160
in the current moment

1373
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,839
because there's some future time when

1374
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,680
you won't be able to imagine

1375
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,240
you know you know as as the the curtains

1376
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,760
close on life

1377
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,319
and it narrows in and it's like smaller

1378
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,280
and smaller

1379
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,800
and then there's some point where your

1380
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,119
capacity to influence is actually

1381
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,240
kind of toned out and so there are two

1382
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
complementary ways to look at

1383
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,200
the same thing although it's interesting

1384
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,160
i want to say because

1385
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,760
you know like you look at like there

1386
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,440
could be some inner super meaning or

1387
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,119
intervening thing where it actually

1388
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,800
helps you that you never considered in

1389
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
this in this cone of possibility so you

1390
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,200
become wider like really it's just this

1391
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,040
the winding road right

1392
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,160
for sure

1393
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,920
all right moving on let's go to 28. this

1394
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,440
is sort of taking the light cone

1395
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,760
there's just one and a half more slides

1396
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,359
that take the light cone in a little bit

1397
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,240
of a different

1398
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,880
more physical direction but again it's

1399
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,440
it's all

1400
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
part of a continued conversation so we

1401
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,000
can look at the now

1402
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,880
that's the middle of those three layers

1403
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,839
where there's two

1404
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,040
different uh like individuals you know

1405
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,240
sally and uh you know friend n

1406
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,920
so it's like two of those are at

1407
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,760
different points now

1408
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,359
and so then we look over on the time

1409
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,200
cone on the right and so agent

1410
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
n is you know nick that's the one that

1411
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,240
we're focusing on

1412
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,280
and now the same time they're

1413
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,960
at the same moment but they're in

1414
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,400
different points in space

1415
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,280
and so from the point of view of n s is

1416
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,960
a space-like

1417
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,640
uh point but then

1418
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,000
in the same spot in the future or the

1419
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,480
past

1420
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,280
f or p in the same location you know the

1421
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,079
same address

1422
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,400
20 minutes ago is type like in the same

1423
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,480
address 20 minutes in the future is also

1424
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,319
time-like but then on the edges of this

1425
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,040
cone is like light which i i don't know

1426
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,559
the physics behind but i think it's kind

1427
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,000
of a cool idea

1428
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,200
that space and time have this

1429
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,760
boundary nature and that there's things

1430
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,240
that are

1431
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,119
more space-like like things that are

1432
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,880
instantaneously at the same moment but

1433
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,000
in different spaces

1434
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,480
and more time like the pure case being

1435
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
the same location at a different time

1436
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,040
but then it's like i'll meet you in 20

1437
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,960
minutes two blocks away

1438
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
that's like moving through both space

1439
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,000
and time

1440
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,160
and maybe light does that in a kind of

1441
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,440
unique way

1442
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,680
so that was just one um way that in

1443
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,200
relativity

1444
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,280
that they talk about light cones and

1445
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,200
indeed the light cone concept is a

1446
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,720
is a physicist's concept

1447
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,040
that's really cool to think about like

1448
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,920
that

1449
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,240
light is the boundary between space and

1450
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,160
time

1451
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,599
that's kind of a neat thought yes

1452
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,680
and then on 29 i just wanted to pull one

1453
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,240
again

1454
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,440
the details going beyond me

1455
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,960
and this discussion but

1456
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,640
here in a recent paper that explored how

1457
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,440
you could do

1458
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,079
simulations using light cones and so

1459
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,400
this is not just like sort of a

1460
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,240
metaphor or a cognitive heuristic this

1461
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,920
is something that you can use for large

1462
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,559
scale

1463
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,839
data analysis and so the way which i

1464
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,280
alluded to earlier

1465
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,000
in which you can speed up a simulation

1466
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,880
potentially

1467
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,680
by using a delight cone is by having a

1468
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,680
point that you're focusing on

1469
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,079
and then you only need to consider one

1470
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,000
time point in the past at a radius of

1471
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,280
one spatially

1472
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,119
two time points in the past a radius of

1473
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,400
two spatially

1474
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
three to three out and so it helps you

1475
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,559
reduce the space of what you need to

1476
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,520
calculate

1477
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,880
from all versus all to the idea of

1478
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,599
calculating

1479
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,000
more and more out in more and more past

1480
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,720
steps and

1481
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,240
more and more out as you go into the

1482
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,480
future um

1483
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,960
so that's because in the physical

1484
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,079
interpretation

1485
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,480
there's a speed of propagation through a

1486
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,280
media

1487
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,040
so things don't happen instantaneously

1488
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,880
so that's like the light

1489
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
moving through a media at speed of light

1490
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,800
and then in the case of information

1491
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,680
propagation

1492
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,839
it's similar like if you wanted to focus

1493
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:14,880
on a given person

1494
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,400
and their role on an informational

1495
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,640
network you would maybe make like an

1496
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,520
informational

1497
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,680
cone instead of needing to calculate all

1498
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,960
by all at every single

1499
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,760
time steps and so it just made us

1500
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,559
curious

1501
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,960
about how active inference related to

1502
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,920
light cones

1503
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,599
so how can we apply this to some of the

1504
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,440
simulation models that we've already

1505
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,640
seen

1506
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,280
and then just you know what does the

1507
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,920
past

1508
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,520
of the light cone represent what is the

1509
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,599
current moment what's the future

1510
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,760
just fun eternal questions

1511
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,400
cool ah that's so so i made this slide

1512
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,359
this is funny this

1513
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,680
light cone i actually showed um when i

1514
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,720
gave a seminar

1515
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
at mike levin's lab a couple years ago

1516
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,920
it's from

1517
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,400
um andrew gallimore's paper uh

1518
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,839
restructuring consciousness the

1519
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,440
psychedelic state in the light of

1520
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,160
integrated

1521
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
information theory but i was thinking

1522
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,440
about this in terms of

1523
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,599
shrinking and expanding the boundary of

1524
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,599
the self which the author discusses a

1525
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,280
lot in the paper here

1526
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,240
um and just like how that would change

1527
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,720
your

1528
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,559
effective light cone right like so if

1529
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,240
you have you have your

1530
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,040
your self boundary it's like a a limited

1531
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,559
like cone like the darker one that's

1532
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,079
shown in this figure on the right

1533
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,680
and if you expand the boundary of

1534
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,359
yourself it expands your light cone so

1535
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,640
it made me think of that as we were

1536
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,319
talking as he was talking as mike was

1537
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,520
talking about the

1538
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,119
um shrinking and expanding the boundary

1539
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,559
of the self in the paper

1540
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,079
and so i'm really curious here's a

1541
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,640
couple quotes from the paper about um

1542
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
boundary establishment and maintenance

1543
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,839
so he

1544
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,640
says the surrounding body becomes an

1545
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,839
informational shield

1546
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,079
or markov blanket for the stem cell and

1547
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,000
this is he references carl firsten's

1548
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,839
2013 paper

1549
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,920
um and so i wonder about like the markov

1550
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,559
blanket

1551
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,160
and i think that you know daniel this is

1552
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,520
something you and i have talked about as

1553
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,079
well

1554
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,160
about the markov blanket like being the

1555
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,200
defining

1556
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,400
boundary for the individual and like how

1557
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,200
i mean things must pop in and out of a

1558
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,400
markov blanket

1559
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,480
right like if i think about the cells

1560
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,079
that are in my skin

1561
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,480
layer right like i mean i'm losing them

1562
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,000
all the time and new ones are constantly

1563
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,839
being added so there's no

1564
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,280
distinct hard line to be drawn

1565
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,680
so like under like how do things pop in

1566
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,359
and out of a markov blanket like

1567
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,440
and what do you can you like just have

1568
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,480
like peripheral

1569
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,119
boundary nodes on the edges there like

1570
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,720
i've talked before also about like the

1571
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,160
difference between like your fingernail

1572
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,200
and your cuticle

1573
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,760
like there's like a a small tiny layer

1574
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,880
that doesn't know whether it's a

1575
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,400
fingernail or a cuticle

1576
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,480
so it's like how do you like have these

1577
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,599
like boundaries

1578
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
right um anyway another quote from the

1579
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,880
paper

1580
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,760
crucially by organizing into a partial

1581
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,720
electrochemical

1582
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,319
and informational pool or sync to

1583
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,839
tm sinks somebody say that for me please

1584
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
syncidium syncidium there we go

1585
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,079
all of the cells are able to measure and

1586
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,680
detect events occurring

1587
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,839
within the same boundary creating a

1588
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,040
larger individual

1589
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
that emerges from the collective and i

1590
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,319
think this quote was like in

1591
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,280
in reference to the gap junctions and

1592
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,280
how they expand that electrochemical

1593
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,000
pool by like

1594
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,400
they open up like some like they pull

1595
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,559
the plug on the electrochemical gradient

1596
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:29,200
and so it

1597
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,079
kind of enables this like cell linkage

1598
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:32,800
so that's one

1599
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,079
one way that um you know

1600
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,280
boundaries are maybe established but

1601
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,400
any thoughts on this guys

1602
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,440
we'll come back to it i think i have a

1603
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,280
few thoughts on where the markov

1604
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,040
blankets come into play through time

1605
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,559
cool all right

1606
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,520
uh so homeostasis which we we promised

1607
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,880
to come back to so

1608
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,119
what evolutionary pressures led

1609
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,720
cognitive boundaries to the

1610
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,040
to expand this is from the paper and the

1611
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,720
author proposes that the atom

1612
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,839
of this cognitive hierarchy is

1613
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,400
homeostasis

1614
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,040
um so reactive homeostasis evolves into

1615
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,200
predictive allostasis

1616
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,960
under the pressure to predict signals

1617
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,240
from the environment and

1618
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,160
other elements of the biosphere and

1619
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,200
that's like what i was talking about

1620
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,000
earlier about

1621
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,960
the first like counter factual about um

1622
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
you know what if it's not always 76

1623
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,520
degrees

1624
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,119
and full of nutrients in my environment

1625
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,799
how can i regulate that reduce my

1626
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,880
uncertainty about future availability of

1627
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,400
the supplies that i need

1628
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,799
and also there's this um nice

1629
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:37,520
progression

1630
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,160
from homeostasis so that's sort of like

1631
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,280
similar

1632
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,920
you know same homeostasis it's the

1633
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,680
thermometer is trying to get within

1634
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,720
the bound but the best way to stay

1635
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,839
within the bounds

1636
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,599
when the environment is changing is

1637
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,960
actually to not just be

1638
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,079
reactive but to be proactive or

1639
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,040
predictive and then what's the best way

1640
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,760
to be

1641
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,319
proactive well it's to have increasingly

1642
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,119
rich

1643
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,599
generative models of the niche if you

1644
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,200
know that night time is coming

1645
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,880
you're going to be able to take really

1646
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,520
good predictive behavior

1647
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,440
right now for tonight if you know that

1648
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,880
winter is coming at a

1649
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,760
larger time scale it's another level of

1650
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,280
you being able to make adaptive

1651
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,240
decisions

1652
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,760
so what looks like homeostasis sometimes

1653
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,880
can actually just be very uh

1654
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,780
skillful predictive allostasis

1655
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,819
[Music]

1656
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,440
do you have any thoughts sarah on that

1657
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,720
cool um

1658
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,760
okay so this one is memory and scale

1659
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,880
free cognition and

1660
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,720
active inference um so

1661
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,799
i don't know i just had some thoughts

1662
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,920
here like memory

1663
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,079
in as a gene regulatory network and this

1664
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,440
is kind of something that

1665
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
not really was stated in this paper but

1666
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,960
really like

1667
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,799
you know it's it's our evolutionary

1668
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,960
memory of like where we've been before

1669
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,079
and how we've um come to

1670
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,799
regulate and you know work within our

1671
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,000
environmental condition

1672
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,799
and like also memory is a process like i

1673
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:15,440
don't know

1674
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,160
i think about that like where is it

1675
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,400
stored is it externalized into the niche

1676
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,240
like we do a lot of niche modification

1677
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,520
and so

1678
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,839
i don't know um it's interesting to

1679
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:26,559
think about

1680
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,680
our our ram and our rom in um

1681
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,960
in like a biological sense so

1682
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,040
it's the author says a second step in

1683
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,799
the simplest homeostatic loop is the

1684
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,640
inclusion of a richer set of hidden

1685
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,559
layers in the neural network sense

1686
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,319
so these are additional biochemical

1687
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,400
nodes between sensors and effectors of a

1688
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,319
given system that enable a degree of

1689
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,839
memory

1690
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,160
and importantly memory can serve as the

1691
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,520
beginning of modularity

1692
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,960
because learning essentially groups

1693
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,799
diverse stimuli into compressed

1694
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,240
representations

1695
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,920
complex states of affairs become

1696
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,280
remembered as compact

1697
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,760
biophysical engrams this is the essence

1698
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,440
of the kind of modularity when a simple

1699
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,119
biophysical event kicks off the

1700
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,799
formation of a complex

1701
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,799
morphogenetic cascades such as building

1702
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,480
a hand in embryogenesis

1703
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,440
one nice point there is the difference

1704
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,280
between modularity

1705
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,160
and memory about how they enable each

1706
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,720
other

1707
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,040
it's sort of like if everything is being

1708
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,079
mixed in one

1709
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,000
cup there can't be a memory of different

1710
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,599
colors okay well if you have two

1711
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,799
separated cups

1712
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,359
you can remember two different colors

1713
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,240
and so on

1714
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,799
so memory can serve as the beginning of

1715
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:35,680
modularity

1716
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,319
is saying that it's this um relationship

1717
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,720
between things becoming distinct

1718
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,880
and being remembered through time

1719
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
distinctness carried through time

1720
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,520
is memory you can remember a longer

1721
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,400
number

1722
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,599
when you have more modularity that's

1723
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,480
being propagated through time

1724
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,280
and then the paper on the right is um a

1725
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,839
an

1726
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,680
older first in paper talking about

1727
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,599
memory attention and salience and active

1728
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,400
inference

1729
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,880
where they described uh memory working

1730
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,160
memory as

1731
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,480
a process of evidence accumulation in a

1732
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,480
temporarily structured hierarchy

1733
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,240
so i guess like going back through deep

1734
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,000
time like that's where the gene

1735
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,480
regulatory network kind of comes in

1736
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,960
as a process right like the process of

1737
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,839
evolution

1738
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,000
as and that's like the working memory

1739
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,520
there anyway

1740
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,359
and just you have one one note there on

1741
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,799
the multi-scale active inference models

1742
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,119
sometimes the way that memory is being

1743
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,960
modeled inactive inference

1744
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,599
is as a state variable that changes at a

1745
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:36,160
slower

1746
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,680
rate and so within the longer

1747
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,920
time scale model we have a shorter time

1748
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,040
scale model

1749
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,520
and then that can be modeled from

1750
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,559
setting to setting

1751
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,960
as memory carrying over and so it

1752
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,559
relates to this idea that

1753
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,680
the larger cognitive system is able to

1754
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,400
also act over longer time scales as well

1755
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,520
as reach back

1756
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,480
with a deeper memory because if you have

1757
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,599
the kind of

1758
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,200
short-term model that's just stand-alone

1759
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,720
it doesn't it's like a memory-less

1760
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,119
process but if that has inherited

1761
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,520
from a hierarchical model the state from

1762
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,839
a previous

1763
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,079
um click of the model it's memory

1764
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,760
and then if it's able to imagine one

1765
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,359
more click out into the future

1766
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,680
it's goal planning it's anticipation and

1767
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,760
so inactive inference

1768
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,960
one of the ways that we integrate memory

1769
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,920
and planning together is by thinking

1770
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,480
about

1771
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,520
hierarchically nested models so also i

1772
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,839
wonder what role memory plays in

1773
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,799
policy selection like i remember every

1774
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:39,520
summer

1775
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,799
when i go to scotland it is

1776
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,520
cold like i mean i live in new mexico

1777
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,799
it's like 120 degrees here

1778
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,040
fahrenheit so every time every summer i

1779
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,200
remember that when i go to scotland it's

1780
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,119
cold so now it's my policy

1781
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,680
to bring a jacket when i go right so

1782
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,040
even though it's the summer time and i

1783
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,480
wouldn't normally do that so

1784
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,440
is that memory also ever modeled in the

1785
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,720
policy selection daniel

1786
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,880
it's a good question like i wonder if

1787
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,280
you can

1788
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,520
plan to forget or you know i'll make a

1789
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,480
note i'll plan to remember

1790
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,799
i'd say active inference just gives us a

1791
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:17,599
way to

1792
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,720
think about all those different

1793
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,559
affordances that real cognitive systems

1794
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,359
have like

1795
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,559
offloading memory to the niche through

1796
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,160
external computation or in terms of what

1797
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:28,480
you

1798
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,319
just described but that's a good

1799
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,160
question we can ask

1800
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,520
right i don't actually even need to

1801
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,040
remember that it's cold in scotland

1802
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,359
because you know i can just ask google

1803
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,720
they will tell me the weather and it

1804
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,240
will be cold in scotland so if i just

1805
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,280
remember to

1806
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,200
you know check my cognitive offloading

1807
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,640
device

1808
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,920
then i don't even need to remember to

1809
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,920
break a jacket when i go so

1810
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,040
yep okay

1811
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,880
next so i figure i have one i have one

1812
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,240
random thought maybe it comes up in

1813
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
another slide but is this question that

1814
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,000
michael levin has about how does it know

1815
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
when to stop in terms of um

1816
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,640
cell growth and morphogenesis if it's

1817
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,319
the case that it's connected to memory

1818
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:08,640
in the way that he's suggesting then

1819
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,119
yeah you know like maybe if it related

1820
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,079
the information flow

1821
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,920
i guess that may be obvious given the

1822
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,280
focus of this

1823
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,319
um but it is interesting you know it's

1824
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,119
like

1825
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,440
the the cells are just like we've got

1826
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,559
we've got to

1827
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,760
now become multi-body you know

1828
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,839
or become social rather than individual

1829
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,520
in order to store memory like there's a

1830
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,319
funny like

1831
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,400
break point yeah i didn't see the stop

1832
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,000
mechanism really brought up

1833
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,680
in this paper but i have seen it so

1834
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,559
um i'm not really sure where it ties in

1835
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,880
here

1836
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,680
um figure three

1837
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,599
i mean i mean if he calls it a

1838
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,440
morphogenic cascade you know it's like

1839
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,880
well we're

1840
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,200
we we we're born we grow we grow to a

1841
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,799
certain point and then we shrivel and

1842
01:02:58,799 --> 01:02:59,200
die

1843
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,119
so it's like how does that connect to

1844
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,720
memory and information

1845
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,160
ah it's kind of suggested

1846
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,920
yep so figure three

1847
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,440
is looking at a sort of cell's eye

1848
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,480
view of that time cone

1849
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,160
and now we're going to step away from

1850
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,760
you know is it a time diamond or is the

1851
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,480
time going

1852
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,000
and we're going to think about the

1853
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,559
trajectory of a given cell

1854
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,319
go back to the assumptions of the paper

1855
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,240
though this isn't about whether the cell

1856
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,079
is experiencing things it's not

1857
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,799
what it's like to be a cell it's about

1858
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:33,119
how

1859
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,880
the cell has a given spatial extent in a

1860
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,799
it has a given spatial extent that can

1861
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,720
be thought of as having a memory

1862
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,039
it inherits a history through time and

1863
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,400
then also has

1864
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,920
an anticipation zone in the future

1865
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,359
then it can do anticipation of memory

1866
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,640
as a sole agent or it can interact

1867
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,599
socially

1868
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,520
so what happens when it interacts

1869
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,200
socially with other agents

1870
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,280
like itself well it expands the spatial

1871
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,559
dimension in the now that's what's being

1872
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:06,880
called

1873
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,680
integrated spatial perception and that

1874
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,720
allows it to

1875
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,359
have expanded memory in the past like if

1876
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,240
each of your

1877
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,880
five friends have a book then there's

1878
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,640
more memory as a group because there's

1879
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,680
more books

1880
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,079
and then also the ability to extend the

1881
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,200
anticipation

1882
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,359
into the future and then this part i

1883
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,520
just highlighted in blue

1884
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,160
is joining into communication networks

1885
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,760
allows the cell to have

1886
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,079
temporally delayed access to the

1887
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,680
information obtained by neighboring

1888
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,480
cells

1889
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,240
this is where the time cone comes into

1890
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,720
play it's not that when something is

1891
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,440
perceived

1892
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,440
um by one of these cells off on the

1893
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,559
fringe

1894
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,119
the vocal cell doesn't instantly hear

1895
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:47,760
about it

1896
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,119
they hear about it one time step later

1897
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,200
so that's where the times the time cone

1898
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,799
comes into play

1899
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,280
because from the point of view of this

1900
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,160
focal cell

1901
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,240
just assuming that um information moves

1902
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,119
one cell per unit of time

1903
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,240
then at zero time points its

1904
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,599
radius is one one time point away

1905
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,400
its ability to integrate sense is one

1906
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,280
more radius

1907
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,520
away and so you can keep on clicking

1908
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,760
back and that's reflecting a broader and

1909
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,520
broader zone of memory

1910
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,920
or you can carry it forward with a

1911
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,559
broader broader zone of influences or

1912
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,359
states that it can affect and so the

1913
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,559
reason the resulting

1914
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,760
larger individual and again individual

1915
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,839
is being used cognitively here not like

1916
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,720
evolutionarily is formed with a

1917
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,480
cognitive world that's unified

1918
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,400
by the cells sharing of information

1919
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,240
across time and space

1920
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,280
so no teleportation and no time

1921
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,640
travel the limitations of propagation of

1922
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,440
information

1923
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,079
in our physical universe means that from

1924
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,000
the point of any given cell

1925
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,640
or agent it's existing in this time

1926
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,598
cone-like structure

1927
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,520
yeah that was like the expanding the

1928
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,160
boundary of the self um

1929
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,920
and like kind of like what happens like

1930
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,680
the time cone is expanded and you know

1931
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,960
what this just makes me think of well

1932
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,599
first

1933
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,039
i just want to remind everyone that this

1934
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,640
like cell cell communication

1935
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,119
is like what is what gap junctions

1936
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,400
facilitate because they're

1937
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,920
really connecting all cells and solid

1938
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,319
tissues um but but really i thought

1939
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:20,880
about

1940
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,799
you know the old adage that you are your

1941
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,119
company and like if you think about you

1942
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,520
know your five like closest friends

1943
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,760
and that like communication like network

1944
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,960
that you have like you

1945
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,039
hear about you know world events or

1946
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,000
events that

1947
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,760
are relevant to their lives it might be

1948
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,599
relevant to you like you hear about it

1949
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,240
one time step later and just how like

1950
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,520
you know your cognitive

1951
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,079
like boundary is expanded by like your

1952
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:44,960
inner circle

1953
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,000
i don't know made me think of that

1954
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,960
yep hey blue can you just can you just

1955
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,079
re-highlight or

1956
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,160
talk about the cell uh cell exemption

1957
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,440
that you're just mentioning

1958
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,359
oh yeah so that was earlier in the talk

1959
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,880
it was one of the key words so let me

1960
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,559
just go back to that slide

1961
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,559
um so here uh these gap junctions

1962
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,799
so they they are they were originally

1963
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,000
you know categorized

1964
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,960
in like neural tissue and uh in muscle

1965
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,680
you know

1966
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,000
to facilitate like rapid communication

1967
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,079
but they're really present in every cell

1968
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,839
in solid tissue and they they just

1969
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,720
perform um not ion exchange but it's

1970
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,480
like passive diffusion of ions

1971
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,200
so that it's like almost a shared

1972
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,960
intercellular space

1973
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,319
so would it be

1974
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,480
safe to call that a kind of a

1975
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,440
information

1976
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,640
bottleneck i just wonder so maybe not as

1977
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,839
much of a bottleneck as it is like

1978
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:44,000
um it pokes a hole in the informational

1979
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,079
boundary

1980
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,559
yeah okay so that it's more the more

1981
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:49,359
rapidly

1982
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,760
let's just say that the gap junction so

1983
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,599
the no gap junction

1984
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,240
it moves like um takes three time steps

1985
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,839
for the signal you know one time step to

1986
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,440
release the molecule one for it to

1987
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,000
diffuse

1988
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,319
one for it to be perceived so every

1989
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,760
three units a time

1990
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,520
you're getting a radius expanding out by

1991
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
one now let's just say that a gap

1992
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,640
junction allows

1993
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,440
one time step the direct diffusion so

1994
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,000
then

1995
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,200
the time cone is expanding wider

1996
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,359
because the diffusion from the target

1997
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,279
cell is able to sweep

1998
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,080
out a larger time cone whereas if again

1999
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,000
if it took three units of time for every

2000
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,880
one of diffusion it'd be like a narrower

2001
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,839
time cup

2002
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,560
so rap communication which is never

2003
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,600
instant

2004
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,560
allows that time cone to access more

2005
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,359
memory

2006
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,640
into the present and then influence

2007
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,600
more broadly and so bottleneck is sort

2008
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,120
of like thinking like a bottleneck is a

2009
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,158
constraint

2010
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,880
relative to the width of the bottle but

2011
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,359
in the

2012
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,120
context of a gap junction it's actually

2013
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,799
like a channel or an opening for

2014
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,960
information transmission

2015
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,560
so what do you think i'm just i'm just

2016
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,080
gonna go ahead

2017
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,839
if you think about it in terms of like

2018
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,560
your um inner circle of friends

2019
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,080
imagine like you can wait for your

2020
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,759
friend to call you up and tell you this

2021
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,600
exciting new event or like you can have

2022
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,479
a wire tap

2023
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,640
into their house so like the gap

2024
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,479
junction is like having a wire tap into

2025
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,319
their house so like you always know like

2026
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,439
what is going on

2027
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,880
right okay

2028
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,719
i'm also searching for another analogy

2029
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,399
that's just saying into the stuff i've

2030
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,759
been looking at lately do you think it's

2031
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:22,640
fair that

2032
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,000
analysis to um you know a compression

2033
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,799
function

2034
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,479
like you know if you picture the classic

2035
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:29,839
neural net you know a bunch of notes

2036
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,198
here just a few in the center of the

2037
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,960
hidden layer and then expanded out would

2038
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,158
would it better be a fair analogy for a

2039
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,120
jet gap junction

2040
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,600
yeah i'm not seeing it sorry okay

2041
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,920
okay i would just uh to recover it i

2042
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,120
would just say

2043
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,640
that the transmission is like a

2044
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,319
compressed form

2045
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,319
of it's like a little sampling of the

2046
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,000
chemical milieu from one cell being

2047
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,360
passed to the other

2048
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,920
if there was no bottleneck no

2049
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,360
compression of information

2050
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,440
they would be just in one unit there'd

2051
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,600
be in one markov blanket

2052
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,760
and so there's this trade-off where if

2053
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,360
you totally isolate

2054
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
the rate of information propagation is

2055
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,239
low the modularity is very high though

2056
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,960
on the other hand with total integration

2057
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,560
you can't have memory

2058
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,480
because you don't have modularity

2059
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,600
however you do have

2060
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,760
instantaneous or close to that

2061
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,880
transmission

2062
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,280
and then the gap junction exists at this

2063
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,560
kind of sweet spot

2064
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,679
that allows for modularity with

2065
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,239
narrow channels of communication which

2066
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:32,800
is what

2067
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,640
shannon was studying in the first place

2068
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,920
cool so figure okay so figure three i

2069
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,600
think we just put popped on the cone is

2070
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,640
that true

2071
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,679
yeah that's just to draw the connection

2072
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,360
between the figure two with the

2073
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,000
the time diamond time cone and then just

2074
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,400
this

2075
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,159
figure cool okay

2076
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,320
figure four uh so

2077
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,560
figure three oh yeah well the the figure

2078
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,840
three the

2079
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,600
slide that we just had was like as

2080
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,440
things build out so that was the point

2081
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,960
of view of the agent building out and

2082
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,440
now it's like things fall apart

2083
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,520
so figure four we see a sort of

2084
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,719
rehearsal

2085
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,679
in b of what we saw previously which is

2086
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,199
that that target cell

2087
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,360
it's combining sensory information

2088
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,480
that's able

2089
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,560
enabling it to detect patterns more

2090
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,640
rapidly getting a big picture

2091
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,120
that's what it says in b and therefore

2092
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,440
missing information can be anticipated

2093
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,560
by this pattern

2094
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,120
seeking drive but what happens when

2095
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:35,600
things

2096
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,199
go wrong that's in c where this bottom

2097
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:39,679
right

2098
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,719
cell the green one has gone rogue

2099
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,920
it has stopped communicating in a way

2100
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,880
that was participating in this broader

2101
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,000
sense making

2102
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,520
and it has shrunk its sensory radius

2103
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,320
down

2104
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,000
and so in doing so it reduced the

2105
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,600
cognitive capacity

2106
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,320
of the other four cells it has reduced

2107
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,159
its own sphere of influence

2108
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,080
and it's also introduced this

2109
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,480
adversarial dynamic potentially

2110
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,640
over evolutionary or developmental time

2111
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,960
skills

2112
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,159
cool any more thoughts on that one

2113
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,960
reminds me of a friend i know but no

2114
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,360
other way

2115
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,440
it also reminds me about how cancer

2116
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,440
research is starting to think more about

2117
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,159
the niche

2118
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,760
and the signaling between cancer and

2119
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,679
non-cancer cells like cancer cells need

2120
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,560
to call down

2121
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,040
healthy blood vessels they need to

2122
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,679
prevent

2123
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,760
healthy immune response from taking them

2124
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,040
out and so

2125
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,080
it's like cancer as a dialectic or as a

2126
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,520
relationship

2127
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,840
between agents with different goals

2128
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,360
again not the experience

2129
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,679
of the goal but acting as if it has a

2130
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,400
goal that third person cybernetic

2131
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,840
teleology

2132
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,920
and so that helps us make sense of all

2133
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,679
these disparate features

2134
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,120
of cancer by thinking about internal and

2135
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,239
external states

2136
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,400
information propagation etc what do you

2137
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,239
think it would be right or off to think

2138
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,199
about the

2139
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,000
one possible place where that could go

2140
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,960
wrong

2141
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
um happening at the gap junction like

2142
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,640
the gap junction would no longer

2143
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,120
function as a good sampler compression

2144
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,159
thing which i know

2145
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,239
you don't agree with the analogy but

2146
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,199
something like that i

2147
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,360
like i i don't know what's happening in

2148
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,800
that research area but

2149
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,320
does that make any sense yeah we talked

2150
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,760
about gap junctions earlier and their

2151
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,480
involvement

2152
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,360
in um neoplasticity and all kinds of

2153
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,880
other disorders

2154
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,000
definitely i just found this really

2155
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,560
nice paper called gap junctions in

2156
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,199
cancer

2157
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,320
communicating for 50 years and it's the

2158
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,600
abstract starts with

2159
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,159
50 years ago tumor cells were found to

2160
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,239
lack electrical coupling

2161
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,080
leading to the hypothesis that loss of

2162
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,080
direct intracellular communication

2163
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,920
is commonly associated with cancer

2164
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,679
progression and onset

2165
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,159
so that's pretty interesting it's like

2166
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:02,800
when you

2167
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,960
shut down the lines of communication

2168
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,800
like between two countries

2169
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,320
are those two countries having an

2170
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,120
improving relationship or is that like

2171
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,000
the last time that they spoke before war

2172
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
so closing down the embassy

2173
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,080
shutting down the gap junction it

2174
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,440
doesn't bode well

2175
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,080
for a sort of amicable resolution to

2176
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,000
conflict or communication

2177
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,400
that's why it's so important to maintain

2178
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,880
the avenues of communication

2179
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,400
even when there is an adversarial

2180
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,760
relationship because things can always

2181
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,480
get worse

2182
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,239
you can always shut down the

2183
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,760
communication which will make the

2184
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,600
generative models and the incentives and

2185
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,159
the goals

2186
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:42,719
diverge even more

2187
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,679
cool i don't know just all of a sudden

2188
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:46,960
you go into politics and i'm like oh

2189
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,320
yeah but wait a minute

2190
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,239
anyway no but but we should shut down

2191
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,599
they're bad we should show

2192
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,520
if them keep the channel open you also

2193
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,280
stand more chance of injury

2194
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,320
by way of keeping the channel open so

2195
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,520
keep the channel open until you

2196
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,440
shouldn't um

2197
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,040
this is just um a fun uh discussion for

2198
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,600
a little bit

2199
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,239
on the evolutionary anachronism which

2200
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:12,880
means like

2201
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
uh just something that's happening at a

2202
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,000
different time

2203
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,679
than it's expected like a feature from

2204
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,199
the past that gets brought back

2205
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,400
like an evolutionary reversion

2206
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,920
and so in the paper it's described

2207
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,640
that uh this is a breakdown of

2208
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,000
multicellularity and highlights the fact

2209
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,440
that the scale of the structure which

2210
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,280
cells work to maintain can change

2211
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,400
rapidly

2212
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,480
cooperation towards an entire organ

2213
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,239
system or body

2214
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,320
that's a healthy organism to the level

2215
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,600
of a single cell

2216
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,360
so instead of seeing cancer just

2217
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,360
mechanistically as a derangement of

2218
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,880
signaling or derangement

2219
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,600
of replication and dna reproduce

2220
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,280
reproduction of a cell

2221
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,760
we can think about it informationally

2222
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,960
and cognitively

2223
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,000
and cybernetically like the cell has

2224
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
changed its cybernetic horizon

2225
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,719
from the goals of the organism to its

2226
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,880
own local goals

2227
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,600
and so this concept of an evolutionary

2228
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,880
anachronism and how

2229
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,760
even in the current day we can study

2230
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,280
anachronism

2231
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,080
uh in examples with avocados a tasty

2232
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,120
fruit

2233
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,600
and as per the wikipedia it says

2234
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,000
avocados are exceptionally fatty fruits

2235
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,760
with seeds far too large to be

2236
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,280
successfully dispersed

2237
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,600
by any wild animal presently alive in

2238
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,880
the americas

2239
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,280
and so that is a paper of jansen and

2240
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,040
martin from the 80s

2241
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,360
which was actually talking about the

2242
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,320
ecology

2243
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,840
of large animal plant interactions

2244
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,840
of animals that we've never directly

2245
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,600
seen but it's like if you

2246
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,000
know that there is a really large seed

2247
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,199
and you know that there's seed

2248
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,719
dispersing mammals

2249
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,440
then it can lead you to hypothesize that

2250
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,600
there was a seed disperser that was

2251
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,640
large enough to eat

2252
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,000
avocados whole um and

2253
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,560
so we can look at anachronism in the

2254
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,159
current moments

2255
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,360
and help us you know retrace the past

2256
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,280
so just like the avocado is an

2257
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,480
anachronistic

2258
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,040
trait with a such large seed given to

2259
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,480
the current ecology

2260
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,360
past ecology we can see cancer as this

2261
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,400
anachronistic

2262
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,280
reversion to a previous mode of

2263
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,719
information integration

2264
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,440
and goal setting that it's like it's

2265
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,320
inappropriate

2266
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
in the context of the goals of the body

2267
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,239
but

2268
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,760
not necessarily within the goals of a

2269
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,280
single cell that just wakes up one day

2270
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,520
it's like wow i'm bathed in glucose

2271
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,920
i should replicate so can't blame that

2272
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,360
stuff

2273
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,280
also like the cancer a lot of the

2274
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,360
markers in cancer cells are

2275
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,760
really like it's like a developmental

2276
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,480
reversion

2277
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,840
so not sure if you guys are aware of

2278
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,520
that or not but it's like they they

2279
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,840
revert to like a more immature cellular

2280
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,800
phenotype

2281
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,280
and so that i mean it's literally like

2282
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,719
going back to the past

2283
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,840
so it's interesting

2284
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,199
[Music]

2285
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,880
like is there something can be learned

2286
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,159
from the degree of reversion

2287
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,839
uh the degree of

2288
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:17,040
i'm not sure here's one thing that comes

2289
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,239
to mind there is there's

2290
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,360
some cancers where the the it

2291
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,480
goes back to like a stem cell of that

2292
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,600
tissue

2293
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,679
so like it's like a white blood cell

2294
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,040
cancer that like

2295
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,679
replicates a lot of white blood cells

2296
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,239
but

2297
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,880
when there is a cancer in a reproductive

2298
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,840
organ

2299
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,920
sometimes it's like called a teratoma

2300
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,199
because it can have

2301
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,640
like hair and nails and stuff like that

2302
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,520
because it's actually pulled back so far

2303
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,320
that it can then

2304
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,400
differentiate on all the pathways

2305
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,520
rather than a reversion up from being

2306
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,000
like a

2307
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
healthy reproducing white blood cell

2308
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,840
precursor to just a

2309
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,440
higher like a white blood cell stem

2310
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
lineage but it doesn't pull back all the

2311
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,760
way to including ectoderm

2312
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,920
whereas if it was in um you know a

2313
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,440
reproductive cell then it could do that

2314
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,880
cool biofilms

2315
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
do you want to take this one danielle

2316
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,320
yep so i think the

2317
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,040
key point here is that bacteria have ion

2318
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,760
channels

2319
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,120
just like metazoans do you know dopamine

2320
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,760
gpcrs the proteins that signal between

2321
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,640
neurons

2322
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,400
those are not innovations of mammals

2323
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,480
they're not innovations of vertebrates

2324
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,239
they're those kinds of channels and

2325
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,000
diffusible molecules

2326
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,120
are cellular they're pan cellular

2327
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,760
and so what's being shown here is just

2328
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,800
like in

2329
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,360
previous figures we saw one kind of

2330
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,800
eukaryotic cell right

2331
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,199
you knew because it had a nucleus we had

2332
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,880
one eukaryote

2333
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,199
connecting with a few other eukaryotes

2334
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,000
well here

2335
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,040
we have one prokaryote connecting with

2336
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,159
other prokaryotes

2337
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,320
to do the exact same thing which is

2338
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,440
increase its

2339
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,440
sensory capacity again not

2340
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,480
instantaneously

2341
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,520
but think time cone like cone

2342
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,719
and so in the same way that the

2343
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,120
eukaryotic cells form a cognitive

2344
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,239
individual

2345
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,600
through their associations and

2346
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,719
affordances such as the gap junctions

2347
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,760
bacteria when they form a biofilm can

2348
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,120
also form a larger cognitive integrated

2349
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,400
individual

2350
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,920
and you can still say well but from an

2351
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,440
evolutionary point of view

2352
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,280
this the unit of selection is the single

2353
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,120
bacteria okay

2354
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,440
that's the evolutionary individuality

2355
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,480
definition

2356
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,840
and when we use the cognitive

2357
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,000
individuality definition we see a lot of

2358
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,360
the similarities between

2359
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,840
a multicellular organisms tissue and

2360
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,159
then a multicellular

2361
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:49,920
biofilm tissue even not in a biofilm i

2362
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,960
mean bacteria have

2363
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,520
an incredible ability to like i mean

2364
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,280
it's like antibiotic resistance right

2365
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,960
like they do plasmid exchange which

2366
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,560
isn't like their chromosomal dna but

2367
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,280
it's like small

2368
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,520
little snips of dna like they just like

2369
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,880
have a handshake like it's like a

2370
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,480
bacterial handshake like now

2371
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,080
i'm gonna give you some antibiotic

2372
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,600
resistance too like we spread

2373
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,440
germs like covet and bacteria to one

2374
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,960
another they spread

2375
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,120
like plasmids to one another which which

2376
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,880
confer different properties you know and

2377
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,600
then

2378
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,520
we select for this like antibiotic

2379
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,360
resistance through the use of all of our

2380
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,000
like antibacterials and so only bacteria

2381
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
that have these little plasmids are

2382
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,760
survive it's really interesting

2383
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,840
so even outside of a biofilm they do

2384
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,600
some some kind of um

2385
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,280
you know communication and like

2386
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,199
cognitive expansion of their self in

2387
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,560
like the way that we do with our inner

2388
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,280
circle of friends

2389
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,080
cool all right key ideas um i just

2390
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,520
highlighted a few of these

2391
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,280
like points but there's a huge box in

2392
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,360
the paper so we'll just read through the

2393
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,320
highlighted parts

2394
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,360
here i'll take this one so first

2395
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,840
a unified integrated cognitive self or

2396
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,000
individual can be defined with respect

2397
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to the integrated ability to pursue

2398
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,719
specific goals via a homeostatic process

2399
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,600
that resists perturbations

2400
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,840
second an agent's cognitive world can be

2401
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
quantified and characterized

2402
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,040
enabling comparison with others

2403
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,560
regardless of their material

2404
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,679
implementation

2405
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,679
by estimating the spatio-temporal

2406
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,840
boundaries of its area of concern

2407
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,159
the volume in space and time over which

2408
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,159
the agent is able to take measurements

2409
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,199
exert influence

2410
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,280
and functionally link disparate events

2411
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,440
learning and association

2412
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,360
three the borders of the temporal and

2413
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,280
spatial events of which a given system

2414
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:29,840
is

2415
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,560
capable of measuring and acting map out

2416
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,840
a cognitive light cone

2417
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,000
a boundary in the informational space of

2418
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,960
a mind

2419
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,120
so estimating the spatio temporal

2420
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,719
boundaries of an agent is something i

2421
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,639
find particularly interesting so i just

2422
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,040
put that in as a question at the bottom

2423
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,000
do you want to read some of the next

2424
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,080
ones daniel

2425
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,480
yep so these are some key ideas four

2426
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,600
five six

2427
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,719
so four cancer is a reversible shrinking

2428
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,639
of the computational boundary of a

2429
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,000
biosystem

2430
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,520
pretty tantalizing there with the

2431
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,040
reversible i'm sure

2432
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,800
that's something that a lot of people

2433
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,560
would like to see maybe

2434
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,320
the idea is you remind the rogue agents

2435
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,520
about bigger goal like hey you know i

2436
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,880
know you're hungry

2437
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,199
but we wait in line at this restaurant

2438
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,239
so that everybody

2439
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,440
gets what takes care of them and maybe

2440
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,199
that helps remove the you know

2441
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,719
cancerous uh restaurateur five

2442
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,520
agents scaled up by evolving from basic

2443
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,719
homeostatic loops

2444
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,639
driven by active inference which is

2445
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,719
surprise minimization

2446
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,320
by the addition of delays which are

2447
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,199
memory anticipation which is inference

2448
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,000
inference has planning as inference and

2449
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,800
networks

2450
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,159
which is spatially distributed

2451
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,400
processing enabling learning

2452
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,920
and progressive abstraction

2453
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,560
generalization and data that's pretty

2454
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,199
cool

2455
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,480
to see active inference and elaborations

2456
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,920
of active immigrants

2457
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,960
at the heart of this future electrical

2458
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,800
evo eco diva it's like saying

2459
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,800
you start with action and perception and

2460
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,000
then you can

2461
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,159
carry that forward in time planning

2462
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,760
anticipation

2463
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,880
have an extended trail of memory that's

2464
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,040
you know the past and then you can also

2465
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,960
expand spatially but again a spatial

2466
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,719
isn't instantaneous

2467
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,120
there's a propagation speed in the media

2468
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,880
and so even laterally

2469
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,639
similar agents interact through this

2470
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,639
light cone way

2471
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,480
so nice to see where active inference

2472
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,239
plays into like cones there

2473
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,199
and then six infotaxis the drive for

2474
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,360
better actionable intelligence

2475
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,120
about the regularities and patterns in

2476
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,199
the world and in the agent's own

2477
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,239
mechanism

2478
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,239
encourages cells to connect in groups

2479
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,600
via signaling

2480
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,760
this is another area where active

2481
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,520
inference has a lot to say

2482
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,120
and is a value add relative to a reward

2483
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,719
only framework like reinforcement

2484
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:51,600
learning

2485
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,040
because again what drives the bacteria

2486
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,360
to coalesce and to work together

2487
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,000
so maybe it's reward but then you have

2488
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,360
to appeal to this idea

2489
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,199
that they're maximizing reward with

2490
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,960
their behavior and the state or leave

2491
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,560
and all this kind of stuff

2492
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,600
info taxes helps us understand that the

2493
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,320
way to get

2494
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,480
good actionable intelligence which is

2495
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,520
kind of like active

2496
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,719
inference a i right there is to make

2497
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:17,920
your actions

2498
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,480
exist on the trade-off frontier like the

2499
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,400
pareto optimal trade-off

2500
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,679
between getting it done right now and

2501
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,920
expanding your epistemic boundaries

2502
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,639
sometimes the right move is to contact

2503
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,000
somebody who knows better

2504
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,159
or to go to a website that might inform

2505
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,560
you better and so it's actually a useful

2506
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,199
action

2507
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,480
in the moments to arrange to get better

2508
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,920
information later

2509
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,440
and so active inference helps us think

2510
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,280
about how these different needs are

2511
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,400
traded off by

2512
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:51,280
organisms cool

2513
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,719
all right so seven collecting into oh i

2514
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,199
can't do it

2515
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,960
syncidium sensitium do i do it

2516
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,560
okay collecting into a

2517
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,800
syncidium enables all of the cells to

2518
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,159
share the same data

2519
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:11,280
and access the same memories

2520
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,440
um that's pretty awesome you must

2521
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,040
assimilate it's like the borg

2522
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,800
yep sorry star wars nerd um okay also

2523
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,120
greed eight greed at the single cell

2524
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,719
level for information

2525
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,159
infotaxis drives cooperativity as each

2526
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:28,560
unit

2527
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,480
expands its measurement boundary

2528
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,159
communication with neighbors

2529
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,880
and thus inevitably becomes part of a

2530
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,000
bigger self with bigger

2531
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,639
set points serving as homeostatic

2532
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:39,760
attractors

2533
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,920
so i think active inference also has a

2534
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,600
role to play here

2535
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,560
in this cooperativity so like i can

2536
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,239
reduce my uncertainty about my

2537
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:49,120
environment

2538
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,679
by cooperating with people who have the

2539
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:52,239
same

2540
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,880
goal that i have right like or

2541
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,600
cooperating

2542
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,679
becoming part of a group you know and

2543
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,120
and therefore our efforts

2544
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,880
make a bigger effort or bigger

2545
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,960
anyway less surprise when i'm in a

2546
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,320
bigger group because it

2547
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,639
expands that that light cone right and

2548
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:09,520
then nine

2549
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,679
there is a fundamental symmetry between

2550
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,679
anatomical control mechanisms

2551
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,960
and cognitive mechanisms and

2552
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,960
um i think that this was discussed in

2553
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,320
terms of bioelectricity

2554
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,040
in the paper do you guys have anything

2555
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,159
to add

2556
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,320
one thought on that is cooperation

2557
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,239
arising at a higher level

2558
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:29,600
so that just reminds me of like if

2559
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,880
you're looking for a microscope and you

2560
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,120
saw a cell a eat cell b

2561
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,679
you'd go i mean adversarial relationship

2562
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:36,960
right could there be anything more

2563
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,239
directly adversarial

2564
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,159
and then you pull back and it's a white

2565
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,600
blood cell

2566
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,560
you know that's attacking a cancer cell

2567
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,320
so it's cooperative at a higher

2568
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,199
level but it can look adversarial at a

2569
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:49,679
low

2570
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:53,280
level and so what does that

2571
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,320
map onto in different systems how can we

2572
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,440
re-imagine conflict and tension as

2573
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,040
actually playing a stabilizing or

2574
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,000
cooperative

2575
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,760
role at a larger scale can interpersonal

2576
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,199
differences in perspective or

2577
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,320
disagreements lead to a cooperative or

2578
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,840
regenerative collective this is what we

2579
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,320
hopefully move towards

2580
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,280
i saw some pigeons procreating yesterday

2581
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,560
while i was out walking around in my

2582
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,159
neighborhood and it definitely looked

2583
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,199
adversarial like it looked very

2584
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,840
very adversarial but they were

2585
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,560
cooperating at a higher level

2586
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,280
looks can be deceiving uh okay

2587
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,880
definitely i was thinking of a case

2588
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,800
where like if a tiger attacks me i

2589
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,440
should just assume that it's like

2590
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,280
an information transfer that needs to

2591
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,800
happen i don't know

2592
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,000
come get peace with it

2593
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,800
sarah oh it's like in um the selfish

2594
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,920
gene by

2595
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,360
dawkins he says uh yeah why would you go

2596
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,239
beyond the gene

2597
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,600
does it make any sense you know would

2598
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,600
you have mammals like uh

2599
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,159
doing kind acts for each other just look

2600
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,920
at the lion eating the gazelle

2601
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,520
and how could that possibly be a

2602
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,040
collaborative relationship and then i

2603
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,760
thought

2604
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,679
what if those two populations stabilize

2605
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,600
each other through deep time

2606
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,320
and they can't coexist and then they

2607
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:12,960
actually

2608
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,239
persist better both because of that

2609
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:20,718
one act so who's to say

2610
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,239
but just one thing like if if that is

2611
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,000
all the case you know if this is all

2612
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,480
like whatever man the universe becoming

2613
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,199
like why would it be that that we had

2614
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,800
such a hard time with it like

2615
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,239
shouldn't it shouldn't there be some

2616
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,239
mechanism that allows me to just be like

2617
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:36,800
oh okay

2618
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,880
cool you know like i don't get that

2619
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,760
i think the mechanism is narrative

2620
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,040
cognitively

2621
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,800
it might play out differently in

2622
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,320
different systems

2623
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,639
but agree to disagree it's a narrative

2624
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:51,440
that we can both

2625
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,280
agree on we're cooperating at that

2626
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,880
narrative level doesn't mean that we

2627
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,280
don't

2628
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,080
disagree in fact we entrench that we

2629
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,040
disagree

2630
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,560
but we're agreeing at a higher level

2631
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,639
cool do you want to read the next ones

2632
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,320
so yeah just a few of the key points

2633
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,320
from 10 11 12.

2634
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,880
uh 10 bioelectric integration helped

2635
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,040
evolve control strategies and cognitive

2636
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,080
content

2637
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,840
across the continuum from chemical

2638
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,800
networks to human minds

2639
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,920
11 the key points here were that there's

2640
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,560
a scale

2641
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,880
in variance with how different systems

2642
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,560
make decisions

2643
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,639
and that we can across different systems

2644
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,080
study how the cybernetic

2645
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,560
processes of learning and parameter

2646
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,440
optimization

2647
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,280
are implemented by a large number of

2648
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,120
units pursuing

2649
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,560
infotaxes and homeostatic goals aka

2650
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,159
pragmatic value and episodic value and

2651
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,440
12. a conceptual unification is proposed

2652
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,400
in this paper

2653
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,159
as scale-free cognition and um

2654
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,760
then it's talked about how these

2655
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,920
boundaries between different subunits

2656
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,480
are a major control mob between the self

2657
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,280
and the world

2658
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,040
like the cell is doing the same stuff

2659
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,800
whether it's part of an organism or a

2660
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,080
part of a cancer

2661
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,159
but it's actually this control knob like

2662
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,400
what are the limits of the cognitive

2663
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,440
individual

2664
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,679
that sets the cell up to act a certain

2665
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,520
way or another

2666
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,800
and uh then a reminder at the very end

2667
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,360
from a utilitarian perspective that the

2668
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,360
most appropriate level of analysis

2669
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,000
is to be determined empirically aha was

2670
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,880
empiricism

2671
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,679
determined empirically and that is said

2672
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:32,159
to be

2673
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,480
the level that facilitates prediction

2674
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,280
and control

2675
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,880
with the least effort by the

2676
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,199
experimenter or by the system itself

2677
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,080
what if they disagree and gives rise to

2678
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,920
a unified understanding that drives the

2679
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,800
most novel

2680
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,440
robust research programs at the bench

2681
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,080
nice

2682
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,920
you know if it doesn't advance your

2683
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,400
career as a scientist

2684
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:58,000
that's not the case

2685
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,840
this is you daniel active inference in

2686
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,320
multi-scale communication

2687
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,000
just wanted to capture a little bit

2688
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,239
about multi-scale systems and active

2689
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,400
so here we have nested systems so the

2690
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,159
top left you know that's an ant brain

2691
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,239
that's a picture that sasha took of an

2692
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,719
ant brain that came from a pogo ant

2693
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,800
and then there's the colony with a bunch

2694
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,760
of nest mates

2695
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,840
dragging food around and then the colony

2696
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,920
is embedded within an ecosystem

2697
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,960
so within one nested system you know

2698
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,679
within these

2699
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,440
time diamonds that are sort of nested

2700
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,800
inside of each other

2701
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
we can think about how the internal

2702
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,239
state of one

2703
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,080
is linked to the external state being

2704
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,280
the next level up

2705
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,360
like the internal state is the brain and

2706
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,199
the external niche to the brain is the

2707
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,520
body okay now the body and the brain are

2708
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,560
the internal state

2709
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,199
for what the colony and then the colony

2710
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,880
is like the internal state

2711
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,280
for the ecological niche so that's

2712
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,800
something that we've seen before

2713
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,960
with how active inference helps us

2714
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,679
understand and model and simulate

2715
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,400
hierarchically nested systems but also

2716
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,040
we can

2717
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,120
think about interactions at the same

2718
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,719
scale like collective behavior

2719
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,120
collective intelligence as occurring

2720
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:05,840
when

2721
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,199
at the same of agent they're interacting

2722
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,600
like laterally and so that's this teal

2723
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,400
arrow

2724
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,800
that's where you have two agents there

2725
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,280
are they're each other's external state

2726
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,080
so active inference helps us zoom up and

2727
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,639
out

2728
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,960
and down and in and then it also helps

2729
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,400
us go laterally

2730
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,639
and then not to repeat it too many times

2731
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:27,600
but the lateral

2732
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,239
transmission isn't instantaneous it's

2733
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,320
dynamic it happens through time

2734
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,480
which means that we don't need to look

2735
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,440
at all

2736
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,759
lateral interactions just the time cone

2737
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:45,280
cool uh predictions and research program

2738
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,520
uh there was a big list here so i just

2739
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,400
pulled a few

2740
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,920
of them out i'll read some of these off

2741
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,320
which are a lot of them questions so is

2742
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,080
there a quantifiable sense

2743
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,000
in which biological systems model

2744
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,600
themselves

2745
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,400
can an in silico evolutionary system be

2746
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,159
built containing both genetic

2747
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,239
and physiological components which

2748
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,400
simulates the scheme described above

2749
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,040
homeostasis and infotaxis and

2750
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,800
illustrates the emergence of different

2751
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,360
scales of cognitive horizons over time

2752
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,360
can we directly observe the evolution of

2753
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,600
multicellular goals from networking of

2754
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,320
agents

2755
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,600
with single cell homeostatic goals

2756
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,520
might there be higher level effects on

2757
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,120
the physiological boundaries

2758
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,280
of the cognitive sub-agents within the

2759
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,080
body from exposure to psychedelics which

2760
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,159
have long been claimed to expand

2761
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,800
transpersonal boundaries or induce ego

2762
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,239
death

2763
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,800
the analogies between geometric spaces

2764
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
and cognitive ones need to be explored

2765
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,600
further as

2766
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,840
has begun beginning to be done via

2767
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,639
geometric

2768
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,480
information theory time diamond anyone

2769
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,400
definitely i think that there's a lot a

2770
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,639
lot of room to go here

2771
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,360
will complex engineered systems set

2772
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,320
novel goals

2773
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,880
and if so how it is a prediction of this

2774
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,600
view

2775
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,760
that adaptive useful robotics will

2776
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,239
require components that are themselves

2777
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,280
competent and

2778
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,480
goal seeking that is super interesting

2779
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,000
also um because really as an intelligent

2780
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,760
you know being capable of cognition so

2781
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,280
are all of my parts

2782
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,119
so if we're going to really import you

2783
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,520
know give rise to

2784
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,760
intelligent life intel intelligent

2785
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,800
artificial life

2786
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,000
we have to start with intelligent

2787
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,520
artificial components i think that's

2788
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,119
super cool

2789
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,840
and also goals we can't we can't just

2790
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,040
say well let's just build

2791
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,080
you know a bigger car or a bigger

2792
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,360
computer i mean what

2793
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,000
do we want this intelligence design

2794
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,520
system to be intelligent

2795
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,119
in the service of or in the way of

2796
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:48,480
and uh it's a disaster waiting to build

2797
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,679
capacity without goal

2798
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,600
for sure do you want to read some more

2799
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,960
of these

2800
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,920
yep so the second set of predictions so

2801
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,280
this is where

2802
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,880
mike is setting out a little bit of his

2803
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,280
uh agenda the next work in this

2804
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,320
subfield i just you know the subfield

2805
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,280
each of the fields

2806
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,800
they're modular they have their own

2807
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,560
disciplinary histories their own

2808
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,119
disciplinary anticipation but this

2809
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,159
subfield

2810
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,400
should focus on the discovery of

2811
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,320
bioelectric communication inducing

2812
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,520
technology

2813
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,360
so just like once we had chemical

2814
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,440
biology people were really excited about

2815
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,960
finding drugs that bound

2816
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,320
to proteins well now that we're aware of

2817
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,000
bioelectricity let's think about

2818
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,679
manipulations and measurements of

2819
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,679
bioelectricity

2820
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,480
two it's a prediction that it's possible

2821
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,880
to induce the formation of metazoan like

2822
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,880
bodies in an otherwise unicellular

2823
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,840
organism

2824
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,920
by forcing the expression of appropriate

2825
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,239
electrogenic proteins and gap junctions

2826
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:47,679
so he's trying to get towards some

2827
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,280
unique predictions and experiments

2828
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,600
uh prediction that transcriptomic which

2829
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,119
means gene expression

2830
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,159
analyses of regeneration events from

2831
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:01,040
bacterial biofilms plants and metazoan

2832
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,119
models of limb regeneration

2833
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,199
should show consistent use of

2834
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,199
electrogenic proteins

2835
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,960
in the events that enable cooperation

2836
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,239
towards self-limiting

2837
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:13,280
morphogenetic cascades so it's kind of

2838
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:13,600
like

2839
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,320
the um the structure informational or

2840
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,000
cognitive structure

2841
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,040
of recovery and repair might have some

2842
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,880
similarities across systems

2843
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,600
that wouldn't immediately be seen as

2844
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,159
similar

2845
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,040
otherwise scale-free cognition

2846
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,920
hypothesis

2847
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,719
suggests that multihuman systems cough

2848
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,880
remote teams could have their own

2849
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,000
degree of cognition so as we always say

2850
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,280
you know things that the brain knows

2851
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,800
that the neuron doesn't things that the

2852
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,800
colony knows that the ants decimate

2853
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,600
doesn't

2854
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,199
there's got to be things that remote

2855
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,360
teams or any other kind of team

2856
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,600
know that individual participants don't

2857
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,639
know

2858
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,520
and then the exobiology question is

2859
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,560
given a novel

2860
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,360
life form or just a novel form how does

2861
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,880
one know when successful

2862
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,400
communication has taken place and

2863
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,920
that's an interesting question for a lot

2864
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,440
of you zeno slash

2865
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,759
exobiologist seti anyone

2866
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,920
cool next slide so this is in the

2867
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,960
section

2868
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,199
what it feels like to be a pancreas but

2869
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,719
i i really pulled um

2870
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,880
the point that kind of hit home for me

2871
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,320
the most out of the section

2872
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,560
and the final point that mike makes in

2873
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,360
the paper

2874
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,440
so i'll just read this off it is

2875
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,880
striking that the process

2876
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,440
which zen practice is meant to reverse

2877
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,520
attachment to past memories and high

2878
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,719
valence for future

2879
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,440
expectations or fears is precisely the

2880
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,000
process

2881
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
suggested to be responsible for the

2882
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,360
creation of complex

2883
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:47,119
selves with a capital s it is unclear

2884
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:48,800
whether it is beneficial or even

2885
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,880
possible to truly live in the moment and

2886
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,719
let go of past memories and future

2887
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,760
expectations

2888
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,760
but anyone who succeeded in doing this

2889
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,440
would achieve precisely what zen

2890
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,480
promises

2891
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:01,119
the dissolution of the self and the

2892
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,800
final sentence of the paper which i just

2893
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,600
loved

2894
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,000
recreating the unification into and

2895
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,719
liberation

2896
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,679
from larger scale unifying unifying

2897
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,520
cells with a capital s

2898
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,520
would be a true pinnacle of synthetic

2899
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,199
biology and artificial

2900
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,400
intelligence engineering wow

2901
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,199
this is good paper

2902
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,760
um so just key questions at the end what

2903
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,360
might a good understanding of this work

2904
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,000
enable

2905
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,600
what are the unique predictions and

2906
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,119
implications of this work

2907
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,520
what are the next steps for fep and

2908
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,480
active inference

2909
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,000
in relation to this work what are the

2910
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,080
goals of this research and what are you

2911
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:36,560
still

2912
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,280
curious about so we will be thinking of

2913
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,639
all of these things

2914
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:44,639
as we get ready to do um 25.1 and 25.2

2915
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,159
over the next couple weeks

2916
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,560
so thank you for participating there is

2917
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,480
a feedback form for feedback

2918
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,480
and you can get in touch with active

2919
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,520
inference lab at

2920
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,800
all of these links on this slide

2921
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,920
nice work blue great job with your first

2922
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,320
broadcasting and facilitating on this

2923
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,360
one that's really

2924
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,400
fun so yeah anyone's welcome to

participate or contribute to our live

2926
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,719
activities

2927
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,560
asynchronously synchronously we'll

2928
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,560
figure out the right performance for you

2929
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,040
so thanks sir also for joining thanks

2930
