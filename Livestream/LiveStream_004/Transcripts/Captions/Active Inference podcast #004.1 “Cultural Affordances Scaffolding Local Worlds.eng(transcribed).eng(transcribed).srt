00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,160
welcome here

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
and also just on a note of video

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,438
etiquette if people are

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,760
muted in a noisy background or raising

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
their hands when there's this many

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
participants in the chat

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,159
it would be excellent and help us with

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
our turn taking and reduction of

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,799
uncertainty

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,479
about who's to speak next so here we are

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,759
in stream 4.1 and the structure of today

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,200
is going to go like this

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
first we're going to have a few check-in

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
questions and

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
warm-up discussion then we'll get to the

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,240
paper itself

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
which is ramstead at all 2016. we'll

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
talk about the big aims of the paper

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
go through a roadmap of the paper to see

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
how the authors get from a to z

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
we'll go through the abstract to

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
understand how the authors represent

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,040
their own work

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,799
then we'll go through the box of

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
definitions as well as the figures

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,439
at that point we'll have time for

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
questions and other insights

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,719
and also we've implicitly prepared for a

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
podcast 4.2 where we'll be able to have

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
further discussions on some key

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
quotations or anything arising that we

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
don't get to

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
this week so thanks for that part here

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
we are in the check-in and everybody can

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,120
feel free to introduce themselves in

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
their location if they would like

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
the first question is pretty broad but

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,120
that's what the warm-up is about so

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,840
what is culture

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
it's a good question

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
or in the sense of this paper in the

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,160
sense of culture that's being scaffolded

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
within a kind of framework that we might

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,959
want to build out

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
what would that kind of culture refer to

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
well so i'm maxwell ramstad i'm uh

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
the first author on this paper cultural

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
affordances

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
um by the way i'm really grateful uh

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,000
for this uh podcast you all have been so

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
great just in general over the last few

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,120
weeks and i'm

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,480
i'm particularly touched that you're

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
giving uh the work that we've developed

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,200
so much attention

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,519
um and it's like just i'm just so full

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
of gratitude

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,159
this is so cool um so culture

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
at least in the sense that we're using

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
uh

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
the term here means something like the

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
taken for granted

89
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
i think is sort of the heuristic way

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
that i like to think about it

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
it's sort of like in a given local frame

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,480
of reference

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
uh in a given environment shared by a

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,080
group of people

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
a living together what are the things

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,720
that are taken for granted what are the

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,400
uh sets of expectations and beliefs and

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
sets of practices and norms um

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
you know that that are shared and that

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,840
essentially

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
uh structure people's intuitive grip on

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
their shared social world

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
any other thoughts on culture there yeah

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
in sociology uh we define culture it's

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
kind of three different dimensions

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
you have the symbolic ideal dimension

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
which is really i think equivalent to or

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,519
equivalent to

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,519
semantic knowledge uh we break it up in

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
terms of norms values and beliefs

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
uh we have a psychobehavioral dimension

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
which is really about in body culture

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
how your body moves

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,640
um the skills that you have in in terms

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
of psychological kind of

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
terminology i would really say your

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
skills and habits um

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
in in kind of that non-declarative

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
memory sense

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
and then the third dimension is really

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
our material dimensions of the physical

122
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
things that we create the tools the

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
buildings the fashion

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
um which i think the degree to which i

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
understand the affordance literature i

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
think all three of those dimensions

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
definitely have versions of affordances

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
that could connect to that

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
um i think that was one thing i did see

130
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
in the paper that

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
it did seem to be very much focused on

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,199
just that semantic

133
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
kind of symbolic dimension and not

134
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
really uh explicitly incorporating the

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
other dimensions that

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
at least in sociology we would kind of

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,080
um

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
include in that definition of culture

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
cool yeah thanks for that that was very

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
rich actually

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
uh very interesting uh points that

142
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
you're raising

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
yeah i should just give some maybe some

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
historical background

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
on this paper this was the first in a

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
series of papers that have been

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,639
developed

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,479
into basically like a a variational or

149
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
free energy approach to culture

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
and i think a lot of the elements that

151
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
you're mentioning

152
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
were only sketched in this paper

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
uh and were developed in i think further

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
iterations of the model

155
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
uh so everything that you're that you

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
just outlined uh

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,479
richard i think are are very essential

158
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,280
and crucial

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
things that need to be tackled when

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,639
studying culture so

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,000
it's great that you're raising them cool

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and i think the question about multiple

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,039
kinds of culture

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,680
ranging from the semantic concepts to

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,160
the

166
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,919
externalized productions or the

167
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
artifacts of culture

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
bring us this idea of scaffolding

169
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,600
culture so what is a way

170
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
that culture is scaffolded someone can

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
raise their hand maybe someone new but

172
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,479
something that

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
guides the construction just like a

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
scaffold

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
i'll give one way which is education

176
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
because pedagogy is sort of the

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
guide rails for how individuals learn

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
about those

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,479
norms as well as how to use the

180
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,520
artifacts

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
and construct new artifacts these are

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
ways in which culture is scaffolded

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
because it provides structure

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
for the growth to happen within

185
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,198
any other comments on that

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
okay and then the last warm-up question

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
is what is shared intentionality

188
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
or what's a way in which somebody has

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
seen shared intentionality play out in

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,319
their

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199
recent experience

192
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
well so there are two parts to that

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,520
right there's shared and there's

194
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
intentionality

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
so intentionality at least in the sense

196
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
that we're using it in the paper draws

197
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,039
on

198
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
the philosophical construct of

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
intentionality that we we can

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
basically uh you know

201
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
you can draw a lineage all the way back

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
to brentano effectively but

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,440
so by intentionality we mean orientation

204
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,960
towards the world

205
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
uh we don't necessarily mean

206
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
intentionality in the sense of

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
uh having the intention to do this or

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
that

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,319
it really it's from the latin i think

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,599
intensio

211
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
which is the word that was used to

212
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
describe what a

213
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,080
uh what an archer is doing with his

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,800
arrow

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
uh to hit the target it is intensio

216
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,520
with the target and so it it it's this

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,639
that we're trying to

218
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,319
get at and one of the things that we're

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,919
trying to argue here is that what

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
part of what makes um a shared social

221
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,599
world

222
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
just that a shared social world is that

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
there are forms of relating to that

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,759
world so forms of intentionality that

225
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,000
are

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
also shared uh among the

227
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,360
the people who live in that world

228
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
together so that's that's what we were

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,759
trying to

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,400
get at ultimately i think and i think

231
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
what's interesting in terms of

232
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,199
if you take that definition and you look

233
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
back at the scaffolding

234
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
um you know if you look within the

235
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,080
individual there's this network of

236
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
semantic and episodic memory

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,199
and non-declarative memory that's

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
organized in the brain if you put me in

239
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,440
contact with another individual from my

240
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
culture who shares my language

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
and we begin to construct this we space

242
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,560
if you look at

243
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
the phenomenology um and then now what

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,680
happens with

245
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
this dyad either we introduce a third

246
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
person or we then one of us leaves the

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,519
relationship and we go

248
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
uh interact with someone else if you

249
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
spread that dyadic interaction out to a

250
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,559
network

251
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
and then you look at the fractal scaling

252
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
of that network there's this way to i

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
think to very deliberately keep track

254
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
and build up

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
from organized memory and brain to an

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
institution of 25

257
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
000 people dynamically interacting by

258
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
following this

259
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
this these mechanisms by which you

260
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
create the shared space and looking at

261
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
those emerging properties

262
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
and trying to model them mathematically

263
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
couldn't agree

264
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
and there's a quote from the paper which

265
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
i'll spare maxwell from reading is

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
uh near the end it says to address more

267
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
complex social situations

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
it is useful to revise current

269
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
sociocognitive models of joint attention

270
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
to encompass fundamentally triadic

271
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
situations

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
in which the third is the socially

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
constituted niche of affordances

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
supported by local ontologies and

275
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
abilities so we're just jumping in

276
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
today but that's sort of where we're

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
wanting to go with this paper and in

278
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,279
discussion

279
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
is towards understanding what is that

280
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
third space and how does the aim or does

281
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
the intent

282
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
play in yeah stephen

283
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
yeah and i think this cultural thing

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,839
also brings in that into subjectivity

285
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
it gives a way to understand how to

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
approach it beyond education

287
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,959
beyond sort of the banking of

288
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,720
programming people saying well what's in

289
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
the environment particularly now that

290
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
we've got situations of

291
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,560
cross-cultural what cultures have to try

292
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,279
and

293
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,200
understand and work together is it all

294
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
about teaching us

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
how to tolerate each other or is it

296
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
about understanding

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
how we perform in the environment so i

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
think it's got a lot of

299
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
well here we are finally at the paper uh

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
cultural affordances scaffolding local

301
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,800
worlds

302
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
through shared intentionality and

303
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
regimes of attention so we'll definitely

304
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
want to unpack each of these

305
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
concepts and it's in frontiers in

306
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,800
psychology from 2016.

307
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,519
the big aim of the paper grasped from

308
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
the abstract in the

309
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
introduction section is to better

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
understand how culture and context

311
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
interact with human biology

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
to shape human behavior cognition and

313
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,720
experience

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
so kind of all of it kind of things that

315
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
richard was bringing up early on

316
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
and from the introduction the

317
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
integrative framework we propose

318
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,240
bridges cognitive and social sciences to

319
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
provide two things

320
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,320
first an expanded concept of affordance

321
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
that extends to socio-cultural forms of

322
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,200
life

323
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
which will unpack in box one and two a

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,040
multi-level

325
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
account of the socio-culturally

326
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,120
scaffolded forms of affordance learning

327
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,959
and the transmission of affordances in

328
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,760
pattern sociocultural practices

329
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
so the key piece there is that

330
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
multi-level account

331
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
because we're not going to have an

332
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
individual level account by which

333
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
collective outcomes arise

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
or a group level account by which

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
individuals are shaped in their behavior

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
uniquely those are sort of two sides of

337
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
the same coin or

338
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
some of the sides of a many-sided coin

339
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,160
that constitute

340
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
this top down and bottom-up relationship

341
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
that we see in a lot of multi-scale

342
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,279
systems like

343
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
the brain being nested within a body

344
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
inside of a niche

345
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
inside of these institutions that last

346
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,839
beyond the lifespan

347
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
of the organism any thoughts on the aim

348
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,399
here or questions about anything

349
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
cool well then let's get to the roadmap

350
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
so the roadmap

351
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,839
i just copied out the section headers

352
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,720
how that takes us on a journey or on a

353
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,519
narrative

354
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
in our learning odyssey in a sense in

355
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
the beginning there's an introduction

356
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
and a theoretical framework for

357
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
affordances is provided

358
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
and that includes i know the font may be

359
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
a little small perspectives importances

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
and phenomenology

361
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
landscapes and fields meanings and

362
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
affordances

363
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
and then we reach figure one which has a

364
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
basic cognitive formula

365
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
for automatic intentionality and figure

366
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
two that expands on that

367
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
formula slash comment format so that's a

368
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
theoretical framework for affordances

369
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,519
maybe could anyone chime in what what is

370
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,720
an affordance

371
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
in this uh context or in the cultural

372
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
context or in the context of whichever

373
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,160
field you're familiar with

374
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
yeah so i guess just for a simple

375
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
definition it's something that invites

376
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
action or interaction

377
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
and the the cartoon example is always a

378
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
chair a ford sitting

379
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
um but in the context of a social

380
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
interaction it could be some

381
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
environment that affords or that elicits

382
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,399
our

383
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,880
interaction maybe conversation or music

384
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,160
making with another person

385
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
great and it makes sense to start the

386
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
paper off with this framework for

387
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,320
affordances because action

388
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
opportunities are so fundamental to

389
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,920
active inference

390
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
and to action-oriented frameworks this

391
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,440
is really what defines

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
action-oriented frameworks is they focus

393
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
on actions

394
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
and the stimuli or the cues that lead to

395
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,399
action

396
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
so affordance is their opportunity the

397
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,920
second

398
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
section here is the neurodynamics of

399
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
affordances so this is the integration

400
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,600
of the cognitive and the neurosciences

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,240
with

402
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
the more behavioral ecological concept

403
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
of an affordance

404
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
computation representation and minimal

405
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
neural models

406
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
is addressed and also many of these

407
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
ideas later papers

408
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,120
include other or different depictions

409
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,279
and this is already four years past so

410
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
that equates to about 400 papers in

411
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
between us and here

412
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
yeah i should say um like this is

413
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
probably the weakest section of the

414
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,279
paper

415
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,480
as it currently is formulated

416
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
um i mean yeah as you're pointing out it

417
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
was published in 2016 and we started

418
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,079
really working on this in 2015

419
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,480
and i mean since i did a whole phd

420
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
focused on the free energy principle

421
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
and uh what it what it entails and how

422
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:51,920
it works

423
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
and so on and i think uh

424
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
i i mean i wouldn't disavow what we say

425
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,160
here

426
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,440
uh but i think that definitely

427
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
our our understanding of the

428
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
representational implications

429
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
of the theory have been refined over the

430
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,519
years

431
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,920
but i mean this this is basically in a

432
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
nutshell what we tried to pursue

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
since 2016 so as you're saying like

434
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
several papers have been published since

435
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
um and the uh you know

436
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
the the the framework has moved a little

437
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,800
bit

438
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,759
absolutely richard yeah i think i mean

439
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
definitely whenever we look back on our

440
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
earlier papers we're always like i

441
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,160
should have said all these different

442
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,880
things

443
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
but i i actually really appreciate this

444
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
paper because you know for reading

445
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
it just as a complete non-expert in a

446
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
lot of these fields

447
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
um the free energy principle is very

448
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
very difficult to find an entry point

449
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
into

450
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
and sort of have something that i think

451
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,959
is very conceptual

452
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
and grounded in neuroscience i think a

453
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,240
lot of social sciences could wrap their

454
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,720
head around

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,800
you know relatively easily and then to

456
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
trace this as breadcrumbs to the more

457
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
advanced

458
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
um free energy principle stuff um i i

459
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,759
really appreciate i thought it was a

460
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
great entry point into this literature

461
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
and kind of gave me a

462
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
you know a foundation to kind of start

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
to wrap my head around how these

464
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
these concepts are being applied in that

465
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,920
more mathematical context

466
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
you're saying that it's one of the

467
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,040
reasons why we

468
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
chose this paper other than shannon

469
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
suggesting it is

470
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,440
for me at least when i can see the path

471
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,320
in the literature

472
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
well okay here's what they thought in

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
2016 which means in years leading up to

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
2016

475
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
and then yes it can be refined or

476
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
represented or enriched in later

477
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,759
work but seeing the breadcrumbs or the

478
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,720
pheromone trail

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
is how i get a calibration of the

480
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
derivatives of how the ideas are

481
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,360
changing

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,079
through time and i found that um yeah

483
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,040
one way maybe

484
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,120
weaker but the most growth has happened

485
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
here and this is one of the areas where

486
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
the most growth can happen

487
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
so this is why we continue to dip back

488
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
into the literature

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
even longer than four years in the past

490
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
i know it feels like forever though

491
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,839
because sometimes there's a uniqueness

492
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
to that cultural artifact that

493
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
isn't just about how well it conveys

494
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
what the relationship is between

495
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
neuroscience and free energy

496
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
but rather how well it conveys the what

497
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,520
the researchers were working on

498
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
in that intersection so we're thinking

499
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
through other minds for some of us it

500
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,559
was us in the past for some of us

501
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,679
it was just another paper yeah and i

502
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,520
will say this just really quick too

503
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
a lot of the affordances that concept of

504
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
affordance in sociology is very much

505
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,760
grounded in kind of a pragmatic

506
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,320
process philosophy you know whitehead

507
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
the idea that you know reality reaches

508
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,919
out to the other reality

509
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
and so if you if if that is where our

510
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,679
literature is grounded

511
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,039
to be able to have something like this

512
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
that's very conceptual to work through

513
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
those philosophical ramifications

514
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
and then begin to ask how would this fit

515
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
with uh the free energy principle

516
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,760
and i think vice versa as well having

517
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
the free energy principle community

518
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,120
kind of understanding some of these

519
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
philosophical concepts and ideas

520
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
to kind of ground more conceptually not

521
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,400
so much mathematically what it is that

522
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,799
their

523
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,080
perspective is offering to other

524
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,639
disciplines

525
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
well said then we move to

526
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
figure three now i found that figure

527
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,840
three four

528
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
and five make a really nice sequence and

529
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,280
we'll go through them in

530
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
sequence because it enriches one level

531
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
of detail

532
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
on top of one level of detail of a

533
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,640
hierarchical prediction error

534
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
minimization framework

535
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
figure four diagrams it a little bit

536
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
more clearly from a bayesian perspective

537
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,360
and then five brings on another level of

538
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
realism

539
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,559
then we talk a little bit in this

540
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
section about predictive processing and

541
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,200
attention

542
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
and that returns our attention to the

543
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
idea of culture

544
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,760
as regimes of attention from the title

545
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
at this point if i had to rewrite this

546
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,679
paper this would be two papers and

547
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
this would be the split so i really

548
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,720
think that

549
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,360
the first part of the paper really uh

550
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
tells a story about affordances uh

551
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
affordances the affordances that are

552
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
avail available in the

553
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
human landscape uh you know in terms of

554
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
their depend the dependence of certain

555
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
kinds of affordance on convention

556
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
whereas others are more just dependent

557
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
on the kind of spontaneous

558
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,760
you know action biology of human bodies

559
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
and then the second half of the paper

560
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
turns to this concept of attention

561
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
and with with all this in place says

562
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
okay so how is culture

563
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
acquired in these what we're calling

564
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,039
regimes of attention which are

565
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,120
effectively shared patterns

566
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,200
of allocating your attention to this

567
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,360
rather than that as being salient

568
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,679
so and this all is bit you can read this

569
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
as kind of computational goffman

570
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,679
uh for richard who's done comes from

571
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,880
sociology

572
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
uh yet it's an attempt to kind of spell

573
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,559
out

574
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,320
how what would a mechanistic model

575
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
of you know regimes of like civic

576
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
inattention

577
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
and so on look like effectively uh when

578
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,919
you're trying to bridge these different

579
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,039
levels

580
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,880
but you know i think there's a lot in

581
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
this paper and this is a good kind of

582
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,320
split point if you want to see what the

583
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
paper is doing effectively

584
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,640
nice very helpful for us because it just

585
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,120
reads

586
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
as a turing tape to those who are

587
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
reading it line by line but to know that

588
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
there's a conceptual demarcation

589
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
is helpful and regimes of attention i

590
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
just think is a great term to capture it

591
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,280
because it's kind of like well where's

592
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,360
the regime it's everywhere and it's

593
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,320
nowhere it just

594
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
is the water that culture is existing

595
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
within

596
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
in this section we have figure 6 of a

597
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,919
diagram of the looping effects or the

598
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
rolling loops

599
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
that mediate cultural affordance

600
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
learning

601
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,159
there's a discussion of skilled

602
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,240
intentionality and affordance

603
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,480
competition with some nice citations to

604
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,200
other work

605
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
about the skilled intentionality

606
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
framework

607
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,039
there's a section on shared expectations

608
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,039
local ontologies and cultural

609
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,000
affordances

610
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
and we think a lot about ontologies here

611
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
and about the words that we use to

612
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,679
locally organize

613
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,520
our thought and cultures this kind of

614
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
multi-scale

615
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,240
ontology that helps organize stimuli

616
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
in a sense and the section closes with

617
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,679
a discussion of shared expectation and

618
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,200
implicit learning

619
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,320
then the last section major section of

620
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
the paper is the regimes of shared

621
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,559
attention and shared intentionality

622
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,200
reflecting gating abilities and

623
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
affordances

624
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
and moving the loop regimes of shared

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
attention and skilled intentionality

626
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,000
before a conclusion so that

627
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
is the roadmap that's how you get from

628
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
discussion of the ecological

629
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
psychological or

630
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
behavioral inactive concept of an

631
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
affordance

632
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,760
then into the neuroscience of

633
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,360
affordances and then

634
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
as suggested by maxwell there's a bit of

635
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,480
a intermission

636
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
conceptually here before turning to a

637
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
second half of the paper

638
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,799
that has to do with the actual ways in

639
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,480
which culture is scaffolded through

640
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
these regimes

641
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,240
of expectations and attention any

642
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,280
questions on the roadmap

643
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
cool all right here we are in the

644
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,520
abstract

645
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,159
which i often find helpful to read

646
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,640
because

647
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
i know that authors put a lot of care

648
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,320
into the abstract because

649
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
it represents to the in group to the

650
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
field as well as to the out group to the

651
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
reviewers to the editor to the reader

652
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
it reflects what the paper is going to

653
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
be about and people get

654
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
surprised and even disappointed when the

655
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,000
abstract is

656
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
off base relative to what the paper

657
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,080
actually delivers on

658
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
they write in this paper we outline a

659
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,280
framework

660
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
for the study of mechanisms involved in

661
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
the engagement of human agents with

662
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
cultural affordances which we're going

663
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,760
to define soon

664
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,440
our aim is to better understand how

665
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
culture and context interact with human

666
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
biology to shape human behavior

667
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,760
cognition and experience we attempt to

668
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
integrate several related approaches in

669
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
the study of the embodied

670
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
cognitive and affective substrates of

671
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,039
sociality and culture

672
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
and the socio-cultural scaffolding of

673
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,799
experience

674
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
that's the first half the abstract then

675
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,240
they write

676
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
the integrative framework we propose is

677
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,360
we propose

678
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
bridges cognitive and social sciences to

679
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,400
provide

680
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,480
one an expanded concept of affordance

681
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
that extends to sociocultural forms of

682
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,960
life

683
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
and two a multi-level account of the

684
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
socioculturally scaffolded forms of

685
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
affordance learning and the transmission

686
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
of affordances in a patterned

687
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
socio-cultural practices and regimes of

688
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
shared attention

689
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
the framework provides an account of how

690
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,039
cultural content and normative practices

691
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,520
are built on a foundation of contentless

692
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
basic mental processes

693
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
definitely something we'll return to the

694
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
acquire content

695
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
through immersive participation of the

696
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
agent in social practices that regulate

697
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
joint attention and shared

698
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
intentionality

699
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
okay any thoughts on the abstract or

700
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,840
questions before we turn to the box

701
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,679
cool well box one i thought it would be

702
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,640
helpful just to

703
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
list out the terms of the different

704
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,880
types of affordances then go

705
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,520
through them what is an example of each

706
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
of these

707
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
kinds of affordances or what are the

708
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,279
differences between these types of

709
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,080
affordances

710
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
so maybe we could start there if someone

711
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
could raise their hand and

712
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
pick one of these types of affordances

713
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
natural cultural or conventional

714
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,480
and then define uh what it means to them

715
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
or an example of it

716
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,799
yep maxwell um well

717
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,760
essentially what we're suggesting is

718
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,480
that

719
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
well cultural affordances by the way um

720
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,159
i i just noticed that my um

721
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,080
my camera is frozen is that the case for

722
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
everyone as well

723
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
your screen looks dark you can either

724
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
toggle the camera on and off or just

725
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
reload the page

726
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
um after talking i might try to rejoin

727
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,919
just so the camera

728
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,919
freezes um yeah so what we're

729
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,600
essentially arguing is that

730
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
in humans all affordances are at least

731
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,600
minimally cultural in the sense that i

732
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
mean i don't know about you but

733
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,520
as i was growing up uh my mother told me

734
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,640
not to slouch

735
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,240
uh while i was at at the dinner table

736
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,799
uh and so you know it's something as

737
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,000
simple and natural

738
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,679
as sitting um does actually come with a

739
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,039
cultural scaffold

740
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,320
and what we're saying is that there's

741
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,279
basically a spectrum of affordances

742
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
you can think about the space of

743
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
affordances with his with which humans

744
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,840
interact

745
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,640
as going on a kind of continuum from

746
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
natural to conventional

747
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
where natural affordances depend mainly

748
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
just on the biophysics of the human body

749
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
in its interaction with the environment

750
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
whereas conventional affordances depend

751
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,559
on

752
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
these implicit or explicit sets

753
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,640
of uh conventions or shared beliefs

754
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,000
uh so you know an example of the latter

755
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,559
would be

756
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,440
um a king's throne right you don't sit

757
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,039
on the king's throne unless

758
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,159
you're a very specific agent uh so

759
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
a king's throne doesn't afford sitting

760
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,840
uh for everyone in the same way that say

761
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,640
just a chair

762
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
or a stool might afford sitting there

763
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,880
there are conventions shared conventions

764
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,240
uh the kind of uh structure

765
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,120
which affordances are available uh and

766
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,240
which are not

767
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
for a given agent

768
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,279
cool richard yeah i was just curious

769
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,360
in the neuroscience about like actually

770
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,640
distinguishing that so if i

771
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,120
if i see a cup my mirror neuron system

772
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
fires and i begin to kind of enact

773
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,600
the act of reaching out and grabbing it

774
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
but then semantically i know that you

775
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,320
know

776
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,679
as a a lowly surf i'm not allowed to

777
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,480
touch that

778
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,559
is there actually any research showing

779
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,080
the conflict between

780
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
semantic knowledge about you know and

781
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
self-related knowledge that i'm not

782
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
allowed to do that

783
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
with the automatic kind of reaching out

784
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,120
mirror neuron system simulation of

785
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
touching the cup that's really

786
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
interesting i'm not sure

787
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,240
i i don't know if there's any data about

788
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
this particularly

789
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,000
it would be very interesting though one

790
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
thought i had was

791
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
some experiments i believe by michael

792
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,000
von elk with hands grasping cups at

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,320
incorrect ways so it's something when

794
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,520
you're here and you're on c oh that's

795
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,799
not how you're supposed to grab a cup

796
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,600
well why not

797
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
well because i can't rotate my wrist

798
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
again to drink it so it's the wrong way

799
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
to hold it because it's not really a cup

800
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,320
of water

801
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
if i can't drink from it in that

802
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,159
functional affordance based

803
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
sense but i agree it would be

804
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
interesting and we'll follow up on that

805
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
and stephen did you have any class

806
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
yeah i actually had a workshop when i i

807
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
was working with a group with um

808
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
who with disability who um and i

809
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
mentioned about affordances as part of

810
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,399
it

811
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,320
and partly having done this paper and

812
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,679
one of the participants she was saying

813
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,279
how when she sees a cup because she

814
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,480
can't pick it up

815
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
and she doesn't see it as a cup unless

816
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
it's one that's got a handle that she

817
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,919
can reach her hand into

818
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,880
and do that so that kind of sense of

819
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
things presenting is quite true and i

820
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,679
like this breakdown because

821
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,399
the i get a sense that the following on

822
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
from the later work that maxwell did

823
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
like natural affordances is like you

824
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
know if there's a cliff it doesn't

825
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
afford me to walk any further

826
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
whereas cultural is a bit more of like

827
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
this mixing sort of egotic

828
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,240
kind of space where it's conventional

829
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
it's like the the throne it's like

830
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
it's not up for negotiation it's like

831
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,399
you don't sit on the chair it's like a

832
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
fixed rule there's no

833
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
kind of inter-subjective piece going on

834
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
so in some ways the cultural piece seems

835
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,000
to have

836
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,559
some sort of negotiation associated with

837
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,679
it which is quite

838
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
quite cool would it be accurate to say

839
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
that that in a sense of

840
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,039
if if i i had the simulation to reach

841
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,399
out and grab the cup

842
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,080
but then my semantic memory says no

843
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,440
we're not allowed to do that could that

844
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
almost be like a prediction error in the

845
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
sense of like i'm predicting that i'm

846
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,360
going to do this well no

847
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
we don't do that precisely and the way

848
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
that you would do that

849
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
is probably by having a hierarchical

850
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,200
model where basically you know so the

851
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
the notion of hierarchy i mean it has

852
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
political implications and we can kind

853
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,760
of ditch those

854
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,480
uh so i prefer thinking about it in

855
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,399
terms of center and periphery

856
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,799
right where like the the periphery is

857
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,640
the the end of it that's closer to the

858
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,799
sensory motor like interactions and the

859
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,440
center

860
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
is something more like you know what we

861
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,640
would think of as the top of

862
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
uh of a processing hierarchy where

863
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
representations are

864
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,360
progressively more compressed uh so

865
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
if you look at the hierarchy from from

866
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
periphery to center or from bottom to

867
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,080
top

868
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,960
what you have represented there uh if

869
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,320
you'll allow me the

870
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,919
language of representation for a second

871
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,840
we can finesse it later but what's

872
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
essentially represented there

873
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
is as you progress towards the center

874
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,720
slower

875
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
and slower or more and more abstract

876
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
regularities

877
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,120
so you might think that yeah as you see

878
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,279
the chair at a kind of more

879
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,720
automatic uh kind of a sensory motor

880
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,200
level

881
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
you you see it as something that you

882
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,799
could sit on but as that

883
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,120
ascends the processing hierarchy at some

884
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
point it registers an error as in like

885
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,039
semantically i'm not allowed

886
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
to sit on this because it's a king's

887
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
chair so

888
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
precisely that's how that would work as

889
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
and you can you can accommodate for this

890
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
kind of conflict by allowing the system

891
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
to have a layered or hierarchical

892
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
structure

893
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,480
and great point and this relates to how

894
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,520
it's a spectrum

895
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,200
of affordances so for example a violin

896
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,360
when i look at a violin i have the

897
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,520
biophysics to bend my fingers

898
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,640
but i can't play violin so i see an

899
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,159
affordance for something i could pick up

900
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,640
potentially and not everybody may see

901
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,679
that affordance

902
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,360
however somebody else sees that and

903
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,799
culturally they think oh i could play

904
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,600
this

905
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
uh song or i could play that song and so

906
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,840
what song they see

907
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
the device as being able to be used for

908
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,399
is going to be part of their

909
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,640
enculturation part of their education

910
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
which builds upon the biophysics of the

911
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,000
human body

912
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,519
and that's why we have different dance

913
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
styles in different places

914
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,440
from different cultures even though

915
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
everybody's elbows

916
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,799
still move the same way sasha

917
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,120
yeah so in trying to understand

918
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,159
affordances

919
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,519
um i tend to think of it as like

920
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,240
the space of what is allowed but in

921
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,080
walking through the different kinds of

922
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,120
um affordances that we have um it

923
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
becomes pretty clear that

924
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,919
it's not just what is allowed it's very

925
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,720
strongly gated by the top-down priors of

926
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,320
what you think should be allowed

927
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,799
in your space and it just kind of

928
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,600
reminds me of this

929
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
um anecdotal understanding of how

930
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,519
children

931
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,200
interact with an environment versus

932
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
adults and

933
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,559
how children would use or sit on objects

934
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,399
that adults would never think of sitting

935
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,360
on

936
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
and kind of the the different ways that

937
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,640
they

938
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
see and use the world um because they

939
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,159
don't have these

940
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,600
top-down priors of um what one

941
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,120
should and should not do and so

942
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,440
that that's a nice way of um kind of

943
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,039
circling back to the point of this paper

944
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,600
that

945
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,320
um everything is embedded in culture and

946
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,519
you don't just start from

947
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
kind of the biophysics of sitting and

948
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
work your way up

949
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,159
you're always going back and forth with

950
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,600
this is uh this is

951
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
such a great point thank you for thank

952
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,840
you for uh pointing that out sasha like

953
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,039
the the agenda here is to

954
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,320
uh pursue this kind of

955
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,960
excuse me this kind of cooperative turn

956
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
in the anthropology literature which is

957
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,320
to say that

958
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,600
um you know as joseph henrich

959
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
who's one of my uh one of my favorite

960
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,960
like anthropologists

961
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,440
uh psychologists uh out there as he

962
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
points

963
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
as he puts it we've crossed the

964
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
evolutionary rubicon

965
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,480
in a way our our survival as

966
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
humans depends on our ability to

967
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,600
reliably

968
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,960
access and use uh stored

969
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,919
cultural information effectively and

970
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,640
that's had an

971
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,960
influence on the way that our biology

972
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
has evolved so you know compared to

973
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,399
chimps for example we have uh

974
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,519
really weak digestive juices and that's

975
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,159
because we've

976
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,080
we've been able to offload the metabolic

977
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
cost of you know having this extremely

978
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,159
elaborate digestive system uh

979
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,240
to our technology effectively you know

980
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,480
so tool use the use of fire cooking

981
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,519
technology

982
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,600
has allowed us to process food in a way

983
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,080
that then co-evolves with our bodies

984
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
and takes the kind of processing load of

985
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,519
the food uh

986
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,919
off the body itself towards these

987
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,919
cultural artifacts and practices

988
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,320
that have co-evolved with our biology

989
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
and that's really the the point is that

990
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,720
uh all human affordances are cultural

991
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,919
affordances

992
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
which exist on a spectrum from more

993
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,000
natural to more conventional but

994
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,960
human biology is a cultural biology and

995
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,919
biologic

996
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,440
and yeah culture is a biological

997
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,320
phenomenon

998
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,640
i think that the two are kind of

999
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,360
irreconcilably joined

1000
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,720
in the case of humans and i'll build on

1001
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
that to

1002
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
describe the difference between the

1003
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,199
field and the landscape of affordance

1004
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,560
sorry i meant insurmountably you're uh

1005
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,599
irreducibly joy not not here uh

1006
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,560
yeah sorry oh yeah it works so the field

1007
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,679
of affordances

1008
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,520
are the affordances in the landscape

1009
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,040
with which the organism

1010
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,879
can dynamically cope and intelligently

1011
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,199
adapt so that's at an organismal

1012
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,960
level the field of affordances is like

1013
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,480
the field of play it's the field of

1014
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,119
action

1015
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,440
for that agent the landscape of

1016
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,199
affordances on the other hand like the

1017
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,480
landscape exists

1018
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,719
beyond me even when i can't interact

1019
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,760
with it directly

1020
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
and similarly the landscape of

1021
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,040
affordances

1022
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
is defined here as the total ensemble of

1023
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,839
available affordances for a population

1024
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
in a given environment and so the

1025
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,359
concept of chair

1026
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,679
just as sasha was bringing up the

1027
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,480
landscape

1028
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
of affordances of chairs includes things

1029
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,839
for little people

1030
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,839
for tall people for people with small

1031
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,119
hands for larger hands

1032
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
the landscape of affordances is at the

1033
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,800
population level

1034
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
which means it includes all these

1035
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
differences that are biophysical and

1036
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,720
developmental and cultural as well

1037
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,200
so the field is what one individual

1038
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
agent is able to interact with

1039
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
and that's sort of where the rubber hits

1040
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,280
the road of action-oriented frameworks

1041
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
and then when we pull back a level to

1042
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
this evolutionary perspective on

1043
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
action-oriented frameworks

1044
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
we get to this landscape of affordance's

1045
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
idea

1046
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,359
any thoughts on that

1047
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,440
yes stephen yeah i think that that

1048
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
way that things are embedded it comes

1049
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,520
back to that piece with the throne as

1050
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,720
well is

1051
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,000
where where that chair is for it to be

1052
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,480
ascribed as a throne that you don't sit

1053
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,200
on

1054
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,440
is partly processed by what's going on

1055
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
around

1056
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
in that setting at that moment like if

1057
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
there's no one around and it's an empty

1058
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,680
room

1059
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,200
you may sit on the chair if you don't

1060
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
think anyone's going to see you

1061
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,359
but when the cultural kind of rules of

1062
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,880
the game are in play

1063
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,839
or if you see you know if it was a room

1064
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
where there's only children in there

1065
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
compared to a room where there was an

1066
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,079
adult watching

1067
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,119
so there's this kind of negotiation

1068
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,240
going on

1069
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,000
um which is quite quite complex

1070
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
and i think previously without free

1071
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,240
energy i don't think there was a way to

1072
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,079
be able to take that many different

1073
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,440
parameters

1074
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,640
and sort of integrate them

1075
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
richard yeah i think what's really

1076
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,560
fascinating too when we talk about this

1077
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,280
is that

1078
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
um the role of language in the role of

1079
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
imitation and the role of just watching

1080
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,079
other people where

1081
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,680
i can walk into a room and know

1082
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
absolutely nothing about the norms

1083
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,960
values and beliefs that that

1084
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,520
constrain it but if somebody just tells

1085
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
me you know four or five words they can

1086
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,280
immediately bring me up to speed

1087
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
and kind of and to use the terminology

1088
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
that sasha was using earlier

1089
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
those top-down priors i can gain a

1090
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,400
lifetime of experience

1091
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,440
in 2500 words and watching four or five

1092
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,240
people

1093
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,400
seeing who's rewarded who's punished and

1094
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
i think that i i

1095
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
i'm curious to see and we don't have to

1096
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,680
talk about this now but just you know

1097
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,160
rhetorically i'm curious to see how can

1098
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520
you take in that notion of symbolic

1099
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,480
communication

1100
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,640
and quickly affect somebody's you know

1101
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
prior understanding of situation

1102
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,960
how do you fit that into a network of

1103
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
free energy or agents running off this

1104
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
free energy principle

1105
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
and how does that is it like a

1106
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
synchronization of oscillators on a

1107
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
network like how exactly do you model

1108
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,720
model that process yeah i'm just

1109
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,520
imagining

1110
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,640
you're walking with somebody to a

1111
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
meeting and right before they open the

1112
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,960
door

1113
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
to reduce your uncertainty about what's

1114
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,079
behind the door

1115
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,160
they say hey it's going to be tense in

1116
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
there or

1117
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,359
hey just so you know it's a non-smoking

1118
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,960
room and just like you're saying with

1119
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,240
four or five words

1120
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,440
the way that that person unpacks those

1121
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
words

1122
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,320
symbolically and the way that that

1123
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,839
communication channel

1124
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,480
is utilized to attune the agents on a

1125
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,200
narrative

1126
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,320
level that's what dictates how well

1127
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
the scene is going to go when the room

1128
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,000
is actually

1129
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,640
being inactive and so there's so much

1130
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,119
that we

1131
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,440
tell each other when we're leading into

1132
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,160
events that

1133
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
that does set the tune and that has to

1134
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,440
be unpacked within each person's

1135
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,320
own perspective and also one bonus word

1136
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,359
that's not here

1137
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,640
but umvelt does anyone have a

1138
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,240
sense of what that means but i figured i

1139
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,760
just throw it out there as they sort of

1140
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,240
complement to affordance

1141
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
well if i can just uh comment on uh

1142
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
richard's point uh before getting into

1143
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
unveiled i think the way that you can

1144
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
understand it from a free energy

1145
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,599
perspective is uh i mean andy clark i

1146
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,119
think and andrus robstorff has

1147
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,800
have called this top top effects so

1148
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,760
basically uh passing information from

1149
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,400
the top

1150
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
or the center of one's hierarchy to the

1151
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,000
top of another

1152
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,880
directly through these kinds of uh of

1153
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,040
linguistic tokens that we're exchanging

1154
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
i think that's uh that's a powerful

1155
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,800
intuition

1156
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
what we've done in more recent work is

1157
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,119
extend that to a kind of horizontal

1158
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,520
top kind of communication where it's

1159
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
literally destruct the shared

1160
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
physical structure of the niche whether

1161
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
it's in the in terms of

1162
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
shared artifacts like stories that we uh

1163
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
create and and share with one another

1164
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,680
that

1165
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,880
so these uh effectively these

1166
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
uh parts of models that are offloaded

1167
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,880
onto the physical structure of the

1168
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,280
environment can also come and have these

1169
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
uh kind of

1170
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
uh top-down structuring effects where

1171
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
we're we're effectively installing

1172
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,079
shared environmental priors at into the

1173
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,920
top levels of our hierarchy through

1174
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,720
enculturation

1175
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
nice and how about maxwell what's your

1176
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,599
take on him belt

1177
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,800
i mean i think you know so i think those

1178
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,599
of us

1179
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,320
uh you know working in uh more

1180
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,640
specifically on ecological psychology

1181
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,400
we'll have some beef with the way that i

1182
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
kind of uh just

1183
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
generally put all of this together but i

1184
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,960
think like you know

1185
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,839
affordances umvelts uh phenomenology

1186
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,040
i'm sure many people are not going to

1187
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
agree with me so you know

1188
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,960
feel free to discuss this but that

1189
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,200
they're they're all perspectives on the

1190
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,640
same kind of thing which is that if

1191
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
we're trying to

1192
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,599
talk about you know the meaning making

1193
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,000
of organisms living organisms that share

1194
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,720
a world

1195
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,000
we can't uh we can't just not talk about

1196
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
the first person perspective and the way

1197
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
that meaning appears

1198
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,319
from a specific vantage point and that's

1199
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,240
sort of what the affordances

1200
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,680
and umvelt stuff gets at uh

1201
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
and effectively what we tried to do in

1202
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,880
in this paper

1203
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,160
and that's why i think it's it's the

1204
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,839
kind of contribution to the broader

1205
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,839
project of neurophenomenology is we we

1206
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,200
start from

1207
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,160
the kind of first-person perspective so

1208
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,560
we

1209
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,319
we're kind of trying to cash out you

1210
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,000
know some some subtle

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
social effects like enculturation in

1212
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
terms of learning affordances

1213
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,839
and then we ask the question what's

1214
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
going on under the hood and as it were

1215
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,720
around

1216
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,480
the hood uh for that kind of affordance

1217
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,200
story

1218
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,480
to be cashed out in mechanistic terms

1219
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,599
uh so umvelt is a term uh by

1220
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,359
a biologist i think it's pronounced von

1221
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,280
ushakul

1222
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,319
yeah and he uh i mean it's it's

1223
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,040
essentially

1224
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,000
it's very close to the uh the uh

1225
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,200
affordances story

1226
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
although it's it's more directly

1227
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,400
centered on um

1228
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,240
the perspective of the organism i mean

1229
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
so gibsonians i should

1230
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,240
say like uh you know the ecological

1231
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
psychology was introduced by uh you know

1232
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,040
jj gibson the famous psychologist and

1233
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,680
a lot of ecological psychologists have

1234
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,319
uh

1235
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,560
take issue with our use of affordances

1236
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,440
here

1237
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
uh i think for interesting reasons the

1238
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,880
so the

1239
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,680
for for ecological psychologists the

1240
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
idea is that perception is

1241
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,920
the direct perception of a possibility

1242
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,640
for

1243
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,839
for well it's it's the directly we're

1244
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
directly picking up information about

1245
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,880
our environment like so

1246
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,079
they're trying to emphasize that we

1247
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,680
don't have to go through this elaborate

1248
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,560
kind of

1249
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
inference process there's a sense in

1250
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,920
which like we just

1251
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
directly read off the regularities in

1252
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,480
our sensory array uh

1253
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
what what what is possible and what is

1254
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,680
doable and it so

1255
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,400
in gibson's original formulation this is

1256
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,359
what

1257
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,920
affordances meant what we're doing is

1258
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
more drawing on

1259
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
tony camaro's reinterpretation of this

1260
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,839
concept as affordances 2.0 he calls it

1261
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,640
where an affordance is a relation

1262
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,480
between some relevant features

1263
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
of the environment and skills ultimately

1264
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
you know expectations and skills had by

1265
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,079
an organism so

1266
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,640
this is already a a more inactive

1267
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,520
embodied

1268
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,079
reading of affordances and i mean we've

1269
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:52,640
gotten

1270
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
into some very interesting disagreements

1271
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,960
with people from ecological psychology

1272
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,160
precisely about this

1273
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,560
difference in interpretation so i say

1274
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,960
this because umvelt is very much focused

1275
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,599
on

1276
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,319
this kind of affordances 2.0 perspective

1277
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,240
where what we're trying to do is really

1278
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,119
capture what the world is like for the

1279
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,000
organism that

1280
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
inhabits it from its perspective

1281
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,119
this is also where i think it connects

1282
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,880
with phenomenology which is also this

1283
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,720
kind of more systematic attempt

1284
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,319
to describe things from the first person

1285
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,319
perspective

1286
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,440
great and that okay

1287
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,359
alex first and then shannon

1288
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,520
yeah thanks um as usual i'm trying to

1289
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,079
connect uh to my domain is the

1290
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,680
engineering domain

1291
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,440
and it's more like a question about

1292
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,560
could we consider importances from some

1293
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,440
kind of

1294
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,520
functionalities view as for example

1295
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,280
if i need to drive in a nail

1296
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,079
the hammer the provide provides me

1297
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,480
affordance

1298
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,800
to use it but if i don't have a hammer

1299
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,599
i could use even microscope to do the

1300
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
same

1301
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,000
only one or two times but anyway for my

1302
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,400
engineering task it could be enough

1303
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
and if i see a chair and

1304
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,319
it's provide the affordance to sit it's

1305
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,720
like a basic function of the chair

1306
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,000
to to to sit on it

1307
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,640
so from this perspective how it could be

1308
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,520
considered

1309
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,280
like when agent need to do something and

1310
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
need some kind of functionality

1311
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
and this functionality or maybe service

1312
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,640
to do it how it's possible link

1313
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,880
oh absolutely this has been pursued by a

1314
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,480
lot of work there's a really cool

1315
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,400
group based in um in the netherlands

1316
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,920
uh eric rietveld and julia keverstein in

1317
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,800
particular

1318
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,359
uh work from this perspective where eric

1319
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,200
uh eric ridwell's work

1320
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,960
is in architecture and affordances

1321
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,640
so he he really tries to bring this

1322
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,480
whole affordance's perspective

1323
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,440
uh into the design of the spaces that we

1324
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,400
live in

1325
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,480
uh so what you're saying is totally uh

1326
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,680
consonant with

1327
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,640
uh at least some really interesting uses

1328
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,119
of the

1329
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,040
concept of affordances in the literature

1330
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,000
since the early 2000s

1331
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,880
cool shannon

1332
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,960
i think yeah so i'm just thinking of

1333
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,440
this

1334
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,640
this field landscape difference and

1335
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,359
umvelt

1336
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,960
and it's really helpful considering

1337
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,520
the perspective of the agent you're

1338
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,119
investigating

1339
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,359
especially um so i'm in music

1340
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,480
neuroscience

1341
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
so we can learn a lot about how people

1342
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,960
or brains interact with music by putting

1343
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,599
a person in an fmri scanner and

1344
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,760
playing some music but that's not

1345
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
exactly how we interact with music

1346
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,160
in our day-to-day life maybe now more so

1347
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,079
because we can turn on our ipod

1348
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,040
and just sorry iphone we don't have

1349
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,400
ipods anymore

1350
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,839
um and listen to music alone as this

1351
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,880
um solo endeavor but in general for

1352
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,680
the history of human evolution music has

1353
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,040
been this really interactive

1354
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
participatory

1355
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,319
activity and in order to understand

1356
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,359
um from where i am how we interact with

1357
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,040
understand or process music

1358
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,359
it really is also a question of how we

1359
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,440
understand and interact with

1360
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,560
um other people and it's so when we

1361
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,920
bring in these

1362
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
um affordances we can have an affordance

1363
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,920
for music um in a certain field that's

1364
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,400
you know

1365
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,079
us listening to music alone but as soon

1366
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,640
as the landscape

1367
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,520
is is a little bit bigger and maybe our

1368
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,400
our small field

1369
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,079
incorporates one other person or one

1370
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,520
more other person

1371
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
um then the perspective that we need to

1372
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,359
take

1373
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,839
needs to change to adapt the perspective

1374
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,920
of each of those individuals or

1375
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,160
of that musical sort of environment as a

1376
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,920
whole

1377
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,680
that's such a great point i don't know

1378
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,359
if you're familiar with this paper that

1379
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,680
i just linked

1380
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,240
in the chat it's by anna anderson and

1381
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
tom zimkia

1382
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
uh called exploring the multi-layered

1383
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,119
affordances of confor

1384
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,760
of composing and performing interactive

1385
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,240
music

1386
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,880
with responsive technologies and it was

1387
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,000
one of the first papers to

1388
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,319
pick up our cultural affordances work

1389
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,599
and in precisely the

1390
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,839
context that you're proposing shannon

1391
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,119
like um

1392
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,119
what they're saying is uh our concepts

1393
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,240
need to be enriched

1394
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,400
with a kind of intermediate scale

1395
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,680
concept

1396
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,200
so their idea is like when you're when

1397
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,680
you're performing live electronic music

1398
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,680
there's something intermediary between

1399
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
the field of affordances that each

1400
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,559
individual

1401
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,280
is coping with at any moment and this

1402
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,680
evolutionary level kind of landscape of

1403
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,040
affordances or this

1404
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,040
population level uh landscape of

1405
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,240
affordances where

1406
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,480
there's you know the there are special

1407
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,079
affordances that open up

1408
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,160
in this uh performance uh context

1409
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,280
kind of a a meso scale in between the

1410
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,960
landscape and the field

1411
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,440
uh i forget the precise term that they

1412
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,800
that they introduced but

1413
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,760
uh yeah the music is definitely one of

1414
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,640
the cooler

1415
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,119
domains of application of this uh this

1416
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,400
stuff

1417
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,440
nice sorry

1418
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,880
all right shannon and then

1419
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,240
just saying this is really great thank

1420
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,160
you

1421
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,440
cool sasha um yeah just a brief comment

1422
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,640
to follow up on what alex said um uh

1423
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,319
from the engineering perspective

1424
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,680
you know if you have a hammer

1425
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,520
everything's a nail it

1426
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,359
kind of made me think uh about crime

1427
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,480
where um if you need something and

1428
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,119
you're not

1429
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,760
um inhibited by uh law or social norms

1430
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,280
you can just take it and

1431
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,079
maybe that's a uh you know overly

1432
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,000
simplistic understanding of

1433
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
why people commit crime but in in that

1434
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,000
context

1435
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,280
if you're not inhibited by uh

1436
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,839
laws then your affordances are quite

1437
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,319
different

1438
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,119
than if you are

1439
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,040
okay and perfect richard you're uh

1440
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,440
yeah in terms of the the field versus

1441
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,040
the landscape

1442
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,640
would it be accurate to kind of

1443
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,559
conceptualize this the field of force is

1444
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:26,960
kind of

1445
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,359
the episodic knowledge of the individual

1446
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,000
so what are their

1447
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,640
their personal learned experiences their

1448
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,640
personal body capabilities

1449
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,559
kind of this really episodic self you

1450
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,920
know um

1451
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,079
form of memory where landscape of

1452
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,760
performance is more about the semantic

1453
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,720
knowledge the

1454
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,160
if there was a way for me to kind of

1455
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,760
look at the population and ask

1456
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,359
what are all the skills and habits that

1457
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,960
this population has

1458
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,400
that would be the landscape if i was to

1459
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,000
drill down on one person

1460
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,160
how well do you know how to ride a bike

1461
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,280
that would be more of your fuel

1462
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,000
performance

1463
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,640
precisely that's precisely the idea and

1464
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,359
the idea

1465
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,440
also is that not all affordances are

1466
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,520
equally salient at a given time but

1467
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
they're still there in a sense right

1468
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,599
uh so i don't know like um

1469
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,559
24 7 uh coffee shop there's times a day

1470
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,480
where it's a salient affordance to some

1471
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:14,960
people

1472
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,079
well i was gonna precisely give a a food

1473
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,240
and coffee related example

1474
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,880
uh yeah i i drink coffee in the morning

1475
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,280
but

1476
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,319
i tend to uh have insomnia if i

1477
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,800
if i drink it too late in the evening so

1478
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
there are times in the day when

1479
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,240
coffee affords drinking more than

1480
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,720
other times in the day and so you know

1481
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,559
it it's still the case that at any

1482
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,400
moment i could go into the kitchen

1483
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,599
and make myself a coffee right so

1484
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,680
the field of affordances has more to do

1485
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,520
with those those affordances that are

1486
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,920
soliciting me at a given moment

1487
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,640
uh you know it corresponds to the more

1488
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
the phenomenology of interacting with

1489
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,599
affordances

1490
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,119
whereas the landscape is more an

1491
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,880
anthropological or sociological

1492
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,000
statement as as

1493
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,760
richard you were just saying about the

1494
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,119
kinds of things that a population can do

1495
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,480
in a given space it that you talk about

1496
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
that idea of sailings in the moment

1497
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,440
because one thing we talk about a lot in

1498
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,400
sociology is

1499
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,880
is identity and so if you activate my

1500
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,559
identity prime me to think of as a

1501
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,520
professor

1502
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,880
i'm going to notice certain things in

1503
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,400
environment differently than if you

1504
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,160
prime me to think of my identity as a

1505
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,359
husband or a son

1506
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,079
or a brother um so that kind of then

1507
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,720
again but

1508
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
identity means you know my identity as a

1509
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,400
professor may be different from any one

1510
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,160
of your identities as a professor based

1511
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,280
on socialization

1512
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,599
and culture and disciplines even as well

1513
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,800
right so

1514
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
okay interesting thank you yep and just

1515
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,079
one point

1516
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,640
to tie it back they write as high digger

1517
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,280
famously

1518
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,760
argued it is only when my smooth coping

1519
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,640
breaks down

1520
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,559
say when i run out of coffee or when the

1521
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,720
cut breaks that the objective properties

1522
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,160
the cup becomes salient

1523
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,480
present in perceptual experience at all

1524
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,400
and depending on if you're at home

1525
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,240
you run out of coffee maybe you go back

1526
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,760
to the coffee machine you set up a new

1527
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,160
brew

1528
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
if you're in a restaurant culturally

1529
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,000
maybe you raise your hand or maybe

1530
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,440
you whistle or maybe there's some other

1531
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,359
thing that's done culturally to signal

1532
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,520
that somebody else should see that as

1533
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,800
their affordance

1534
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,640
to come over and ask you what you need

1535
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,720
so the landscape of affordances is a

1536
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,319
very role specific

1537
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,559
uh it's realized through specific roles

1538
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,319
but it represents that population

1539
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,960
level and that's so yeah lots to say

1540
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,000
here that was an

1541
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,240
excellent discussion let's turn to these

1542
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,359
first two figures

1543
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,160
that are cartoons about basic cognitive

1544
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,839
formulas and a little bit more of a full

1545
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:32,720
formula

1546
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,200
so in this first three panel cartoon

1547
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,640
i'll read out the captions and then

1548
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,880
maybe somebody can give an example or a

1549
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,599
thought

1550
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,800
the first caption is the person thinking

1551
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,920
i think they think i think the second

1552
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,640
panel

1553
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,119
says what would others expect me to do

1554
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:49,839
here

1555
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,720
and the third panel says i inferred that

1556
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,839
they intend

1557
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,960
that i should think feel or do x

1558
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,480
so what is a thought or an

1559
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
interpretation or a punch line to this

1560
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
cartoon what would mommy want me to do

1561
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,480
in this context and i you know

1562
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,359
it's i think this is sociality is kind

1563
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,319
of scaling that

1564
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,359
up to an anonymous kind of third

1565
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,040
or other or that is you know

1566
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,760
yeah this kind of anonymous sociality is

1567
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,640
kind of

1568
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,680
scaling that like kind of you know

1569
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,720
parental expectation thing

1570
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,760
up a bit yeah it's like peer pressure

1571
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
made me do it well yeah they

1572
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,119
move your joints for you well no but

1573
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,720
people expected me to do it

1574
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,480
well just because they expected you to

1575
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,839
do it even if that's true

1576
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,240
why did you do it and it comes back to

1577
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,880
this that

1578
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,160
is an account of what peer pressure is

1579
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,000
from from this perspective even if the

1580
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,760
actual biophysics of the joints are not

1581
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,040
being pushed by other people

1582
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,960
and the the point that we're making here

1583
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,960
i mean it's really developed in our bbs

1584
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,960
paper uh thinking through other minds

1585
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,760
but that

1586
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,760
it's that human thinking really is not

1587
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,920
just thinking about other humans

1588
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,760
but thinking through their own

1589
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,440
perspective

1590
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,599
uh and that much of our social

1591
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,559
interactions

1592
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,760
actually are structured by

1593
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,200
the beliefs that we have about

1594
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,359
other people's beliefs about our own

1595
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,359
behavior and beliefs

1596
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,960
so you get this kind of nicely recursive

1597
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,240
intentionality structure uh

1598
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,880
yeah so that that's like the simple kind

1599
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,520
of

1600
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,200
you know the basic cognitive formula

1601
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,880
that we're calling it but the

1602
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,800
i we think that this really applies to

1603
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,440
almost all human thinking

1604
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,240
we're really always kind of trying to

1605
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,319
understand the situation

1606
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,119
uh from the perspective of you know

1607
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,200
shared beliefs about what's appropriate

1608
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,839
in that situation which which implies

1609
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,480
the ability to kind of perspective take

1610
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,440
and to think through the minds of others

1611
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:55,920
yep

1612
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
when someone's talking to hear

1613
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,760
themselves talk as we say

1614
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
it's off the rails because it's not in

1615
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,680
feedback with other minds

1616
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,160
but when somebody is attuned to the

1617
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,880
narrative

1618
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
and the culture of the local world the

1619
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,079
local

1620
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,480
actual interaction not just the

1621
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,680
hypothetical

1622
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,000
then there's the opportunity for

1623
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,520
communication to be targeted

1624
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,000
and direct and actually move towards

1625
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,640
shared

1626
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,400
goals and under shared values as well

1627
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
instead of just individuals

1628
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,079
biophysically running their mouth

1629
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,240
which is an affordance that we also have

1630
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,520
so how do we move

1631
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,079
our communication patterns towards this

1632
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,359
higher level

1633
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,839
um instead of just using the

1634
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,119
opportunities that we

1635
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,400
know that we can also have any other

1636
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,000
thoughts on figure one figure two is

1637
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,480
related

1638
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,040
is that we talk a lot about

1639
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,640
perspectivism and

1640
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,319
you know we go up to higher and higher

1641
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,839
levels but i think

1642
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,760
you see a point at which you can only

1643
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,000
take a perspective on what you

1644
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,240
think to a certain level it gets too

1645
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,559
complex too multi-sensory too many

1646
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:07,760
inputs

1647
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,799
and it is that kind of phenomenological

1648
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,400
embodied feel for what you need to do

1649
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,920
which is not something you even have a

1650
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,640
perspective on that idea of the flow

1651
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,160
so there's this info inferential kind of

1652
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
approach as well as a perspective

1653
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,480
approach which just comes from

1654
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,720
just feeling what you should do and i

1655
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,480
think this this kind of shows that

1656
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,280
because i think

1657
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,079
you can only go up so far and take

1658
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,920
perspectives on things

1659
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,319
when how you act in the moment sometimes

1660
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,920
you just have to be there

1661
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,400
and feel it yeah and we can't perfectly

1662
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,960
emulate

1663
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,040
what somebody else wants and it's just

1664
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,160
not that simple

1665
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,160
we're in the bodies that we have with

1666
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,160
the affordances that we see

1667
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,400
and so to try to over engineer what the

1668
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,280
other person

1669
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
wants or should want or should want to

1670
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,319
want it's

1671
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,359
uh it's a good thought experiment

1672
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,040
and it helps in a lot of situations but

1673
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,760
it is not the end game of relating

1674
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,079
well it might also explain some of the

1675
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,400
difficulties that we're having currently

1676
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,680
in our political landscape uh so i mean

1677
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,000
as a as a canadian i'm very sold on the

1678
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,160
idea of multiculturalism

1679
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,599
and diversity and pluralism but

1680
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,960
i think these are not intuitive modes of

1681
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,599
sociality precisely because

1682
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,799
uh they oblige us to multiply the

1683
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,640
different perspectives

1684
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,520
through which we're trying to you know

1685
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,559
relate to

1686
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,119
a shared social world um and you know

1687
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,040
like uh

1688
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,119
things like dunbar's number i'm sure

1689
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,400
you're all familiar with

1690
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,119
dunbar's number right if you if you uh

1691
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,359
basically plot the size of primate

1692
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,280
brains against the size of their social

1693
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
groups there's almost a linear relation

1694
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,920
and if you extrapolate that to humans we

1695
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,319
would

1696
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,559
you know live in groups of about 100

1697
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,200
150ish

1698
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,559
and you know the the that's

1699
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,799
that probably has a lot to do with you

1700
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,720
know the the kind of sweet spot where

1701
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,040
it's easy to kind of share

1702
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,319
uh you know a bunch of uh beliefs and

1703
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,559
norms and patterns of behavior with the

1704
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,559
group and things get more and more

1705
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,240
complicated as the group expands and

1706
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,040
diversity

1707
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,880
is included which is not to say that

1708
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,960
diversity is a bad thing by all means i

1709
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,680
think uh

1710
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,040
you know we should move in that

1711
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,359
direction uh

1712
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,680
but i think it speaks to some

1713
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,559
difficulties

1714
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,240
that we're seeing politically that it's

1715
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,319
not an intuitive mode of sociality

1716
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,119
cool we'll return to that when we can

1717
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,640
and here in figure 2 we're almost

1718
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,960
rephrasing figure 1 a little bit more

1719
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,440
from an improvisational perspective

1720
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,720
so the left panel the person is thinking

1721
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,280
how much can i improvise here the middle

1722
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,160
panel

1723
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,040
is what do i know they know about me

1724
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,319
right now

1725
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,559
and how much room to improvise does that

1726
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,680
give me

1727
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,319
the third panel reads how much can i

1728
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,440
improvise here

1729
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,680
given what the local cues tell me about

1730
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,359
what others expect

1731
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,000
so a lot to say and think there's

1732
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,440
probably other ways that these

1733
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,680
recursive questions could be formulated

1734
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
but is there anything that

1735
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,920
we haven't addressed in one that people

1736
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,040
might want to address here

1737
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,400
cool this just reminded me of fellow

1738
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,839
jitzer yes

1739
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,079
yeah um i was i was thinking that um

1740
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,119
maybe in the adolescent period

1741
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,640
um we are kind of rebel

1742
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,839
we are rebels against society and trying

1743
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,040
to find

1744
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,319
our identity um

1745
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,079
maybe in other words um minimizing our

1746
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,680
self prediction errors so we are

1747
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,720
like trying to test

1748
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,760
these norms um by being

1749
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,359
uh level so actually by impairing

1750
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,079
uh what others intend that i should

1751
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:16,480
think

1752
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,400
and feel maybe if i do the contrary

1753
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,720
i'm going to learn something about me

1754
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,240
so how can we

1755
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,280
deal with this um like landscape

1756
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,760
affordances and cultural affordances

1757
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,960
or even what our mom is saying

1758
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,799
and what we are really um

1759
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:45,520
trying to find out um about ourselves

1760
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,559
nice maxwell uh

1761
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,240
oh well uh yeah uh uh so

1762
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,000
i thought that was very insightful uh

1763
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,680
thank you very much uh for that

1764
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,480
very uh very interesting um well i would

1765
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,839
have just added that

1766
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,880
so the point here is to kind of say well

1767
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,240
the it's it's not it's not merely just

1768
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,200
about

1769
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,240
you know inferring uh what others think

1770
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,119
i should do

1771
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,480
it's it's really more about the

1772
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,400
situational coping

1773
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,920
right so it's about like learning

1774
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,880
different contexts and learning about

1775
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,920
what's allowable

1776
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,440
in all of these different contexts and

1777
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,359
then being able to juggle that

1778
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,440
and to reactivate the right

1779
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,720
constellation

1780
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,799
of you know semantic knowledge for

1781
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:31,839
example or

1782
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,000
rules and norms that pertain to each

1783
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,280
context

1784
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,839
and and also then you know moving from

1785
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,760
one context to the next

1786
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,839
and seeing what kind of flexibility that

1787
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,839
allows for ultimately

1788
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,839
uh because you know human reality is

1789
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:48,079
improvisational

1790
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,119
like it it's it's it's about kind of you

1791
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,799
know uh

1792
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:56,400
coping with uh with a situation

1793
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,960
given the constraints of that situation

1794
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,640
in real time

1795
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,160
um yeah yeah it's a controlled novelty

1796
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,400
question like a lot of improvisation

1797
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,079
it's a on the edge

1798
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:09,520
the leading edge of the trade-off

1799
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,440
between explore and exploit where

1800
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,240
successful

1801
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,640
systems are at and so the teenage

1802
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,760
rebellion

1803
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,280
if the teenagers just mindlessly

1804
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,760
fell into the line of whatever was

1805
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,200
happening before

1806
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,520
maybe in some niche that was unchanging

1807
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,799
that would be a successful

1808
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,119
evolutionary strategy but the niches are

1809
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,559
always changing

1810
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,559
not for the least of which is ecology

1811
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,000
but also

1812
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
improvisation has this always moving

1813
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,680
dynamic and so the teenage

1814
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,039
rebelliousness

1815
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,280
is there's the element of the individual

1816
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,200
coming to precision about who am i

1817
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,760
and who am i in this broader sense and

1818
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,760
then at the higher level there's this

1819
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,119
explore exploit

1820
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,240
where some element of contrarianism it

1821
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,200
comes across like a

1822
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,440
negative word but if you've ever had

1823
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,720
contrarian models

1824
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,400
then you couldn't know if you were just

1825
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,400
in a very very local optima

1826
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
or whether there are other realms to

1827
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,599
explore

1828
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,079
so there's there's so much there and the

1829
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:06,960
details are all

1830
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,520
in actually formulating these specific

1831
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,119
situations and understanding

1832
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,039
what are the affordances what is

1833
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,680
precision uh

1834
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,039
doing here so maybe in the next bit we

1835
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,520
can

1836
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,000
pretty briefly look through figures

1837
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,440
three four and five

1838
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,839
so maxwell it will be helpful to have

1839
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,520
your perspective on these

1840
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,920
but let's start with three so figure

1841
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,799
three is

1842
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,799
a hierarchical prediction error

1843
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,880
minimization framework

1844
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,359
and maxwell maybe could you give a shot

1845
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,839
on what was being summarized here

1846
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,960
sure um i mean we're just describing

1847
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,480
uh bayesian predictive coding here

1848
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,160
so most uh predictive coding schemes are

1849
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,160
hierarchical as we were just discussing

1850
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,599
uh above where um basically

1851
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,160
what i mean this is more explained in i

1852
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,000
think figure four or five

1853
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,920
but essentially what this figure in

1854
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,680
particular is supposed to illustrate

1855
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,160
is uh the kind of bi-directional message

1856
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,160
passing that's implicit

1857
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,119
uh in in all of this so as we were

1858
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,240
discussing you know the

1859
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,680
top or the center uh is where the

1860
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,319
more kind of abstract or slow

1861
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,599
regularities

1862
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,240
uh are represented and they they

1863
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,480
effectively the the top layers

1864
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,799
provide context for the bottom layers in

1865
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,720
the same way that slow regularities

1866
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,400
provide the context

1867
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,680
or the embedding against which uh

1868
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,160
you know faster regularities unfold well

1869
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,960
these slower regularities or priors

1870
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,760
provide context for the the ones below

1871
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,760
so what you have descending

1872
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,680
or you know coming from the center to

1873
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,799
the periphery

1874
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,200
is effectively predictions about the

1875
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,240
kind of

1876
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,200
data that each subsequent lower layer

1877
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,880
should be receiving

1878
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,000
and the way these schemes work uh is uh

1879
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,359
i i think consonant with the

1880
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,799
phenomenology

1881
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,920
uh you know that so essentially if the

1882
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,680
brain doesn't have to process

1883
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,319
something then it doesn't uh the brain

1884
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,839
is a lazy organ so the

1885
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,839
the thing i i often say to drive this

1886
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,520
home is what was the color of the last

1887
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,280
door handle you opened

1888
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,039
there's a large there's a high

1889
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,119
probability that you didn't register

1890
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,240
that at all

1891
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,400
uh well because there's no reason to

1892
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,720
right like you just smoothly coped

1893
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,480
with with the door what you needed to do

1894
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,160
is open the door to get to the other

1895
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,119
side of it

1896
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,359
and you know there was no reason to even

1897
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,839
register the color of the door handle

1898
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,240
so what with this kind of framework says

1899
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,760
is the signal

1900
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,240
that the brain is processing at any time

1901
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,319
is the discrepancy between the data that

1902
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,319
it was expecting to register

1903
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,079
and the data that it actually does and

1904
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,839
this difference is called a prediction

1905
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:48,880
error

1906
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,960
and uh if you can go just back to figure

1907
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,319
3 for one second

1908
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,400
um i just want to make the point that

1909
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,440
well

1910
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,400
so uh this relates to base in the sense

1911
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:58,720
that

1912
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,440
descending messages carry prior

1913
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,799
probabilities

1914
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,400
so essentially you can think of this as

1915
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,880
the base rate for a given

1916
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,119
phenomenon independent of the data that

1917
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,240
i'm collecting

1918
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,160
and then the prediction error kind of

1919
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,680
combines that knowledge

1920
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,760
with data so it's something like the

1921
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,799
likelihood

1922
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,680
if if the prior is just the probability

1923
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,160
of

1924
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,920
an event that i'm considering the

1925
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
likelihood is the probability of that

1926
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,960
event given

1927
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,920
some data that i've actually uh

1928
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,839
registered effectively

1929
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,839
so this is why these frameworks are

1930
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,200
often called bayesian

1931
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,119
the ascending messages carry prediction

1932
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,640
errors which are likelihoods and the

1933
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,400
descending messages carry prior

1934
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,359
probabilities which

1935
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,960
which are the predictions that the

1936
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,880
predictive brain and so on

1937
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,319
are all about perfect

1938
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,839
and then from here uh we move on to um

1939
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,200
a specific hypothesis the predictive

1940
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,160
coding

1941
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,559
i'm not sure 100 the degree to which

1942
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,319
we're still committed to this functional

1943
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,280
distinction

1944
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,720
but the idea is that um in at least in

1945
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,599
the brain

1946
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,039
they're going to be two kinds of neural

1947
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,880
populations uh

1948
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,760
the ones which encode effectively yeah

1949
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
these generative model units

1950
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,079
which are the ones that are encoding the

1951
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,440
the kind of base rates

1952
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,720
about the phenomena that you're

1953
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,640
interested in and then another

1954
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,520
uh functionally distinct sub-population

1955
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,119
of neurons that's responsible for

1956
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,720
computing the difference between the

1957
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,319
data you expected given these

1958
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,440
predictions

1959
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,200
and the data that you're actually

1960
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,559
receiving

1961
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,799
and again the unexplained signal that

1962
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,640
the part of the signal that wasn't

1963
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,079
predicted by uh the descending uh

1964
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,200
messages is passed upstream uh in the

1965
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,119
hopes that it'll be explained away at

1966
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,720
some point

1967
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,520
and also one note that can help

1968
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,720
understand this

1969
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,520
is this caption in the empirical base

1970
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,160
framework

1971
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,240
the system can then use the posterior

1972
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,480
obtained from one iteration as the prior

1973
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,000
in the next iteration

1974
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,559
and so the empirical base framework is

1975
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,440
in a way what

1976
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,000
it cuts the gordian knot it prevents us

1977
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,760
from just saying well it's just simply

1978
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,280
priors all the way up

1979
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,319
and we start somewhere by starting our

1980
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:10,880
prior

1981
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,559
for one level with just empirically

1982
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,158
what we're getting from the posterior at

1983
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,920
the lower level at that time point

1984
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,319
as a starting point and so this can be

1985
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,000
instantiated in physical

1986
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,120
not infinite systems because

1987
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,640
there's a possibility that empirical

1988
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,560
phase just as it's used in

1989
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,120
data analysis in a variety of fields you

1990
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,520
can use the data to inform a prior

1991
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,279
and then have a generative model that

1992
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,640
starts working from there

1993
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,439
yeah precisely and what bayes does in

1994
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,520
this context is just provide a way to

1995
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,120
optimally combine

1996
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,920
what you knew before sampling any data

1997
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,238
uh

1998
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,040
with what you've learned from that data

1999
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,399
uh so as you're saying

2000
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,479
uh what you're essentially doing is

2001
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,080
multiplying your

2002
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,080
posterior so you calculate your

2003
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,839
posterior by multiplying your prior

2004
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,839
by your likelihood and then uh

2005
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:00,960
normalizing

2006
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,520
uh which can get a bit hairy at times

2007
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,238
but

2008
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,600
that's effectively what you're doing

2009
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,000
here and let's just look at this

2010
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,839
example so here we have the same

2011
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,120
architecture as

2012
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,640
figure four so we're building it out

2013
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,799
figure three this is a

2014
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,880
uh it's a graph it's just nodes and

2015
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,080
edges it's the pure

2016
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,158
representation now we're thinking about

2017
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,000
a little bit more of a plausible

2018
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,399
neural architecture and maybe in some

2019
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,080
brain regions it is this way and maybe

2020
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,679
in other brain regions it isn't this way

2021
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,920
but this is a plausible architecture

2022
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,158
and now we have an example so what is

2023
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,960
being shown with the dog

2024
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,839
well this is just to re-illustrate the

2025
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,399
center versus periphery distinction

2026
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,279
uh well so the the image of the dog has

2027
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:43,600
just

2028
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,799
undergone a fourier decomposition

2029
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,880
which basically means that you're kind

2030
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,799
of separating out the different spatial

2031
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,158
frequencies

2032
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,960
uh that are used to generate the image

2033
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,679
and

2034
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,360
i mean the hypothesis is always sort of

2035
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,800
the same is that the closer you are to

2036
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,320
the sensory periphery

2037
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,239
the the more you're dealing with faster

2038
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,920
changing regularities

2039
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,280
uh so high spatial frequency information

2040
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,040
is represented at the bottom or the

2041
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,800
periphery of the hierarchy

2042
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,120
and as you ascend the hierarchy what you

2043
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,440
see is essentially lower and lower

2044
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,520
uh spatial uh frequency information

2045
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,679
uh so this is the kind of idea here is

2046
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:22,640
that like the

2047
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,560
the the fast regularities are

2048
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,000
represented closer to the sensory

2049
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,159
periphery slow ones closer to uh the

2050
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,280
center

2051
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,719
uh yeah

2052
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,239
i hope i said that right and um and and

2053
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,360
yeah uh

2054
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,320
most sensory modalities are gonna be uh

2055
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,159
deconstructed in this way i mean you

2056
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:43,440
know for the visual

2057
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,120
uh brain regions uh you start off

2058
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,880
you know detecting uh essentially lines

2059
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,120
and you know like grading patterns and

2060
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,640
the more primary

2061
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,440
us visual areas like v1 and everything

2062
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,000
and then as

2063
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,600
you ascend the cortical hierarchy what

2064
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,120
the neurons become

2065
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,480
sensitive to are groupings of these

2066
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,080
patterns so things that change at a

2067
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,920
slightly slower

2068
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,080
time scale i mean if you did one of

2069
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,000
these fourier decompositions to an image

2070
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,159
of the face what you'll see is that the

2071
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,159
gross morphological features of the face

2072
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,239
like you know where your cheekbones are

2073
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,600
and where your uh you know jawline is

2074
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,679
are much coarser than the fast changing

2075
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,440
things in your face like your eyes and

2076
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,120
your mouth uh

2077
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,880
and so again you you might assume that

2078
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,239
this is represented

2079
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,679
hierarchically uh in the brain um

2080
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,640
and let me see i'll add one more level

2081
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,000
to the specific visual

2082
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,920
example because it's in the specifics

2083
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,199
that we can see

2084
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,280
what we're getting out of this framework

2085
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,880
so low spatial frequency

2086
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,000
is like a blur filter it's a very uh

2087
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,960
it's averaged out

2088
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,239
over large regions of visual space on

2089
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,320
in contrast the very high spatial

2090
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,159
frequency it looks grainy

2091
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,360
and that's kind of like turning the

2092
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,280
contrast very high up to over

2093
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,719
emphasize differences between

2094
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,320
neighboring pixels but

2095
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,080
when you do that you lose the global

2096
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,679
structure so we know that from playing

2097
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,880
around in photoshop

2098
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,800
well it would be really cool if we could

2099
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,560
just see the world in total

2100
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,360
high resolution and just optimize this

2101
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,400
with one level

2102
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,719
but it turns out that in the retina the

2103
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:19,679
cells are

2104
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,760
activated even before the lines

2105
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,120
detection it's like

2106
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,679
light first dark it can only detect

2107
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,040
whether it's on or off

2108
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,679
extremely locally and so how does that

2109
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,000
signal which is ultimately an extremely

2110
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,199
local contrast

2111
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:36,400
signal how does that percolate up in the

2112
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,480
context of deep priors about

2113
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,159
regularities in nature

2114
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,000
to look at deep mind look at the images

2115
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,760
that are produced in deep dream

2116
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,320
these regularities that appear natural

2117
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,840
they're not just any kind of natural

2118
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,239
they're

2119
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,600
human visual niche natural like grass

2120
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,960
and clouds

2121
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,040
these kinds of things have structures

2122
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,199
that certain other kinds of repeating

2123
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,600
uh like a grid just doesn't appear in

2124
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,480
nature

2125
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,800
and so this is a structure by which the

2126
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,640
hyper local contracts

2127
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,960
to contrasts literally between pixels in

2128
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,920
this image

2129
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,239
can be passed up and you can end up

2130
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,840
getting this full spectrum

2131
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,040
for your uh resolution on the image

2132
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
and then to add one more level of detail

2133
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,560
what we experience

2134
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,120
isn't any single one of these levels

2135
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,040
because we experience a world in full

2136
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,679
color

2137
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,920
though there's no uh color receptors at

2138
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,719
our periphery

2139
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,239
and also a world that's at full

2140
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,719
resolution though we have very very

2141
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,000
different resolution

2142
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,520
as far as the pixels are uh

2143
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,440
the retinal detection units are

2144
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,280
concerned in this phobia in the center

2145
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,880
of the eye versus the periphery

2146
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,800
so that to me is demonstrative that

2147
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,920
we're experiencing

2148
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,760
our degenerative model of the world

2149
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,120
which is that the world has similar

2150
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,719
resolution no matter which way my head

2151
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:49,679
is looking

2152
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,320
and there's color everywhere and then

2153
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,920
subconsciously or sub

2154
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,719
personally our eyes are engaged in an

2155
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,920
oculomotor

2156
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,320
informational foraging task and where do

2157
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,520
the eyes secade

2158
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,280
it turns out that they look where the

2159
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,679
most informative place to look would be

2160
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,679
given the structure of this bayesian

2161
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,920
algorithm so so many things that are

2162
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,400
suggested with just this architecture

2163
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,480
and there's so many aspects of

2164
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,880
the signal processing cascade and

2165
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,560
especially the top down priors

2166
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,640
that aren't reflected by this idea that

2167
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,480
the eye is a camera and the brain is a

2168
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,120
cpu

2169
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,440
and it's just doing image classification

2170
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,199
like a convolutional neural network

2171
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,120
there are convolutional elements to be

2172
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,719
sure in vision but they're

2173
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,719
playing out in this type of framework

2174
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,280
not in a tic-tac-toe framework

2175
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,480
yeah absolutely um couldn't agree more

2176
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,360
with that that's

2177
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,560
uh that's a great point i mean uh the i

2178
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,040
think an

2179
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,600
often overlooked element of this picture

2180
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,600
is that it's not just saying

2181
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,679
like this is a criticism of bottom-up

2182
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,120
passive

2183
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,960
you know a passive picture of the brain

2184
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,840
that just kind of bottom up

2185
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,600
aggregates uh you know simple properties

2186
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
until you get something like a percept

2187
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
it's so we're not just saying that this

2188
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,360
is a top-down approach

2189
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,520
it's the bi-directional processing

2190
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,280
cascade that really gets you

2191
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,560
uh where you want to go ultimately

2192
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
and you know as you were just saying uh

2193
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,679
dan like you know

2194
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,640
the the experience that we're having

2195
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,400
implicates all these different levels

2196
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,960
and it's precisely because this whole

2197
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,120
multi-level architecture is implicated

2198
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,960
at all times that you get this kind of

2199
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,080
rich

2200
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,719
uh you know equally multi-level

2201
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,960
experience

2202
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,360
cool maybe we can turn to this last

2203
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,159
figure

2204
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,400
for the last section of our discussion

2205
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,000
so now we've built out

2206
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
this bayesian framework from the

2207
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
previous images first from its most

2208
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,719
austere

2209
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,199
framing to something that looks a little

2210
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:46,640
bit more naturalistic

2211
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,320
and now we're going to bring it back to

2212
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,840
our discussion about

2213
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,040
culture and about expectations norms and

2214
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,320
affordances

2215
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,040
so here we have the same structure where

2216
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,960
we have predictions moving

2217
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,000
down and prediction errors moving up or

2218
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,440
in or out these are just spatial

2219
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,280
metaphors and there's only in and out

2220
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,040
there isn't top or bottom

2221
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,520
and then we're adding a few more levels

2222
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,960
of details to the model

2223
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,360
the first is this blue and that's the

2224
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,080
precision

2225
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,560
weighting and so that's entering this

2226
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,880
hierarchy at a few different places

2227
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,360
and it's tuning the temperature so to

2228
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,159
speak

2229
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,520
on the precision so how much should we

2230
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,000
value how much stock should we take

2231
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,960
about this

2232
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,040
uh information that's coming up although

2233
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,719
there's a lot more nuance there

2234
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,719
and then also there's a top-down

2235
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,480
modulation of attention

2236
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,920
and that's where this regime of

2237
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,520
attention enters so

2238
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,679
the precision story is really key to all

2239
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,360
this and you know honestly

2240
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,000
as i was learning this framework uh you

2241
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,920
know like five years ago initially i was

2242
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,760
hoping that the precision stuff wouldn't

2243
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,520
be so central to the argument because

2244
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,120
it's really complicated

2245
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,920
but uh it turns out that it you get you

2246
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,440
get some of the most interesting

2247
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,679
effects from uh the precision stuff so

2248
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,600
it's it's it's a little bit

2249
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,360
it's a little bit difficult sometimes to

2250
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,640
wrap your head around but i think the

2251
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,920
effort is worth it

2252
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,000
the the idea is just to say at every

2253
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,080
level of the hierarchy

2254
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,920
the the brain doesn't just register a

2255
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,560
signal but it evaluates how confident

2256
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,640
or relia it is in that signal or how

2257
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,480
reliable the signal is and this is what

2258
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,120
this precision construct effectively

2259
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,159
uh quantifies and you know uh dan you

2260
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,440
were relating this to temperature

2261
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,040
informally that's correct

2262
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,600
uh a more intuitive way perhaps of

2263
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,560
framing it is as

2264
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,120
volume so it's sort of like the the

2265
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,640
brain's volume

2266
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,360
on each of its different kind of sensory

2267
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,320
streams

2268
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,560
so sensory and predictive streams

2269
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,480
effectively

2270
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,159
and yeah so uh precision waiting is what

2271
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,960
uh allows you to according to this story

2272
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,679
at least

2273
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,840
arbitrate uh different sources of

2274
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,880
information so for example 2018 2019 i

2275
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,400
spent a lot of time in london

2276
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,600
and london was surprisingly foggy um so

2277
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,600
it it so far i mean as a canadian i

2278
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,960
never experienced anything

2279
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,719
like this i think once when i was a

2280
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,560
child there was just so much fog

2281
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,239
and there were days when i would come

2282
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,600
out of my flat

2283
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,000
in london and i couldn't see two feet

2284
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,719
ahead of me

2285
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,920
there was so much fog and so uh you know

2286
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,840
in in circumstances like that what you

2287
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,600
learn to do is to rely on your other

2288
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,280
senses like you're hearing for example

2289
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,159
so there's a

2290
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:23,760
there's a story about the way that the

2291
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,159
brain is kind of dynamically it's sort

2292
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,440
of like a dynamic

2293
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,239
balancing act in a sense the brain is

2294
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,120
trying to

2295
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,679
see which which of the signals that it's

2296
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:34,800
dealing with

2297
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,239
are the most reliable um so i'll stop

2298
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,280
now richard has yeah

2299
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,000
yeah so and this is the the criticism i

2300
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,719
get a lot

2301
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,320
uh when i present at conferences and

2302
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,480
even when i publish on ideas related to

2303
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,040
this

2304
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,280
in the sense of you know if i'm let's

2305
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,880
imagine i'm a master burglar

2306
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
and i i walk into a neighborhood and i'm

2307
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,320
looking i'm chasing the neighborhood to

2308
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,280
find out what i want to

2309
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,960
what i want to break into which house i

2310
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,719
want to break into and so i have these

2311
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,560
priors i had the sensory information

2312
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,560
highly motivated to steal things and

2313
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,080
then there's always that old guy in the

2314
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,159
back who raises his hand and says that's

2315
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,239
really cool so how do i test any of that

2316
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,640
how what do i measure what variables do

2317
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,679
i need to collect

2318
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,120
and if at the end of the day all you're

2319
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,960
giving me is a more refined version of

2320
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,120
what i'm already talking about

2321
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,640
who cares and i i my gut tells me that's

2322
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,520
wrong that

2323
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,880
i mean as we clean in all these

2324
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,880
different disciplines we can go back and

2325
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,320
forth and translate

2326
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,480
you know our concepts back and forth and

2327
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,760
see that we're all talking about the

2328
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,719
same thing

2329
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,320
but if it doesn't lead to something

2330
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,400
empirical that then we can then start

2331
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,679
doing critical tests

2332
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:40,000
and show this version of the theory is

2333
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,040
wrong because

2334
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,120
my predictive priors or whatever would

2335
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,560
have looked differently if it had been

2336
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,520
that way

2337
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,520
so i i guess like to me that's the thing

2338
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,199
that i i'm always struggling with it and

2339
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,880
i'm hoping i can get some insight from

2340
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,239
everyone here is

2341
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,040
how do we translate this figure six into

2342
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,719
an empirical test that i can write up

2343
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,080
for an nsf grant

2344
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,800
and then gather data and show my theory

2345
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,840
is right

2346
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,080
parsons from 1950 was wrong right or

2347
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,920
something

2348
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,880
that's a great question um i think the

2349
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,159
where this has been done

2350
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,600
the most extensively is in psychiatry

2351
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,639
uh where and this is why you know

2352
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,360
uh this is what really drove the message

2353
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,080
home for me

2354
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,320
that the precision story was so central

2355
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,199
to this

2356
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,239
is that you can understand a lot of uh

2357
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,360
psychiatric conditions uh in terms of

2358
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,000
uh you know altered precision weighting

2359
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,440
profiles

2360
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,719
um so like uh

2361
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,719
i think a kind of well understood

2362
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,960
example has to do with the cycle the

2363
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,120
course of schizophrenia

2364
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,400
uh so we think that and phil corlet

2365
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,760
uh has great work on this uh i mean

2366
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,719
several people uh have worked on this uh

2367
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,520
from different kind of perspectives but

2368
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,360
all kind of relying on

2369
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,840
this construct of precision and backing

2370
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,400
it that

2371
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,120
then backing it up with fmri data so the

2372
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,840
course of

2373
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,080
schizophrenia for example it's thought

2374
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,840
to maybe start out as

2375
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,320
a you know a break a physiological break

2376
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,400
in your dopamine signaling so say d2

2377
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,440
receptors

2378
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,600
start to misfire for no reason so

2379
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,040
they're generating

2380
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,880
uh what we would consider to be a

2381
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
spurious prediction error so like a

2382
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,159
prediction error that isn't really

2383
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,600
tracking anything

2384
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,280
and initially this gets resolved

2385
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,600
perceptually in the lower levels of the

2386
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
hierarchy it's kind of contained through

2387
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,880
hallucination

2388
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,320
like the brain is generating a

2389
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,560
prediction error signal and what it what

2390
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
it ends up doing

2391
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,760
is underweighting uh its priors are

2392
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,639
overweighting

2393
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,719
its prediction error uh because that's

2394
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,159
essentially what's going on like there's

2395
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,840
a breakdown and these prediction errors

2396
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,440
that aren't tracking anything are given

2397
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,080
too much

2398
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,800
uh importance and as the condition

2399
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,400
worsens they're given more and more

2400
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,560
importance because they're consistent

2401
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,480
like the brain is just consistently

2402
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
generating this prediction error

2403
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,840
and at some point it gets so it

2404
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,679
intense in the brain that it starts to

2405
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,360
be resolved through learning

2406
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,280
rather than through a hallucination so

2407
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,560
then you know

2408
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,639
for those of you who do a little bit of

2409
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,560
research in psychiatry you'll know that

2410
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,679
there is a typical course of

2411
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,920
schizophrenia that starts off as a more

2412
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,480
kind of

2413
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,480
hallucination experience where people

2414
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,320
are still to some degree

2415
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,840
cognizant of the fact that they're

2416
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,199
they're undergoing an abnormal

2417
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,880
experience and they're hallucinating

2418
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,639
but late stage you know uh schizophrenia

2419
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,960
has more to do with uh persistent

2420
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,400
delusional beliefs

2421
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,320
and now your actual cognitive structure

2422
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,400
is adapting to the error signals that

2423
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,800
you're generating and learning from

2424
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
learning the error essentially uh which

2425
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,880
is not tracking anything in reality

2426
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,040
because it's just due to a breakdown

2427
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,000
so from that point of view uh to answer

2428
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,480
the

2429
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,719
well to to address the points that you

2430
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,080
just raised richard the

2431
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,199
i think the uh like a lot of the power

2432
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,320
of the approach

2433
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,920
in terms of proof of principle comes

2434
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,520
from psychiatry

2435
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,280
these predictions uh and precisions

2436
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,760
are are computed by parts of the brain

2437
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,040
that you can identify

2438
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,320
and so phil corlet i think in particular

2439
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,040
has done uh some really really cool work

2440
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:17,440
uh

2441
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,719
on um on hallucinate uh on the

2442
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,199
uh on schizophrenia and the uh

2443
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,800
effectively the

2444
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,120
kind of uh presentation of schizophrenia

2445
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,360
and the chorus of schizophrenia

2446
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,880
very cool work from that point of view

2447
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,960
it feels at yale uh for those of you who

2448
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,360
are

2449
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,159
interested cool um steven and then we'll

2450
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,920
return to the unique

2451
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,600
predictions question yeah i suppose just

2452
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,639
adding to that

2453
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,840
um this this challenge of

2454
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,880
things happening over time like a time

2455
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,400
series of things happening

2456
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,040
rather than kind of some snapshot in

2457
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,480
time which i think

2458
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,320
traditionally a lot of research sort of

2459
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,560
does that so

2460
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,639
even what maxwell was saying there is

2461
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,679
what's presented as a pattern over time

2462
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,840
if you took one moment it might not show

2463
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,679
that and i think that's where

2464
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:11,840
it's kind of hard to analyze that that's

2465
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,719
why these

2466
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,159
models that they create show how things

2467
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,440
pan out over time on a low

2468
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,760
dimensionality

2469
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,760
and then you can get something from that

2470
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,960
and i'm kind of

2471
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,360
that does present a problem about real

2472
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,040
life scenarios and i'm

2473
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,360
my i'm interested in whether maybe

2474
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,199
approaching it from the direction of

2475
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,120
affordances and the environment and

2476
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,880
working backwards

2477
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,480
to how people are tuned to an

2478
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,080
environment might be the way to look at

2479
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,360
the more macro

2480
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,159
because it becomes so high dimensional

2481
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,760
if you take someone

2482
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,920
at the individual level but i think this

2483
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,679
is up for grabs

2484
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,000
let's bring that back to the question

2485
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,719
about

2486
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,600
crime uh by richard so let's think about

2487
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,960
the shared expectations

2488
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,199
so the shared expectations might be

2489
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,320
people don't

2490
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,320
walk uh onto someone else's private

2491
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,639
property so in that case even somebody

2492
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,639
who's highly motivated and has the tools

2493
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,840
the affordance to

2494
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,880
do a burglary there's still uncertainty

2495
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,239
about what's inside the house

2496
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,080
now let's imagine changing the norm so

2497
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,400
that people are have wide windows and

2498
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,080
you can see exactly which house has

2499
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,480
which

2500
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,639
uh equipment now somebody who's

2501
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,560
motivated and with the affordance

2502
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,880
is enabled by a cultural norm that

2503
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,040
allows passing close to the window

2504
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,719
as well as an architectural affordance

2505
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,239
to see inside the house

2506
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,960
they're reducing their uncertainty about

2507
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,400
what's inside of the house

2508
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,800
and that is going to change not just

2509
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,320
that agent's behavior

2510
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,719
in their own field of affordances but

2511
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,320
also some macro

2512
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,960
trends and so this is in one sense this

2513
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,600
is

2514
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,120
looking at within the brain these are

2515
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,040
different neuronal populations

2516
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,639
and that would be precision could be

2517
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,480
played by uh dopamine

2518
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,320
and by dopaminergic synapses like

2519
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,760
maxwell's talking about

2520
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,280
and personally i find it fascinating

2521
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,679
that so many stories about reward

2522
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,120
like oh well gambling is about people

2523
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,719
trying to maximize reward or

2524
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,080
bank robberies about people trying to

2525
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,840
maximize reward really

2526
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,520
is it though or is it about people

2527
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,760
optimizing their precision or perhaps

2528
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,560
even operating under maladaptive uh

2529
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,440
precision

2530
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,080
regimes so it doesn't have just because

2531
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,280
it's an optimization

2532
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,639
and a precision oriented framework

2533
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,320
doesn't mean that aberrant events

2534
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,800
don't happen so within the brain level

2535
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,000
we can think about that type of

2536
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,719
precision

2537
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,639
but then also socially what is the

2538
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,239
feedback that somebody receives

2539
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,960
along the way that have has other people

2540
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,480
give them feedback to keep them

2541
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,440
uh on the straight and narrow as it were

2542
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:33,920
and then

2543
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,480
how do we as cultures define what that

2544
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,360
path is

2545
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,760
are there on-ramps from the fringes of

2546
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,560
society

2547
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,040
that help onboard people into a healthy

2548
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,239
and cooperative

2549
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,520
way of living or do we push people who

2550
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,400
even deviate in some way out of the

2551
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,320
center where they're even more likely to

2552
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,440
deviate further

2553
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,360
from the increasingly narrow perspective

2554
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,840
of the center so there's really so many

2555
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,960
levels that this can come into play

2556
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,199
at so i think just because of the time

2557
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,120
let's have a few closing thoughts from

2558
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,719
anybody who would like to share

2559
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,679
and then also please through text if

2560
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:12,639
you're listening as well as

2561
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,520
participating

2562
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,480
submit us questions or topics or quotes

2563
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,920
because we have a bunch of quotes that

2564
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,960
we've selected

2565
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,960
and some other things that we felt like

2566
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,400
we could have spent more time

2567
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,639
talking about but we'll save that for

2568
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,960
next week with this first week's podcast

2569
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,760
being the figures the definitions the

2570
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,520
on-ramps and the accessibility

2571
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,120
from a lot of different fields and then

2572
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,719
the next week we'll bridge out even

2573
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:35,280
further

2574
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:39,840
so any closing thoughts from our

2575
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,840
participants

2576
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,159
shannon i think that's a really good

2577
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:55,040
point that question of how do you study

2578
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,679
this

2579
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,960
you know how how is how do you bring

2580
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,199
this entire story of

2581
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,639
the free energy principle or predictive

2582
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,239
processing or act of inference and

2583
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,000
actually study it in

2584
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,120
a social context like in a group of

2585
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,880
people so not just the stationary

2586
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,520
burglar who's alone in a neighborhood at

2587
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,320
night but

2588
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,120
in the context of a group of people who

2589
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,960
are interacting

2590
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,960
and i think that would be a really great

2591
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,080
topic for

2592
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,080
part of next week or like when we

2593
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,440
revisit

2594
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,320
and just you know a plug from music

2595
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,440
that's a great

2596
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,480
uh little model system

2597
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,040
to study these kind of interactions um

2598
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,600
and

2599
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,719
starting from western music just because

2600
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,440
i grew up here and that's kind of music

2601
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,120
i've interacted with but if you have an

2602
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,560
ensemble you know

2603
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,560
who are the leaders of the ensemble who

2604
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,000
are the followers

2605
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,719
and you can kind of manipulate that um

2606
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,000
and

2607
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,800
really study how you can play with

2608
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,320
changing the regimes of attention or

2609
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,040
changing

2610
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,920
who in the group dictates uh what the

2611
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,440
particular field

2612
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,040
of affordance is that this piece of

2613
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,120
music needs to play

2614
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,600
um and there are a lot of really

2615
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,360
exciting and fun ways to get creative in

2616
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,960
the lab to study these kind of social

2617
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,360
exchanges and maybe put some of these

2618
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,000
um super complex mathematical models to

2619
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,560
like bring it give it some empirical

2620
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,560
testing

2621
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,239
great richard anyone else can raise

2622
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,679
their hand as well yeah

2623
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,520
uh building off that i think that's a

2624
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,880
great idea to talk about people in

2625
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,159
groups and you know the things that i've

2626
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,920
seen coming out with with hyperscanning

2627
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,440
and the ability to have

2628
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,199
two three four or five people all being

2629
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,560
scanned at the same time whether

2630
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,239
socially interacting and

2631
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,639
and then asking okay so what is this

2632
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,159
mathematical model

2633
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,000
of the free energy principle or active

2634
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,360
inference or whatever embedded an

2635
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,400
individual

2636
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
how does it what i mean does it come

2637
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,760
down to a couple of oscillators i mean

2638
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,040
that's the thing i keep coming back to

2639
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,840
you is this right

2640
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,679
this is just another version of coupled

2641
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,360
oscillators and if that's

2642
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,679
true then the notion of how do i

2643
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,679
empirically deal with this is because

2644
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,400
these coupled models can deal with 10 15

2645
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,199
20

2646
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,440
1 000 people interacting that our

2647
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,120
current concepts in sociology we can

2648
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,880
talk about abstractly but no one can

2649
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,120
really figure out a way to measure it so

2650
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,800
i think that'd be really interesting to

2651
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,320
look at the intersection between the

2652
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,360
models

2653
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,120
our our current scanning abilities and

2654
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,960
empirical design and the theory

2655
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,440
and really see where they what are they

2656
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,719
talking about and what is a more

2657
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,159
unified you know operationalization of

2658
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,040
these concepts

2659
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,800
in light of this technology and these

2660
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,239
models what would that look like in

2661
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,159
terms of experimental design

2662
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,719
that's really exciting um i'll i'll try

2663
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:35,840
to rejoin uh

2664
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,600
because my camera crashed again after

2665
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,120
this comment but i wanted to say to both

2666
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,560
of you shannon and richard if these are

2667
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,000
lines of research that you're interested

2668
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,440
in exploring this is definitely

2669
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,360
something that my group is

2670
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,159
very keen on exploring uh i mean you're

2671
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,920
talking about hyper scanning i really

2672
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,120
think this is the direction

2673
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,400
ford uh we're working with uh a few

2674
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,120
people

2675
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,719
now uh so robin murphy

2676
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,800
uh santiago castillo uh

2677
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,600
in particular are all people who do eeg

2678
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,760
and fmri hyper scanning

2679
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,320
and uh the the new kind of thing that

2680
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,080
we're trying to do is uh to combine

2681
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:14,960
multi-agent

2682
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,239
modeling with uh multi-brain

2683
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,719
neuro imaging you know because the

2684
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:21,520
problem with

2685
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,520
that i have with social neuroscience is

2686
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,960
that we're

2687
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,639
and i'm sure those of you who do social

2688
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,760
sciences will concur

2689
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,840
they're what we're essentially doing is

2690
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
looking at the brain with this

2691
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,040
really deep level of you know

2692
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,800
inquiry we're you know we're looking at

2693
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,360
like

2694
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,080
hundreds of different uh sensors on the

2695
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,440
scalp or whatever

2696
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,280
and so we have all of these this brain

2697
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,120
data that we're looking at but really

2698
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,040
when we're looking at like the kind of

2699
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,639
social measures that we're using it's

2700
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,400
it's these kind of toy measures like

2701
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,080
empathy or whatever that are supposed to

2702
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,760
tell us like something broad about

2703
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,920
culture and the problem with that is

2704
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,280
that we're effectively

2705
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,600
flattening all of the causal structure

2706
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,040
and complexity

2707
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,880
of the social world onto these kind of

2708
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,880
toy dummy variables that are supposed to

2709
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,560
tell us something really deep about

2710
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,760
uh you know social interactions and

2711
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,760
uh by combining this multi-scale

2712
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,600
perspective opened up by the free energy

2713
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,239
principle

2714
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,880
with uh hyper scanning and other uh

2715
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,639
social neuroscience techniques

2716
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,080
we're hoping to really be able to uh

2717
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,560
talk about and understand and model the

2718
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,360
social world

2719
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,920
in all its complexity while also looking

2720
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,719
at

2721
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,679
uh brain dynamics so i have people for

2722
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,120
example interact in

2723
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,600
ecologically realistic situations for

2724
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,719
humans

2725
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:43,120
uh and then see stuff about you know

2726
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:43,920
like uh

2727
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,840
so edwileck for example if you don't

2728
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,360
know her you should absolutely check out

2729
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,159
her work

2730
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,080
um e-d-d-a-b-i-l-e-k

2731
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,719
edward she's currently carl fristan's

2732
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:55,920
postdoc

2733
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,639
uh and i think she's also at mannheim in

2734
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,440
germany

2735
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,120
and what she's developed is uh

2736
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,520
effectively a measure of brain to brain

2737
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,320
synchrony or uh brain tumor real-time

2738
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,679
brain-to-brain information

2739
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,719
transfer and you can get to this by

2740
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,600
uh looking at basically real-time

2741
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,880
interactions

2742
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,840
between humans uh you know engaging in

2743
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,120
some kind of shared

2744
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,199
participatory task like you know

2745
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,280
aligning gaze direction or whatever

2746
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,040
and simultaneously recording their

2747
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,040
brains as they interact

2748
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,560
and i really think that this is like the

2749
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,560
golden way forward so if any of you

2750
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,320
actually are interested in pursuing this

2751
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:32,960
please uh

2752
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,679
send me a dm or something and we can get

2753
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,120
started

2754
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,520
perfect and i'll just close i think with

2755
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,800
one short note on

2756
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,080
flattening versus deflationary theory

2757
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,719
because it really does come back to what

2758
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:47,600
are we doing here

2759
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,280
is this another metaphor and it's just

2760
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,800
pendulums on a table

2761
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,400
um or is there something actually more

2762
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,239
here and flattening

2763
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,159
maxwell was suggesting is when we're

2764
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,239
just projecting that's psychological as

2765
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,679
well as a dimensional term

2766
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,239
we project onto simple constructs we

2767
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,520
want to have a simple

2768
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,520
concept of empathy and in a sense by

2769
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,920
projecting into that representation

2770
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,920
at a lower dimension we've created a

2771
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,000
world that isn't necessarily reflective

2772
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,679
of the whole system

2773
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,239
in uh in contrast with a flattening

2774
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:17,040
account

2775
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,120
we can have a deflation a deflationary

2776
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,040
account where what's happening is really

2777
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,320
communicating brains

2778
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,000
it's really just those brains

2779
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,239
communicating and we're deflating away

2780
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,239
the extra the second level where is the

2781
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:29,760
empathy where's the regime

2782
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,239
where's the attention the answer is it's

2783
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,280
the whole system

2784
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,800
and it's not just the whole system

2785
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,480
meaning the person it's the whole system

2786
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,000
with the niche and the culture

2787
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,560
and so it's a lot to grasp grasp with

2788
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,199
because

2789
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,760
it is a multi-level system and we can

2790
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,760
design an experiment that isolates

2791
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,840
a certain component but we never truly

2792
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,520
have isolated from the evolutionary

2793
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,760
context or the developmental context

2794
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,800
and so the goal to pursue

2795
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,000
inflationary rich accounts that provide

2796
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,360
all of these humanistic things that we

2797
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,159
want to see

2798
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,320
like inactive embodied in cultured

2799
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,679
cognition

2800
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,679
rather than flattening it onto something

2801
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:06,800
and then saying well maybe they're the

2802
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,159
same between different cultures

2803
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,880
we can actually go into that richness

2804
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,199
and

2805
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,280
look at what we actually have and

2806
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,840
stephen with a closing thought

2807
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,719
yeah thanks i totally agree and i like

2808
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,159
this idea of being able to

2809
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:23,360
feel where we look this idea of feeling

2810
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,080
texture

2811
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,920
it would be sort of analogous to that

2812
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,320
because you have empathy and someone

2813
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,080
like i work a lot in the development

2814
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,080
field and community work and

2815
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,679
you get this idea of empathy but there's

2816
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,400
no time variation and empathy it's just

2817
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:36,960
like

2818
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,280
dump there resistance and it's like well

2819
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,040
how is that changing

2820
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,560
moments moment isn't there's none of

2821
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,800
that no one really thinks about that

2822
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,960
how things change over time so i think

2823
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,679
this this is actually really useful

2824
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,520
it's clarified a lot of stuff in my head

2825
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,960
actually just hearing

2826
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,840
that discussion about i think it's a

2827
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,159
different way of thinking about

2828
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,320
looking normally all that granularity

2829
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,280
would be seen

2830
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,920
as a problem but actually it can be seen

2831
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,480
as

2832
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,920
data which is really cool beautiful

2833
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,440
maxwell first author last thought

2834
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,520
i just wanna it's less of a thought than

2835
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,760
a feeling i just wanted to re-express my

2836
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,040
gratitude to everyone in the

2837
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,920
conversation

2838
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,280
um this is really exciting and

2839
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,480
awesome and uh like yeah

2840
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,920
i i so if anyone does want to

2841
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,760
develop these ideas like i was saying

2842
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,280
please get in touch with me

2843
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,560
and uh our our group is very keen on

2844
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,800
collaborating with the we've established

2845
