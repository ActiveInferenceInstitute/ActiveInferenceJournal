1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,559
all right i think we are live

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,759
hello everyone and welcome to team com

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
podcast 4.2

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
this is an exciting day because we are

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,000
testing out new technology

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
and so thanks to all of our participants

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
we hope this works for all of you

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,680
listening and in attendance

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
let's go to the slides welcome to

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
teamcomp teamcom is an experiment in

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
online team communication

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
and learning related to active inference

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
you can find us on twitter at our

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
this is a recorded and archived live

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,520
stream

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,199
so please provide us with feedback so we

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
can improve on our work

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,039
all backgrounds and perspectives are

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
welcome here we welcome

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,239
all questions that can help people

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,079
understand active inference

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
and as far as basic video etiquette

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
please mute if it's noisy in your

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,560
background

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
feel free to use the raise hand feature

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
in jitsi so that we can

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,119
make sure to call on you we are here in

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
active inference stream 4.2 following up

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,520
on 4.1

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
in 4.1 we discussed cultural affordances

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
scaffolding local worlds through shared

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,880
intentionality and regimes of attention

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
a 2016 paper by ramstead at all

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
today we're going to do a check-in and

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,479
warm-up

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,119
and last time we had a discussion of the

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,360
daniel

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
we can see slice by now

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,399
yes okay good point i can see the slides

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,840
on the live stream

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
but uh they're not being shared in the

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,880
jitsi

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
so what i'm going to do and we're um

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
doing it live i'm going to post the

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
live stream link and if you'd like you

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
could have the live stream

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
muted in the background and just see

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,920
what the slides are because it will just

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,799
be rapidly

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
um following so i'll continue on this

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,119
first part and

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
the link will be dream

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
put into the jitsi chat if you could

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
just give me

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
one second how about something on active

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
inference and multitasking

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
that's what i want to know about

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
last time we had an awesome discussion

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,560
of the paper

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
we went through the abstract the claims

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
and the aims of the work

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
and we also went through all the figures

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
in pretty nice detail

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
this time we are going to have further

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
discussion which has been separated into

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000
a few different topics that

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
none of the conversions have been

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
prepared on beforehand so it will be

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,319
fun and improvisational so let's start

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,280
with the check-in

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
and warm-up people can introduce

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
themselves and their location if they'd

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,160
like

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
the first question is what is a local

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:05,599
world that you live in

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,920
any thoughts on local worlds

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,560
it's a good question um

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
i mean i i you know i guess this says

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
something about the way that

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
we live i mean you know i i live in

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,720
montreal

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
and my local world uh i live around the

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,080
mcgill

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
area so it's very studenty um

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
i guess i i live in a world where

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
people share progressive values and i

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,879
also get the feeling that there's

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,159
something like

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
a rift you know where where

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
several of us are sharing the same

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
geographical location um but don't

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
necessarily live in the same world

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
uh per se in the same in the sense of

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
the things don't afford the same kinds

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,400
of things

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
that they do uh it you know for

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
for other people living in another as it

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
were world

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
um yeah yep the first thing i thought of

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,599
was that local

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,239
can be geospatial or it can be

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,040
informational

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
one informational link away is just one

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,080
video chat away one phone call away

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,798
and what we're experiencing in a big way

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
is that tension between our

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
informational local worlds and our

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
spatial ones and

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
that can lead to um discordance

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
any other thoughts on this part

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,919
cool maybe uh

117
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,800
in this term of local maybe it's

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
based on communications which happens

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
most often with you

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
if even in a global environment but

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,240
if you communicate each day with

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
somebody

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,720
your kind of local world

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
cool second question what gives meaning

125
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
to our local worlds so this can be maybe

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,639
a thought from the paper

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,160
what did they propose gives meaning to

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
local worlds or just

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
experientially what is it that gives

130
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
meaning to your local world

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
yeah stephen well i think there's the

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
geographical

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
like physical embeddedness of that world

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
so how you actually when i think of

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
world i kind of think

136
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
very much of it in terms of the physical

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
space

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,720
being part of the of that whole piece

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,600
um but then like you say how those

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,320
things show up

141
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,639
then starts to become maybe more

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,160
abstract or more

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
inferred through other people

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
yep and from a process perspective as

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,320
we'll

146
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
get to later it's the feedback loops

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
that happen within ourself and amongst

148
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
various people that provide

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
semiotic meaning sasha

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
yeah for some reason i just thought of

151
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,720
this phrase like theory of place

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
kind of going along with theory of mind

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
that in this kind of

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
uh local information environment but

155
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
maybe not

156
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
geospatially local that the people that

157
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,000
you're communicating

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
with you may or may not know where

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
they're

160
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
communicating from and that um

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
could be helpful in your communication

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
or not because um

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
simply because we're all here on this

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
live stream we don't really need to know

165
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
the exact location of each of the

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
participants

167
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,800
but if i did know it might add something

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
to our communication

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
or the narrative that we're building

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
to kind of know where we can all connect

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
from

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
and then to follow up with the thinking

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
through other minds

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
idea it's like thinking through other

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
spaces it's about putting yourself

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,039
in someone else's shoes understanding

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,479
where they're coming from

178
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
these are embodied and spatial metaphors

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
that we use

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
just like can you grasp it can you

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
sketch out the idea

182
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
these are tactile ways to talk about

183
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
abstract things like ideas

184
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
and so you're literally putting yourself

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,280
in someone else's shoes if you ask

186
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
what is the accessibility of this room

187
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
going to be for somebody who's coming

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
from a different place

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
and these are the important things to

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,039
consider

191
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
and we'll return to this i think when we

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
talk about the third space that exists

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,840
in social interactions

194
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
um in terms of the uh the paper cultural

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,599
affordances the

196
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
proposal there is something like well

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
um what what's at stake is something

198
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
like a dialectic

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
between affordances and expectations

200
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
right so

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,400
uh what what ends up shaping the

202
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
the worlds the that we inhabit right

203
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
which which we're conceptualizing in

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
terms of affordances

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
um really are the the shared

206
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
expectations that we have uh you know

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
with with other people in our community

208
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
and by shared expectations i mean

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
something very broad

210
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,599
uh to encompass uh the beliefs that we

211
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,400
have about

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
uh the shared world but also the norms

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
uh that are

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
kind of structuring uh our appraisal and

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
interaction with

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
the world as well as practices that

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
might be ongoing

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
and crucially the the shared physical

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
environment

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
that we have in common that in in the

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
case of humans

222
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
comes to encode information about the

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
way that we live

224
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,039
so you know think about uh the fact that

225
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,080
in most cities

226
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,039
streets meet at right angles uh or you

227
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
know the

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,560
use of circular uh traffic signalization

229
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
uh to kind of coordinate our patterns of

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
movement throughout a city

231
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
i think what's at stake is really the

232
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
this dialectic

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
yep the ant colonies architecture is in

234
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
feedback with their behavior

235
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
and they're exactly updated and

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
generated by the very

237
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
same process which is nice construction

238
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
or distributed cognition

239
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
different contexts are going to have

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
different terms uh final warm-up

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,920
question

242
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
is what are you trying to get a grip on

243
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
this is looking forward to talking about

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
grip later on

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
in this discussion but what's just

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
something that you're trying to get a

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
grip on i just thought it'd be a fun

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
random question

249
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
one thing we were talking about just

250
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
right before we started was trying to

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,560
get a grip

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
on some of these formalisms and

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
understanding which formalisms

254
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
in the free energy principle and in

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,080
active inference are

256
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
downstream of each other which ones are

257
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,200
necessary or sufficient for each other

258
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,920
and also what is the best way to on-ramp

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,279
and to learn about them

260
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,560
from various different perspectives

261
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
i was going to say exactly that i was

262
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,519
going to talk about the reading group

263
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
and the progress that we're making there

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
uh yeah what have you found interesting

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
or liked about that

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
well i mean i didn't expect this to

267
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,120
really turn into

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,320
the rich discussion and exchange

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
community that it's turned into uh

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
i mean uh yeah we're really coming to

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
grips i think as a group with

272
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
uh with the basically all the math and

273
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,120
physics

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
that goes into it like really uh

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
becoming familiar with all the moving

276
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
parts and all the ingredients it's been

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
a really

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
positive experience so that's what we're

279
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
i guess i'm also trying to learn

280
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
that guitar a bit more that's another

281
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
thing i'm coming to literally

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
grips with but those are the two main

283
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
things i'd say nice and stephen do you

284
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
raise your hand

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
yeah i like well like you were so

286
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
talking about this idea of putting

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
yourself or getting in someone else's

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
shoes

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
so i'm trying to like put myself

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
or trying to understand to put myself in

291
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
someone someone else's shoes in terms of

292
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,959
understanding what i'm talking about

293
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,399
this stuff and then

294
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,360
i think the whole idea of like am i

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
trying to understand

296
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,120
um in this dialectic with someone else

297
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,399
where they are

298
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,399
in relation to me or am i actually

299
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
getting into their shoes

300
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,920
in a place or in a field of practice

301
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,000
or in some sort of stance in relation to

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
um some concepts so i think there's

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
something kind of about

304
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
actually how we try and understand what

305
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
it means

306
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
in a meta level like you know because

307
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
and how we move between them because we

308
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
i tend to find that a lot of

309
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
um the stuff like anthropology and that

310
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,839
it tends to have

311
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,040
particular metaphors that we end up all

312
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
having to follow

313
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,519
from gold or whoever and that's

314
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
particularly true in the arts

315
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
it's all like it's all to lose and to

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,560
lose and

317
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
lose and then everything's those

318
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
metaphors

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
so like how how do you jump in and out

320
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,279
of those

321
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
different sort of shoes that people are

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,720
in

323
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,279
i think that's really interesting yep

324
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,480
being specific

325
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
with generalizations being tangible with

326
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,079
the abstraction

327
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
those are tensions that we work with and

328
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
also one thought on local worlds and

329
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,760
getting a grip

330
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,079
so once there's a grip on the object it

331
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,279
becomes part of your

332
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
extended cognition if you have the grip

333
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
on the hammer you can hit the nail but

334
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,920
if you don't have a grip on the hammer

335
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
it's not part of your

336
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
affordances to nail that in with a

337
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
hammer or if you're in someone else's

338
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,360
shoes

339
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
the local world kind of becomes the foot

340
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,399
shoe

341
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
container and the local world is what

342
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,399
gives meaning to that

343
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,079
coupling between the foot and the shoe

344
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,760
between the hand and the hammer

345
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
and so in in just a spatial way but

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
perhaps also in an abstract way

347
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
the local world is tying back to the

348
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,440
affordance idea and upon that control

349
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
um idea sasha

350
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
sasha muted oh uh yeah just to add a

351
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
little uh you know metal level

352
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,519
uh comment on that um the way that we

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
communicate um right it

354
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
has to capture the content of what we're

355
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
trying to communicate

356
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
and then also in a way that makes sense

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,720
to

358
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
uh the receiving party but it's just

359
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,480
funny especially

360
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
on this sort of podcast conversation

361
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,760
style that um

362
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
we're trying to communicate with each

363
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,680
other but also in a way that is going to

364
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
be

365
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,639
understandable to a future audience

366
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
and so i think there's a few different

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
levels of modulating

368
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
um our communication style and

369
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
um the kind of affordances that we have

370
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
perfect transition to our first bucket

371
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,639
of questions which is

372
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,959
feedback and affordances so on this one

373
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
this slide has a picture of a termite

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,560
nest

375
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
it also has a picture of some brain

376
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,320
computer

377
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
images and there's a quote from the

378
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
paper it reads

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,839
this multi-level embodiment of the

380
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,880
generative model

381
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
as we shall argue below extends to the

382
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
concrete material

383
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
human design milieus or designer

384
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
environments in which humans operate

385
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,160
some generative models in this wide

386
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
sense involve semantic content and

387
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,199
others do not

388
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
they involve something more minimal than

389
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
satisfaction conditions

390
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
i.e reliable covariation so

391
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
my question which is pretty broad was

392
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,440
what does active inference

393
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
tell us about niche construction in the

394
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,680
physical sense or in the cultural sense

395
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
there's a lot to say there and there

396
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,079
were many subsequent papers

397
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,760
um well i mean if if i can just uh make

398
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,959
a few points uh

399
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
to get us started um so

400
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,360
axel constant and yellow brinaberg i

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
think are the two

402
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
first people to really start working on

403
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
the niche construction aspect

404
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,320
of active inference back in 2017 or so

405
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
and so all this work rests on the fact

406
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
that whenever we're talking about

407
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
active inference we're talking about a

408
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,560
story that's symmetric

409
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,000
in some deep sense so active inference

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,519
is a story about how

411
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
uh organisms over the course of uh

412
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
you know development and uh

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
and learning and through perception and

414
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
processes like evolution

415
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
become more like their ecological niche

416
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,639
which

417
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,800
technically means that their statistical

418
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
structure comes to recapitulate

419
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
uh in some sense the structure of the

420
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,040
environment

421
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
uh in which uh the you know the

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
organisms that we're interested in

423
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
exist um so for example uh

424
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,519
you know you can tell a lot about my

425
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,959
environment just by looking at my

426
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,000
physical body right

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
so the fact that i'm wearing a parka

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
tells you that summer's over in canada

429
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
for example so there are these kind of

430
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,639
predictive relations between the state

431
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,600
of my phenotype

432
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,120
and the expected state of the

433
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,279
environment to kind of come together

434
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
so the other side of active inference

435
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
that's often emphasizes the active bit

436
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
so you know rather than making my

437
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
beliefs more like the environment i can

438
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,399
make my environment more like my beliefs

439
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,040
or

440
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,199
conformed to my preferred data

441
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,120
distributions

442
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
what was overlooked before 2017 is that

443
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
from the point of view of the organism

444
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
and environment the story is symmetric

445
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
so when we're making the environment

446
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
more like our preferred data

447
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,839
distributions

448
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
as an active inference we're effectively

449
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
changing the structure of enviro of the

450
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,519
environment

451
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,680
to to make it more like our own

452
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,199
structure or to make it like

453
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
the the like the structure of the the

454
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
preferences that we're encoding

455
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
um and so uh i think a lot of

456
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
a lot of the more interesting work done

457
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,720
on culture

458
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
recently in the active inference

459
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
tradition draws

460
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
on uh this niche construction stuff i

461
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
mean you know at some point the idea is

462
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
you've only got so many layers of cortex

463
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,039
and cortex cortex is metabolically

464
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,839
expensive

465
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,640
so where are you gonna keep optimizing

466
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
you know after like the sixth layer

467
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
or whatever of like increasingly meta

468
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,240
increasingly centralized uh

469
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
representation well one way to go is

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
really just in the environment

471
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
so there's a there's a sense in which

472
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,120
really like coordinating

473
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,080
amongst amongst con specifics you know

474
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,799
like uh

475
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,360
or or with a team member or whatever is

476
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,320
sort of like

477
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
constructing a niche in another person

478
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
in a sense you're sort of like

479
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,240
you know uploading into another person

480
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,520
the sets of priors that will optimally

481
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,400
allow you to interface together uh which

482
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
relates to some of the top top effects

483
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,200
that we were discussing last week

484
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
so i mean ultimately the picture that i

485
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,120
kind of draw

486
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,919
for multi-scale active inference is that

487
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,280
you have two stacks

488
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
essentially you've got a kind of

489
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,960
vertical stack and a horizontal stack

490
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,799
by vertical stack i mean that all the

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,480
systems that we're considering are

492
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
nested systems of systems of systems

493
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
right so

494
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,440
uh you know our bodies are made of

495
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
organs that are made of cells and so on

496
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,799
um or you know uh the broader uh

497
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,400
socio-economic uh community in north

498
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
america is made up of like you know

499
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
more regional groups like the u.s canada

500
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
mexico

501
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
which in turn are made up of you know so

502
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
you got these kind of nested

503
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,520
uh structures going and

504
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
the yeah the active inference

505
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,280
story then can be used to

506
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,600
i think make sense of the ways in which

507
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
we structure the environment especially

508
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,960
humans this is

509
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
especially the case for humans that we

510
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
structure the environment in order to

511
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,520
foster

512
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,280
adaptive patterns of group behavior

513
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
any other thoughts on that and i can add

514
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
as well

515
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,160
well and raise your hand if so one part

516
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
that i thought was really interesting

517
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
maxwell was this notion of like a deep

518
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,799
symmetry

519
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
especially when the two interacting

520
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,520
components of the system have very

521
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
different affordances

522
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
so i was thinking about winter just like

523
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,400
you brought up

524
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
we don't recapitulate uh snow or

525
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,039
cold weathers however we do come to

526
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,679
embody

527
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,160
those regularities in the day and in the

528
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,039
year

529
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,160
with our first our thermoregulation as

530
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
an organism and then

531
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,400
with our behavior and with our extended

532
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
phenotype with our buildings and with

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,679
our air conditioners

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,400
and so we do in a very deep sense come

535
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
to embody those regularities

536
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
and then the air conditioners change the

537
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
climate in some

538
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,679
sense maybe a little maybe a lot maybe

539
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,039
it's in a good direction maybe it's in a

540
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,000
bad direction

541
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
but there is a consequence of this

542
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
coming to embody the regularities

543
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
and especially when the systems are very

544
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
different maybe when you're doing a

545
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,679
call and response it looks symmetrical

546
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,080
at the syntactic level and it has this

547
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
deep symmetry at the turn taking level

548
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
and then with other systems where the

549
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,200
where the turn taking looks very

550
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,600
different

551
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
it's still something symmetrical but

552
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,640
it's not quite

553
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
symmetrical at the first pass right well

554
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
so the the uh the idea was i was trying

555
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,200
to

556
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
uh elaborate a bit earlier with this

557
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,440
vertical and horizontal stack is

558
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
touches precisely on this is that it's

559
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,360
not just that

560
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
organisms are stacked in this kind of

561
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,400
vertical

562
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
ways that you also have this kind of

563
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,159
horizontal relationship between an

564
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,039
organism

565
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
or an agent and its niche that turn out

566
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
to also be stacked in this kind of way

567
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,159
so it's not just that my cells make up

568
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,919
organs that make up organisms

569
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
that make up my body for instance it's

570
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
that my body is a niche for or

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
for my organs and my organs are a niche

572
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
for my cells

573
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,080
and so when we're talking about niche

574
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,400
construction it's very much as sasha was

575
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
describing a few a few moments ago it's

576
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
that we're thinking

577
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,679
through the environment that is

578
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
populated by others we're thinking

579
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,799
through other worlds

580
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,400
uh by the way i noticed that my camera

581
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,799
is very ours is not so you can

582
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
reload one one thought i'll give there

583
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
on the

584
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
uh the primacy of the organism from a

585
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,240
philosophy

586
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
of biology or natural selection

587
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,360
perspective is

588
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
it was seen that the organism or more

589
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
specifically to some

590
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,960
the genes of the organism are the only

591
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,559
thing that make it through the weissman

592
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
barrier the only thing to make it

593
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,559
into the next generation is the

594
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,039
information that encodes the organism

595
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,679
in one sense and so that says okay well

596
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,679
the organism is the unit of analysis and

597
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,960
things lower our

598
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
subgroups yes the beta cells in the in

599
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,559
the pancreas have a niche that's

600
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,240
surrounded by other types of cells and

601
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
yes the oocyte is supported by other

602
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,440
kinds of cells but

603
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
still the organism is the unit of

604
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,880
selection and so that gives

605
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,760
um some people a reason to think that

606
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,080
that

607
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
is the default and that anything bigger

608
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
than an organism is collective behavior

609
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
anything smaller than the organism is

610
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
molecular physiology or some different

611
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,799
field

612
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,039
but some of the implications of taking

613
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
this multi-scale proposal

614
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,760
seriously are that we still get the

615
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
richness of collective behavior

616
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
of lateral interactions within a level

617
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
as well as the hierarchical

618
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
layering and that combination of

619
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
hierarchical layering

620
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
with lateral interactions um goes by

621
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
various names including a heteroarchical

622
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,799
system from the social insect literature

623
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,200
and

624
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,559
when we start thinking about things like

625
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,480
the whole genome like the genome

626
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
encoding a developmental trajectory

627
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
in relationship with an environment and

628
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
a microbiome

629
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
pretty interesting stuff and it leads to

630
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,679
question what the unit of selection is

631
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
is it the organism is it the kin group

632
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
is it the kin group and the extended

633
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
phenotype and

634
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,240
one of the ways that we at least delay

635
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,960
the question

636
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,600
while deepening our understanding is by

637
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
just observing

638
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,799
and by modeling in the most integrative

639
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
framework that we can imagine

640
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
and then many of these other things fall

641
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,240
out many of the relationships between

642
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
higher and lower levels fall out but

643
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,600
just because there's a relationship

644
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
between a higher and a lower level

645
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
spatially

646
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
or laterally doesn't mean that one level

647
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
or the other is the one where things are

648
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,960
actually happening it's actually

649
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,919
happening across all the levels

650
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,760
okay oh yeah i mean i think that there's

651
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,559
a there's a perspective that's being

652
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
opened up here that really allows us to

653
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
move beyond

654
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,880
you know these kind of simplistic and

655
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
empirically inadequate models like homo

656
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
economicus

657
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
like this idea that what human beings

658
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
are really doing at the end of the day

659
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,279
is optimizing their individual expected

660
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
utility

661
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,360
uh when they're performing tasks i mean

662
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,840
it

663
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,720
it turns out that humans act in a way

664
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
that's

665
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,640
deeply social we events a fairness

666
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,600
psychology

667
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,799
not nash equilibrium uh type so there's

668
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,240
an interesting work in comparative

669
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
ethology that puts

670
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
uh chimpanzees against humans in a

671
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,520
variety of

672
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,440
economic tasks like the ultimatum game

673
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
and yeah it turns out that humans just

674
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,559
don't operate

675
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,400
according to the principles of classical

676
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
economics uh

677
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,799
we don't zero in on nash equilibria it

678
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,640
turns out that classical economics is

679
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,320
actually pretty good at predicting the

680
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,120
behavior of chimps though

681
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,559
and so uh it's probably the case that

682
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,640
humans in particular are subject to

683
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
forms of social

684
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,120
and cultural selection like forms of

685
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,520
like

686
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
let's let's use the word you know it's

687
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
group selection right

688
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,919
and you know this might have been spooky

689
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,440
and hard to explain a while back but

690
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
with the nested markov blanket formalism

691
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
i think we're finally getting to a point

692
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
where we can talk

693
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
about group selection in a way that's

694
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
not just slippery

695
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
uh and in a way that doesn't reduce

696
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
everything being selected

697
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,440
to as you're saying dan uh to the genes

698
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,159
yeah

699
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,640
um two quick points on that first with

700
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
the homo economicus

701
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,039
it debases us twice it says your

702
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
behavior is fundamentally economic

703
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
one strike and two you're not even that

704
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
good at it you make errors or you have

705
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:20,799
these

706
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
cognitive biases that lead you to make

707
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
false positive investments or false

708
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,960
negative

709
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,039
instead we could just take a step back

710
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,080
and observe

711
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
how we see people interacting in a

712
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
phylogenetic context just like you were

713
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,799
describing

714
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,440
and maybe that is how we are which is

715
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
that we are

716
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,760
pro-social and it's not an error

717
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,520
correction on an error correction

718
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
on a debasement it's actually we can

719
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,520
step into the richness of us as

720
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,400
social creatures rather than thinking of

721
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
sociality as being recovered

722
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
after we've already you know paid off

723
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
everybody um and then also

724
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
the question about group and kin

725
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
selection and all these different

726
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
levels of selection debate first off in

727
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,799
the

728
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
last several years through the work of

729
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,919
akasha and others

730
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
it has been described that some of these

731
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
mathematical equations

732
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,159
are actually formally identical so

733
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,919
there's an isomorphism and it's like you

734
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,400
can

735
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,080
model it different ways but you're gonna

736
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
get to some of the same consequences

737
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,200
um and we can think about the

738
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
affordances of a single cellular

739
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
bacteria let's say now a single cellular

740
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,240
bacteria's niche

741
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
may also involve metabolites from con

742
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,159
specifics and social interactions like

743
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
quorum sensing

744
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,279
um that's an example where the

745
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,600
replicator is still the single bacteria

746
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
however there's collective behavior like

747
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,799
quorum sensing and then

748
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
the major transitions in evolutionary

749
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,559
individuality

750
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,600
so like the prokaryote plus another uh

751
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
something to make a eukaryote eukaryotes

752
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,760
coming together to make multicellular

753
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,559
organisms and

754
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,320
multicellular insects becoming the

755
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
eusocial organisms

756
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
it's not based upon you know formica

757
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
economicus it's not the ants making an

758
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
economic trade-off

759
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
it's that when their affordances change

760
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
in the context of a niche

761
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
you end up seeing an evolutionary

762
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,679
trajectory that

763
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,320
favors obligate cooperation at that

764
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
scale

765
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,080
and precisely precisely it sidesteps a

766
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
lot of these

767
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,039
how would i feel if i were an aunt who

768
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,240
didn't get to reproduce

769
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,200
type questions which are really uh

770
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,000
sidetracks

771
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,799
relative to what is happening yeah and

772
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,880
you know i think uh

773
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
it's doing a lot of damage if we're

774
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
being real about it i mean you know the

775
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,360
these these economic models are not just

776
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,159
flawed

777
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
theoretically and empirically inadequate

778
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,000
they're also

779
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,360
driving investment um and you know the

780
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,919
the current state of the economy i think

781
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,159
which is you know despite what you might

782
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,480
hear from propaganda like not not so

783
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
great right now i mean

784
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,559
it's uh it it it i think in part it has

785
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,440
to do with the

786
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,080
flawed way in which we're understanding

787
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,559
you know

788
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,480
human economic behavior what we really

789
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,320
need to be doing is fostering a move

790
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
towards like you know

791
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,640
value or affordance-based economies yeah

792
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,360
or instead of how can we give everybody

793
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
enough

794
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
u.s coin so that they can buy food

795
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
another way to phrase that is

796
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,799
how could we reduce people's uncertainty

797
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,320
about their next meal

798
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
and maybe sometimes it looks this way

799
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
sometimes it looks that way

800
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,679
but if we were focused on reducing

801
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,440
physiological surprise

802
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,080
rather than as a proxy trying to

803
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
increase some value on a spreadsheet

804
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,880
thinking that people would then

805
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
um just acquire the foods it's an

806
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,080
interesting

807
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
idea if we pivoted from these

808
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
reward-based framings of political or

809
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,520
economic issues to

810
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,679
uncertainty based issues because it's

811
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,279
often what you hear people

812
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,360
needing help with is not knowing where

813
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
the next place they're going to sleep or

814
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,679
get their meal from

815
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,520
not i don't have enough to get a meal i

816
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
don't know where the meal is coming from

817
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,559
so it's actually interestingly an

818
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,960
uncertainty question even in that case

819
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,159
oh yeah absolutely here's our next slide

820
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,120
another quote from the paper is we

821
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,240
hypothesize

822
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,279
that the central mechanisms whereby

823
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
cultural affordances are acquired

824
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,559
especially conventional context

825
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,080
involving affordances

826
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
consists in looping our feedback

827
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,679
relations between shared intentionality

828
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,679
and shared attention in this light one

829
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,760
can view social norms and conventions as

830
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,080
devices to reduce mutual uncertainty

831
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
that is constantly with a free energy

832
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
framework as entropy minimizing devices

833
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,960
one must know what is in the minds of

834
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,159
others such as

835
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,080
what one would see and how one would

836
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,919
interpret another's action generally and

837
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,559
in context

838
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
in order to make a successful inference

839
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
both explicit

840
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
content involving or implicit

841
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
correlational inferences about other

842
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
agents in each simulation situation

843
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
sorry so the question here was

844
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
how do narratives reduce uncertainty how

845
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,159
does conversation

846
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,520
that's a great question um i mean you

847
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,240
know

848
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,880
you all did uh our paper on narratives a

849
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,840
few weeks ago so i'm sure you have some

850
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,960
elements so to answer that already but i

851
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,520
mean that

852
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,200
the fundamental idea i think uh is the

853
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,720
and also i don't want to take up too

854
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
much room if other people have

855
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
more interesting things to say please uh

856
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
by all means

857
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,039
you know jump in but i think you know

858
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
narratives do this in

859
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
two main ways uh following the two main

860
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,679
senses of narrative that we've outlined

861
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,799
right so

862
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,679
by a narrative you might understand uh

863
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,080
some kind of internal cognitive shama

864
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
right so like when you tell tell the

865
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
story of your life or whatever

866
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,360
and like from that point of view what

867
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,039
narratives allow is

868
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,240
for a kind of a novel

869
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,799
kind of useful uh re-representation of

870
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,559
lived events that you've already

871
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,360
undergone so it's a way of kind of

872
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
introducing new structure and meaning

873
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,159
into the flow of events that that have

874
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,559
happened to you

875
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,799
but by narrative you might also mean a

876
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,679
shared

877
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,679
story so literally a cultural artifact

878
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,840
that is produced through a storytelling

879
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
practice

880
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
and uh you know from from a niche

881
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,679
construction point of view

882
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,159
these are shared elements of a common

883
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
environment

884
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
that we interact with and effectively uh

885
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,279
internalize the structure of such that

886
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,080
we're we're then able to uh you know

887
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,919
redeploy the ideas

888
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,720
concepts values and so on that are

889
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,640
present

890
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,399
in the structure of that narrative to

891
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,480
structure our social life

892
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
if i had in a nutshell i think those are

893
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
the two main functions

894
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,960
yep um and please anyone on team com

895
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,720
raise your hand if you want to bring in

896
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,880
the paper uh the idea of that

897
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,000
narrative as almost being embodied in

898
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
our evolutionary priors reminds me of

899
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,200
the hero's journey

900
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,519
and the the narrative structure of the

901
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,039
hero's journey it's not about

902
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,080
the hero tying and untying their shoes

903
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,440
it's about a story arc which goes from a

904
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
to z and that does many things it

905
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,080
compresses the past

906
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
into a distilled representation so that

907
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
you don't need to remember

908
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
every single detail of the past but

909
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,799
rather you can

910
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,519
remember the action-relevant sections of

911
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,320
the past

912
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
like the bird told me something relevant

913
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,360
you don't need to remember how many

914
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,559
feathers were on the bird

915
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,320
it's enough to know that in a certain

916
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,399
space and time you had an interaction

917
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,559
where the bird told you go down this

918
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,440
path not that one and then the symbolism

919
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,080
as well and so words are symbols these

920
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
are things we'll return to as well

921
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
and so the narratives are like paths of

922
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
symbols whether strings of words

923
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,480
um or evocative uh patterns

924
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,200
yeah stephen

925
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,360
yeah and this also probably changes a

926
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,159
bit in terms of how indigenous cultures

927
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,679
work with story and legend

928
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,039
and animalism and

929
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,120
unknowns in the environment which they

930
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
were tuning to

931
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,679
and the way that we've kind of codified

932
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,600
our narratives these kind of grand

933
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,039
narratives which

934
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,720
rather than it being about the land

935
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
which indigenous culture tends to be

936
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,519
about the land

937
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,279
and timeless qualities that are

938
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,559
enfolding

939
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,159
you get this kind of you know you

940
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
mentioned about the past as an

941
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,600
entity that's in a timeline

942
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,679
where we have a sense of self in the

943
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,519
timeline which is actually

944
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,799
kind of a more modern way of thinking

945
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,000
about things so

946
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
in some ways we've actually designed an

947
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,559
understanding of how we fit into the

948
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,679
world

949
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,480
because our niche has changed in the way

950
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,880
that

951
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
you know you were talking about because

952
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,919
we've constructed

953
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,120
our own way of understanding what

954
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,919
our sort of human world is and attune to

955
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,039
that

956
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,919
now we're kind of we're even redefining

957
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,399
the way

958
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,559
we see our history and the way we see

959
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,799
narratives because narratives are these

960
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,200
broader temporal depths which can

961
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,320
stretch

962
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
and then stories have become kind of

963
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
commodified whereas in indigenous

964
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,760
culture

965
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,359
and story and land and us

966
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,440
are much more kind of in the present

967
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,239
in this kind of unfolded kind of cycle

968
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,560
that

969
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,719
nature provides rather than saying what

970
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
our calendars

971
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,599
or our watches provide yeah two

972
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,520
thoughts on that one is the distinction

973
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,679
between kronos and kairos

974
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,239
so the chronometer is the clock that's

975
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,679
tick tick tick tick tick

976
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
that's the regularities and the decimal

977
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,159
system and kairos means timeliness

978
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
and so it relates to dinner time versus

979
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,480
6 p.m those are very different things

980
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
one is an exact time independent of an

981
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,239
embodied experience

982
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,440
and the other one is actually the

983
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,239
experience independent of the clock time

984
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,800
so that's important and then also just

985
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,119
to highlight um the pragmatism

986
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,440
of taking an action-oriented approach or

987
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,640
the active inference approach to

988
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,200
thinking about our modern life

989
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,599
as team com we often find it helpful

990
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,680
when beginning and closing a meeting

991
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,800
like bookends

992
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,000
to almost have narrative review just

993
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
restating syntactically here's who's

994
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,839
here

995
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,000
here's what we intend to get out of this

996
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,040
interaction or

997
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,359
here are the goals of the meeting in

998
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,320
previous

999
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
frameworks like getting things done is

1000
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
technically an action-oriented framework

1001
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
but not in the inactive embodied sense

1002
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,560
it's sort of in a productivity

1003
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,200
homo economicus framework and so you get

1004
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
convergent evolution

1005
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,480
of sometimes the recommendations like

1006
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,839
make a to-do list or

1007
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,440
restate the goals at the beginning of

1008
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,520
the meeting but rather than thinking

1009
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,480
about these

1010
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,119
as simply tasks to be achieved it

1011
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,320
actually helps us

1012
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,680
realign at an increasingly fine scale

1013
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,400
with the work that needs to be done and

1014
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
that is a full stack

1015
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,960
alignment from the syntactic level the

1016
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
details and the nitty gritty of the work

1017
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
that does need to get done

1018
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
up through the narrative where are we at

1019
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,640
this moment and what alphas does this

1020
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
project relate to that's from the

1021
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,599
systems engineering

1022
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,599
framework all the way up to the highest

1023
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
level which is

1024
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
what is our group doing what is our

1025
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,320
company doing what problems are we

1026
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,520
trying to solve

1027
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,480
and these ground floor or pet house

1028
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
level questions depending on how you

1029
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,640
think about it

1030
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,440
are foundational and we return again and

1031
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,119
again to these questions about what our

1032
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,240
purpose is

1033
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,079
and that's man's search for meaning

1034
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,760
that's the whole task

1035
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,560
and that doesn't really end so by

1036
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,200
framing the problem not just as a set of

1037
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
uh popping in tasks to the stack and

1038
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
then finishing them

1039
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
we can think about this as this ongoing

1040
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
process of realignment

1041
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,560
of the details of our sensory states to

1042
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,520
our desired

1043
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
regularities that we want to see in the

1044
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,640
world

1045
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,320
any other thoughts on this slide

1046
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
cool all right so we are gonna have a

1047
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,160
few

1048
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
embodied affordance questions so here's

1049
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,680
a quote from the paper

1050
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
sports science provides an illustration

1051
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
of this tendency towards optimal grip

1052
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,680
studies of the dynamic interplay between

1053
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,200
a boxer's stance and position

1054
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
and the action possibilities available

1055
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
to them as a function of stance and

1056
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,520
position

1057
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
have shown that punching bags afford

1058
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
different kinds of strikes to boxers as

1059
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
a function of the distance between

1060
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
boxer and punching bag boxers tend to

1061
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
move their bodies to an

1062
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,440
optimal distance from the punching bag

1063
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,119
specifically one that affords the

1064
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,079
greatest variety

1065
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,079
of strikes so not the most powerful not

1066
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,200
the most rewarding

1067
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,760
not the most um unexpected to the other

1068
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,359
person in a theory of mind but actually

1069
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
the greatest variety from an embodied

1070
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
perspective of the actor

1071
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
this is a case of moving towards optimal

1072
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,720
grip so

1073
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
it's beyond the grasping now we're

1074
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
talking about stance

1075
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,079
when observing a painting we also move

1076
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,760
our bodies and our gazes in a way that

1077
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,599
maximizes our grip on the scene or

1078
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,800
details observed

1079
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,720
we might call such dynamic adaptive

1080
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
engagement with a field of affordances

1081
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
in rolling cycles of action perception

1082
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,119
skilled intentionality so the question

1083
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,000
here is

1084
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
what is being optimized by the body what

1085
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,599
do

1086
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,400
bodies do

1087
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
it's a good question there's probably a

1088
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
couple of answers

1089
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,680
and we can maybe go reveal half of the

1090
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,720
hint which is

1091
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
how do predictions play into this

1092
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
optimization

1093
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,599
so what is the body optimizing um

1094
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,200
doesn't need to be the end-all be-all

1095
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
answer but what is something the body

1096
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,680
optimizes and then

1097
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,359
how do predictions play into this

1098
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,280
optimization

1099
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,240
well i mean a lot of my own work has

1100
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,960
been about

1101
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
since writing this paper has been about

1102
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
figuring out exactly what this means

1103
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,960
uh but you know if if the free energy

1104
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,079
principle

1105
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,359
holds then it's not just brains that are

1106
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,280
doing this free energy minimization

1107
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
business

1108
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,599
it's really every level of biological

1109
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,640
self-organization

1110
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,280
and there it really just means the same

1111
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
thing across all levels which means that

1112
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,920
you know

1113
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
you have a desired distribution over

1114
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,520
your data

1115
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,680
and you know actions

1116
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,079
acting on the environment is generated

1117
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,520
such that

1118
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,200
this preferred data distribution is

1119
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
brought about what changes

1120
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,079
at each scale is what the relevant data

1121
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,880
is what the relevant set points are and

1122
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,960
what the mechanisms are that bring about

1123
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
the preferred data distribution right so

1124
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,320
uh you know from a cellular point of

1125
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
view

1126
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,000
uh you know the markov blanket of a cell

1127
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,040
is effectively

1128
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,880
its membrane uh where the sensory states

1129
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,200
are

1130
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,520
all the receptor surfaces of the cell

1131
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
and the active

1132
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,280
states are like the cytoskeleton and

1133
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,160
other

1134
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
mechanisms that allow the cell to move

1135
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,599
about and to

1136
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,520
effectively generate the patterns of

1137
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,400
data that it expects to encounter

1138
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
but this very same story can be told at

1139
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
basically every level of like i was

1140
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,920
saying a biological self-organization

1141
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
where like from a

1142
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
from an interoceptive point of view uh

1143
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,320
what the body is doing is trying to keep

1144
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,720
some of its core homeostatic variables

1145
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,599
within

1146
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
uh viable ranges right so uh you know

1147
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,200
core body temperature might be

1148
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,839
maintained using such a mechanism where

1149
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,240
when you register a deviation from 36

1150
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,359
and a half degrees

1151
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,040
you know you might have like a kind of

1152
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,000
low level uh autonomic kind of reaction

1153
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
you know you'll start shivering

1154
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,040
and you'll get goosebumps and so on uh

1155
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,839
but you know for uh animals like

1156
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,880
ourselves that have

1157
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,720
repertoires of cultural behavior well

1158
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,160
you might put on a parka

1159
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
you might turn your air conditioning on

1160
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
there are a bunch of other solutions

1161
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
to the same issue and i mean i think

1162
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,839
this is really the strength of the free

1163
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,720
energy principle

1164
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
i alluded to this last week uh i i

1165
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,839
at the time of writing this i sort of

1166
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,319
had an idea how this would work but

1167
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,240
it took the following four years of my

1168
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,319
life to really figure out what

1169
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
what that entailed you know along with

1170
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,240
our our collaborators

1171
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,599
uh carl fristen and everyone else

1172
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,520
if i can add one point on this into how

1173
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,720
the predictions play into the

1174
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,680
optimization

1175
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,079
so there's the classical control theory

1176
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,200
thermostat

1177
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
temperature drops and then the body can

1178
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,400
engage in the

1179
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,480
interoceptive affordances like

1180
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
uncoupling in the mitochondria

1181
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,359
or shivering or the behavioral and the

1182
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,280
uh cultural affordances like wearing a

1183
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,839
jacket

1184
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,760
but how about if you were planning a

1185
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,520
trip to somewhere that was cold

1186
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
so there's nothing in your local

1187
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,200
environment that's telling you that your

1188
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,640
temperature is dropping in fact you

1189
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,280
could be in

1190
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
arizona sweating but you're packing for

1191
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
somewhere that's cold

1192
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,520
and so traditional theories of semiotics

1193
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
might be challenged by that they could

1194
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
say well you saw um

1195
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,400
the cold city and you looked at the

1196
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,839
website and so you made some sort of

1197
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,480
connection

1198
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,599
and you keep on doing this back

1199
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,680
propagation of symbols which

1200
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,560
is a valid account but also we can think

1201
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
about what the body's doing

1202
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,960
is optimizing its thermal range it's

1203
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,200
minimizing surprise about excursions

1204
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,760
from its

1205
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,640
thermal range that's tolerable and then

1206
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,280
it's

1207
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,000
acting based upon its prediction and so

1208
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
similarly

1209
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,119
there's substances or states where your

1210
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,640
body's prediction

1211
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,160
it's now cast prediction or its future

1212
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
prediction can be wrong

1213
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,280
and so you can have people who are

1214
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
shivering even though their body

1215
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,079
temperature is high in the case of the

1216
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:16,640
flu

1217
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
or something like that so it's really

1218
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,319
the interaction of the

1219
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,400
prediction and the affordances not

1220
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,480
necessarily the instantaneous however

1221
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,440
the instantaneous

1222
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,839
is often the most at hand um sasha

1223
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,839
um this is quite funny but this metaphor

1224
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,359
reminded me of um

1225
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
just kind of the stereotypical like when

1226
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,720
you go out your mother tells you to

1227
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
bring a jacket

1228
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,480
and that's because like the older

1229
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
caretaker role thinks farther ahead

1230
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,520
into future states and the

1231
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,960
younger child role

1232
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,599
um they're just thinking about right now

1233
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,800
or where they're going

1234
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,200
and they're not thinking to this

1235
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
possible future state

1236
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,760
they're not planning for that um

1237
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,000
possibility so i just thought that was a

1238
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,800
a nice

1239
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,319
parallel to this whole uh jacket

1240
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,160
thermoregulation um

1241
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,119
how far ahead we're willing to plan to

1242
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:19,839
reduce

1243
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,640
um variability or uncertainty in our

1244
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,520
environment

1245
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,280
and differences potentially in risk

1246
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,560
tolerance too

1247
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
even say i i know it's going to be cold

1248
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,640
mom i just don't want to risk losing my

1249
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,599
jacket or i

1250
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,119
want to be cold or something that or i

1251
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,720
don't want to listen to you because

1252
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,040
whatever oh sasha i think you're putting

1253
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,160
your your finger on

1254
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,599
precisely like the core kind of

1255
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,640
political economic issue that we're

1256
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,359
dealing with

1257
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,400
as a species right now which is that the

1258
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,640
problems that we're dealing with

1259
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,000
are occurring at a scale that

1260
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,440
that is more or less invisible uh

1261
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,160
to the generative models that we've

1262
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,280
evolved

1263
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,640
uh in our heads effectively right so uh

1264
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,280
you know climate uh climate change

1265
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,800
global warming

1266
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,359
uh these are processes that unfold over

1267
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
decades

1268
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,839
and uh that require large scale

1269
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,280
responses uh you know probably

1270
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,599
to address this you know in in any way

1271
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,920
decently like a kind of multinational

1272
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
coordinated response

1273
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,839
uh but our brains are meant to deal with

1274
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,560
phenomena spanning from a few seconds

1275
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,680
to you know maybe a year

1276
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
in in more traditional societies when

1277
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,280
you're like dealing with the season

1278
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,839
cycle

1279
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,960
and everything uh and so there's a huge

1280
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,160
gap there

1281
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,400
and you know i think the the disconnect

1282
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,079
between the kind of scientific

1283
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,040
consensus and uh you know at least in

1284
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,520
the us the kind of lay consensus

1285
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
on say climate change has to do with the

1286
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,440
difference in temporal depth

1287
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,200
of the models that we're looking at so

1288
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,440
as scientists we we deal with these like

1289
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,079
you know

1290
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,160
models that in in the case of like

1291
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,920
astrophysics allows us to

1292
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,000
increase by like you know orders and

1293
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,599
orders of magnitude for

1294
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,240
like the the scope of our predictions

1295
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,960
and uh

1296
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
and so on but then there's this gap

1297
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,280
you know uh between our our intuitive

1298
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,359
understanding of the world and physics

1299
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,359
and this also connects back to the world

1300
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,560
that we live in

1301
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,359
you know uh what kind of world we share

1302
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,839
ultimately

1303
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,160
um yeah so all of that stuff

1304
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,560
yeah yes nice um stephen

1305
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,800
yeah i think i agree with what's being

1306
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,040
said and we've got into this

1307
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
world at the moment where we we're very

1308
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,319
focused on what we want

1309
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,599
and how we can achieve that but

1310
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,440
in our bodies might be when we're

1311
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
putting on the coat or something we're

1312
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,720
meeting our needs

1313
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,760
as an organism so that the heat

1314
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,560
and in complex adaptive systems for

1315
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
development they're looking at like

1316
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,200
need want and love to have happen

1317
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
and like the want is what we might you

1318
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,800
know and

1319
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,839
we tend to focus on this instrumental

1320
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,359
want but that can change

1321
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,640
within like this construct but

1322
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,560
our bodies we tune into this kind of

1323
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,760
deeper feeling

1324
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
of what we need like we can infer that

1325
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,680
and connect to that

1326
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,119
and i think that is um

1327
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,119
that's partly what active inference sort

1328
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,800
of helps us go back to

1329
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,480
okay when we're starting to sit into

1330
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,839
that because indigenous cultures look at

1331
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,319
that thing of seven generations

1332
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,400
and it's not like they plan for seven

1333
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
generations but they

1334
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,200
sense what's needed so they're kind of

1335
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,560
working at that kind of you know organic

1336
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,359
level

1337
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,319
one one way also that the temporality

1338
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,079
becomes embodied in our language in

1339
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,280
active through language is

1340
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,359
which words don't have plurals in

1341
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,960
english now this isn't like a hard and

1342
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,640
fast rule but oil

1343
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,839
fish sheep there's a lot of words where

1344
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:04,560
it's just like

1345
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,880
it's air it's just there's no airs how

1346
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
many errors are here it's just air is

1347
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,280
around us

1348
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,680
so implicitly one shouldn't have to

1349
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,520
worry about depleting it right

1350
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,200
well wrong because of course you can

1351
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,119
overfish and so

1352
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,240
it really bridges us to asking about

1353
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,359
how could we construct our actions today

1354
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,520
so that it influences the way that we

1355
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
want the future to be

1356
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,280
just to complete this slide the last

1357
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,200
question is beyond physical grip

1358
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,599
where does this idea of optimal grip

1359
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,319
apply

1360
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,280
and a really nice visualization was from

1361
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,359
yelle broomberg's and eric wrightville's

1362
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,760
paper on self-organization free energy

1363
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,640
minimization

1364
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,160
and optimal grip on a field of

1365
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,079
affordances which was cited

1366
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,760
in ramstead's paper and so here we see

1367
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,000
three representations of fields of

1368
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,839
affordances so these are like blocks

1369
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,359
that you could pick up they're blocks

1370
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,319
that you could sit on

1371
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,760
maybe blocks that you could carve a

1372
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,680
sculpture out of there are things that

1373
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,400
you can do

1374
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,240
stuff with and depending on the

1375
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,480
affordance it's gonna

1376
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,119
be a different one and the normal on the

1377
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,319
top in a

1378
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,400
we see that there's multiple different

1379
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,319
kinds of affordances of different types

1380
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,680
there's a bunch of yellow ones a bunch

1381
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,520
of red ones and a bunch of blue ones

1382
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,040
and maybe they have differential

1383
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,440
salience or they're adequate for

1384
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,359
different uses like a taller or a

1385
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:21,839
shorter

1386
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,520
person then in b and c we see two

1387
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
sort of hyperbolic and simplified but

1388
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,720
still didactic

1389
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,520
representations of alternate states so

1390
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,319
in b

1391
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,880
which is depression all of the field of

1392
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,000
affordances

1393
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,040
look less interesting they all look

1394
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,319
relatively drab and uh sort of not

1395
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,839
uh fun and in ocd we see that there's a

1396
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,400
massive highlighting of one of these

1397
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,000
affordances at almost

1398
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,839
the expense of completely blocking the

1399
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,359
perception of all of these other

1400
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,319
affordances

1401
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,960
and so i find this to be a really

1402
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,599
helpful

1403
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,640
framework because it helps highlight the

1404
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,160
commonalities between

1405
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,839
for example different people who are in

1406
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,200
a depressed state or different

1407
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,559
representations of

1408
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,240
obsession on different topics it could

1409
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,599
be rumination

1410
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,319
in thought it could be a specific motor

1411
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,040
behavior

1412
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,200
but when we think about it like this we

1413
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,079
can actually

1414
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,319
go from this representation backwards

1415
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,440
and say okay well

1416
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,680
could we change our perspective so that

1417
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,839
yes the red square is still really big

1418
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,400
but also we can see at least just for

1419
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,040
now just

1420
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,760
see these other affordances or could we

1421
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
make one of those gray boxes a little

1422
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,359
bit more exciting

1423
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,200
so i i just like this as a

1424
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,559
representation and

1425
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,559
it shows that this grip concept and the

1426
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,160
affordance idea

1427
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,000
is really transferable to different

1428
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
areas springberg

1429
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,680
eric grievel julian kaverstein don't

1430
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,359
necessarily get enough credit for this

1431
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,119
whole skilled intentionality framework

1432
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,960
that they've developed

1433
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,240
uh you know i i think it's it's some of

1434
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,920
the connective tissue that really

1435
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,359
allowed us to

1436
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,480
build the cultural affordances framework

1437
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,480
i really really like the way that they

1438
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,079
connect

1439
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,040
the kind of inactive emphasis on you

1440
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,440
know action orientation

1441
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,680
and embodied kind of coping with an

1442
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,200
environment

1443
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,880
with the ecological psychology

1444
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,319
literature

1445
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,440
on affordances and so on i mean uh we

1446
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,200
were discussing this last week

1447
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,599
their use of affordance is also not i

1448
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,240
think

1449
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,319
consonant with the kind of classical

1450
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,800
gibsonian sense of affordance

1451
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,760
uh where you know and i i mean the

1452
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,359
common sense and

1453
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,559
use of affordance i think in in academia

1454
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,119
at least

1455
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,520
also doesn't really resonate with what

1456
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,480
gibson meant

1457
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,319
recall that what gibson meant really was

1458
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,160
that uh all the

1459
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,240
information that an organism needs to

1460
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,839
interact with its environment

1461
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,000
is already available in its sensory

1462
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,440
array

1463
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,319
as it moves through its environment such

1464
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,599
that

1465
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,160
you know an internal reconstruction of

1466
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,520
the environment

1467
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,359
wasn't all that necessary because you

1468
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,640
could just directly

1469
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,160
interact with the environment so a lot

1470
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,839
of these commitments are kind of falling

1471
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:08,079
out

1472
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,760
especially like in our our use of the

1473
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
of the construct in the free energy

1474
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,880
principle framework like

1475
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,960
we're explicitly reintroducing notions

1476
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,079
like affordance

1477
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,520
sorry like uh inference uh you know like

1478
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,920
reconstructing the set of causes that

1479
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,559
led to

1480
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,599
the the sensory stimulation uh

1481
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,920
but i think uh you know some of the

1482
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,119
people who make

1483
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,440
uh the the concept palatable and usable

1484
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,000
in things

1485
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
like uh sports sciences and so on are

1486
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,640
these people pushing the skill

1487
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,839
intentionality

1488
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,160
framework like it's a it's a very useful

1489
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,960
framework

1490
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
especially i don't know like uh stephen

1491
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,319
i'd be curious to hear what you think

1492
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,760
about this

1493
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,359
as someone who's coming more at this

1494
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,040
from the practice and

1495
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,359
i think the concepts there are more

1496
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,480
readily

1497
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,280
usable than some of the more like formal

1498
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,559
stuff coming from

1499
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,800
active inference and so on and yet it's

1500
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,000
all kind of part of the same

1501
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,440
conceptual framework

1502
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,839
yeah i i agree i mean this is where it

1503
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,359
gets complex because you've got

1504
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,000
quite a radical form of affordances

1505
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,359
being thought of and

1506
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,440
intentionality and you've got obviously

1507
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,880
the active inference

1508
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,040
complexity but they're like they talk

1509
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,240
about social

1510
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,000
practice theory in um as as quite a

1511
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,599
in environmental science work now a lot

1512
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,599
so they're trying to look at things

1513
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,800
through

1514
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,359
what's the social practices and the

1515
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,640
social norms that

1516
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,720
kind of align people i think it's the

1517
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,079
same

1518
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,520
kind of thing that you're talking about

1519
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,200
here it gives

1520
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,559
it gives an actual plausible mechanism

1521
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,200
so it doesn't jump from like this is

1522
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,480
what's happening in my body

1523
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,760
and then suddenly there's some

1524
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,079
theoretical framework which is

1525
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,960
somehow completely separate it's like

1526
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,960
okay it makes sense that i'm

1527
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,880
i'm enacting putting my coat on i've

1528
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,640
been acting looking at this

1529
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,640
painting and trying to understand it i'm

1530
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,040
now enacting looking at this painting

1531
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,440
like i used to work in them in graphic

1532
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,640
reproduction so when you look

1533
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,160
you know you're not looking at the

1534
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,520
painting anymore you're looking for the

1535
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,440
colors in it or is it going to reproduce

1536
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,720
or i'm going to zoom in on it with

1537
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,400
photoshop so it's like

1538
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,240
the practice of engaging with the

1539
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
environment and then like what's that

1540
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,240
fitted into if it's going to go into a

1541
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,640
publication so what's the intentionality

1542
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,880
what's the kind of scales

1543
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,640
of practices um

1544
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,800
and i think that i think what you're

1545
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,319
saying it makes sense i don't know if

1546
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,280
the two

1547
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,079
have quite managed to join up yet to

1548
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,640
make it fully practice

1549
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,839
ready because to try and explain it but

1550
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,760
i think what maybe that's where it just

1551
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,880
has to be used

1552
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,680
in practical applications in like an

1553
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,040
activity

1554
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,359
and maybe the people doing the activity

1555
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,880
don't need to know all the stuff that's

1556
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,079
going on behind the

1557
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,520
under the hood if that makes sense um so

1558
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,960
yep nice well i want to come to some of

1559
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,680
the other

1560
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,400
ideas in our other sections so this is

1561
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:10,880
the

1562
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,000
section on ontologies and culture so

1563
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,359
here are two

1564
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,359
nice representations one of people

1565
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,960
working together all around the world

1566
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,760
and the other one

1567
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,720
of the skeleton that we all know and

1568
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,559
love of active inference

1569
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,760
the question is how do ontologies relate

1570
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,800
to culture

1571
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,760
and then if a person wanted to address

1572
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,599
that question with a raised hand or the

1573
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,559
second question

1574
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,200
is what kinds of tools are needed to

1575
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,760
work

1576
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,440
with ontologies and narratives

1577
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,720
so i'll start with one of language as an

1578
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,040
ontology scheme for the regularities and

1579
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,799
the objects that are around us

1580
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,119
so it's one of the cliches that x

1581
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:53,839
culture has

1582
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,640
y words for z concept you know oh this

1583
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,799
culture has 22 ways to describe this

1584
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,480
and of course you can always add

1585
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,559
adjectives to describe a variety of

1586
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,920
different kinds of

1587
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,640
snow or sand or whatever it is but it

1588
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,280
becomes

1589
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,920
deeper through time and there becomes

1590
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,000
specialized words that really capture

1591
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,880
and can finesse as an as a handleable as

1592
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,040
a grippable concept different types of

1593
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,720
sand snow whatever it happens to be

1594
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,079
trees and then

1595
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,559
can then be built into larger systems or

1596
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,599
sentences

1597
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,960
maxwell um

1598
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,119
yeah so i mean i i think what you just

1599
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,400
said was very interesting

1600
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,079
um i just want to clarify a bit what we

1601
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,040
meant by

1602
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,319
uh ontologies in this context um so

1603
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,520
i mean we're drawing on uh the

1604
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,960
ontological turn material uh that's

1605
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,760
coming out of

1606
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,160
anthropology in large part uh apologies

1607
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,040
to steven

1608
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,799
uh some of this material is delusion uh

1609
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,280
i mean you know i i also tend to share

1610
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,200
your your reservations about

1611
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,760
uh some of the uh stuff coming out of

1612
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,160
delos and stuff but

1613
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,359
uh so the ontological turn fundamentally

1614
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,880
is saying something like well

1615
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,200
what we should be doing is talking about

1616
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,839
the worlds in which people inhabit

1617
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,839
in the way that they inhabit it right

1618
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,240
rather than just saying what we have

1619
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,480
as scientists as knowledge and what

1620
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,200
other people have is mere belief

1621
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,880
uh what we should be doing is talking

1622
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,640
about like the really the worlds in

1623
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,240
which people live

1624
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,480
and and the ontologies or like the

1625
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,599
categories of

1626
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,160
types of being that people are kind of

1627
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,520
bringing on board

1628
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,799
um so you know we we don't

1629
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,400
i think we're at odds with some of the

1630
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,000
people in the um

1631
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,160
the ontological term because we take a

1632
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,000
meta-bayesian approach to this which is

1633
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,960
to say well we all

1634
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,359
operate with beliefs the scientific

1635
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,520
worldview is also a set of beliefs that

1636
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,680
comes with its own ontology and whatever

1637
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,680
so as long as it's an even playing field

1638
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,520
and there's no like kind of

1639
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,559
disparity uh between you know the the

1640
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,520
respect with

1641
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,119
to that we're according to different

1642
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,960
kinds of knowledges

1643
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,720
then you know we're sort of all

1644
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,799
operating with our ontologies

1645
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,680
and in the context here in this paper

1646
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,599
what we mean more specifically

1647
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,119
is things like uh like ontologies

1648
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,640
of persons right like so uh

1649
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,359
for those of us in the american and

1650
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,760
particularly north american context you

1651
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,319
know racism and colorism our major

1652
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,440
issues

1653
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,119
and you know it just is the case that

1654
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,040
young children even even children

1655
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,319
that hail from minority groups

1656
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,799
internalize

1657
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,079
the categories of personhood uh of the

1658
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:42,960
dominant

1659
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,280
uh political group right so you know the

1660
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,400
the well-known

1661
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,799
you know uh experiments on children

1662
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,920
suggesting that

1663
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,599
you know children from racialized

1664
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,079
communities tend to prefer uh

1665
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,319
dolls for example that look like white

1666
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,480
people or whatever or dolls that

1667
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,559
uh are consonant with their own kind of

1668
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,839
ethnic

1669
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,960
uh you know outward appearance

1670
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,760
uh and so the yeah what what we're

1671
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,119
talking about then is like

1672
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,480
the categories of p you know uh

1673
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,720
different kinds of people uh different

1674
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,000
kinds of places

1675
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,480
uh all of these kind of concepts and

1676
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,319
norms and frameworks that

1677
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,040
so all this is an ontology it's it's a

1678
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,119
way of cutting up your sensory stream

1679
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,200
effectively of parsing your

1680
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,559
phenomenology

1681
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,000
and what we're suggesting is that this

1682
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,480
is acquired mainly through immersive

1683
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,880
participation in practices

1684
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,520
so you don't have to be explicitly told

1685
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,319
for example

1686
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,680
the first time you go to a fancy

1687
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
restaurant not to jump up and down

1688
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,359
on the the tables

1689
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,520
humans are exquisitely sensitive to

1690
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,640
context

1691
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,040
and we're able to just dynamically

1692
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,079
extract

1693
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,720
the norms of the situation well at least

1694
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,280
the

1695
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,280
most neurotypical humans are able to do

1696
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,040
this on the fly

1697
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,200
without instruction and so this is where

1698
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,040
the ontology stuff at least comes in in

1699
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,960
this paper

1700
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,839
yeah alejandra

1701
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,440
yeah um well actually i was

1702
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,640
thinking about this um idea about the

1703
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,160
landscape affordances

1704
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,440
and the shared attention

1705
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,720
and how this shared attention is

1706
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,160
determining which expectations

1707
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,760
will be encoded in in this hierarchical

1708
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,440
predictive uh

1709
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,119
processing so i was wondering

1710
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,440
and also in terms of these scientologies

1711
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,559
related to

1712
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,720
culture um about social networks

1713
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,760
um it's kind of weird but yeah this is

1714
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,000
idiot it's very um

1715
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,200
like um importantly in my mind how these

1716
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,040
um new ways of interacting

1717
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,319
um are changing it's

1718
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,480
it's a kind of a massive joint attention

1719
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,960
uh i i don't know how to to to say it

1720
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,839
but yeah

1721
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,640
yeah like a massive joint attention a

1722
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,440
kind of

1723
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,040
extended culture that is manipulating us

1724
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,400
um to what to attend so

1725
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,640
um in in in some ways is changing um

1726
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,000
what we believe that is relevant

1727
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,319
and um manipulating us um

1728
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,119
our attention and what to expect but in

1729
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,720
a massive

1730
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,480
way um and i think but we are not

1731
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,680
conscious about this um um the

1732
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,880
the effect that is having on

1733
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,920
on our um beliefs and

1734
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,280
as as you were saying maxwell uh this

1735
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,400
um racism and social

1736
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,480
preferences i think that um

1737
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,160
i don't i don't know if i'm explaining

1738
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,599
myself but this this

1739
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,520
massive joint attention um

1740
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,359
is is kind of affecting our our grip

1741
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,640
the way we grip with society

1742
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,440
in um unexpected ways i don't know yeah

1743
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,119
that makes total sense to me

1744
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,440
uh i really think that this is like a

1745
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,640
really key issue

1746
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,640
uh i mean you know the it's unfortunate

1747
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,119
but

1748
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,520
uh you know prejudicial behavior and

1749
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,359
like hate crimes have been on the rise

1750
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,559
steadily since

1751
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,799
you know the trump administration took

1752
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,000
power

1753
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,280
and uh i mean i think it speaks to the

1754
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,359
the power of uh you know

1755
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,200
the power of the of the media

1756
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,599
effectively and of shared images and

1757
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,200
shared narratives

1758
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,480
you know um i mean personally i think a

1759
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,319
lot of the issue comes from the fact

1760
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,040
that

1761
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,319
uh you know older generations uh

1762
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,119
weren't taught to be information skeptic

1763
01:01:59,119 --> 01:01:59,839
right

1764
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,799
uh so i mean you know uh growing up now

1765
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,799
as a 30-something when i was a kid and

1766
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,720
internet was like starting out

1767
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,000
you know what you learned was don't

1768
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,359
trust everything you read on the

1769
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,240
internet

1770
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,720
so there's the i think one of the the

1771
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,280
issues

1772
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,480
is that uh

1773
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,640
communities form around different types

1774
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,760
of epistemic

1775
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,359
standards effectively um

1776
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,559
and i mean if you sort of look at the

1777
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,359
split

1778
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,079
the cultural split the the increasingly

1779
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,280
deepening

1780
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,920
kind of cultural split uh between you

1781
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,839
know more conservative and more

1782
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,440
uh liberal uh populations in the u.s

1783
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,839
for example uh i think what you see is

1784
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,599
really a split in

1785
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,960
modes of adequate justification

1786
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,559
um you know so it's it's stunning to me

1787
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:51,920
how the same kind of fact

1788
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,119
base can lead to completely opposite

1789
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:58,480
interpretations uh in this kind of

1790
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,119
context

1791
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,599
but unfortunately you know the uh

1792
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,640
the fact that you know uh you have like

1793
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,359
these

1794
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,559
very hateful groups that now spread uh

1795
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,839
messages uh you know on a medium

1796
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,720
that then is shared i mean it really

1797
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,640
takes the

1798
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,720
it takes the uh joseph henrik uh puts

1799
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,400
this well uh in in his great book the

1800
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,440
the secret of our success he says uh

1801
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,559
essentially the same things that make us

1802
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,880
capable of incredible feats of

1803
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,319
coordination

1804
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,480
you know and that have allowed us to you

1805
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,960
know like build large-scale cities and

1806
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,799
develop modern medicine

1807
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,359
uh the same capacity for intense

1808
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,480
cooperation

1809
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,880
is also what makes us docile and what

1810
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,680
makes us crave totalitarian rulers

1811
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,240
uh we we just like to be very nice and

1812
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:54,960
agreeable

1813
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,680
you know and and if if everyone kind of

1814
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,599
decides that some group is going to be

1815
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:00,960
the scapegoat

1816
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,200
well you know there's a tendency to go

1817
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,640
along with that

1818
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,440
and you know if we're if our hypothesis

1819
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,400
is correct and

1820
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,200
there's also a tendency to just acquire

1821
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,240
unthinkingly

1822
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,119
download the kind of information that's

1823
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,760
presented to us in immersive contexts

1824
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,440
then it's not surprising that you know

1825
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,720
if these messages are spreading online

1826
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,799
you know in very highly immersive kind

1827
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,039
of tunnel vision things like youtube

1828
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,200
channels that's just like re-link

1829
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,799
similar content i mean

1830
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,119
like yeah i don't know if this is an

1831
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,880
entirely coherent message but i do

1832
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,079
deeply resonate with what you were

1833
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,920
saying alejandra i think

1834
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,480
this is uh this is a huge set of issues

1835
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,160
that we need to address

1836
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,240
and it a lot of my own research for the

1837
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,599
next several years is going to be

1838
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,760
directed in precisely

1839
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,799
this direction uh like countering

1840
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,559
understanding and countering the spread

1841
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,000
of these narratives and like

1842
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,640
just modeling social dynamics using

1843
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,520
these tools

1844
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,200
more broadly yeah exactly as well

1845
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,880
sorry then just to add something um

1846
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,400
in terms of like your personal

1847
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,839
narrative your own story um

1848
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,200
how how is affected um

1849
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,079
i i can see it in in adolescence or in

1850
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,119
child's

1851
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,960
they are just expecting alike and that's

1852
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,799
meaning so meaningful to to um

1853
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,520
minimizing prediction error about

1854
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,920
yourself so uh

1855
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,799
yeah it's like you have like thousands

1856
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:35,039
and

1857
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,520
or hundreds of people just paying

1858
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,799
attention

1859
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,920
about your picture and and if you

1860
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,000
receive 10 likes or 100 likes

1861
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,359
um what this like

1862
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,400
um the way that the self

1863
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,240
is gripping to to this um

1864
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,520
that's an interesting point there's a

1865
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,680
weird kind of self-evidencing i guess

1866
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,720
yeah it's very sad but i guess that it's

1867
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,400
really tragic when you think about it

1868
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,319
right we off sourced we off sourced our

1869
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,400
sovereignty of attention to algorithms

1870
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,039
and those are driven by exploit and in

1871
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,880
our sense of self-worth

1872
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,760
right so from an active inference point

1873
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,319
of view

1874
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,880
likes and retweets and shares and

1875
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,839
whatever

1876
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,160
are evidence for your existence right

1877
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,400
for for a model of you

1878
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,520
having worth in a social environment

1879
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,839
uh that's actually i think worth at

1880
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,440
least the paper if you want to write

1881
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,799
that up alejandra

1882
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,520
like send me a dm and we'll write that

1883
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,480
up as a paper

1884
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,440
it sounds it's a great idea um sasha

1885
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,520
uh yeah i just wanted to add on to that

1886
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,200
um

1887
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,599
a comment about uh don't trust the

1888
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,319
internet

1889
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,359
um and i i really like the phrase that

1890
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:51,920
you used

1891
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,480
alejandra uh the massive joint attention

1892
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,559
um and then it seems like social media

1893
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,440
um is kind of able to bypass that filter

1894
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:03,680
of

1895
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,799
don't trust the internet but these are

1896
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:07,680
my friends

1897
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,240
this isn't the internet these um the

1898
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,920
social network somehow

1899
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,680
is able to pass through that filter that

1900
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,640
this is a group of people that we trust

1901
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,240
that we feel that we trust

1902
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,799
more than the internet as this um

1903
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:23,760
greater entity

1904
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,920
well they don't call it anti-social

1905
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
media they don't call it physical

1906
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,599
distancing they say social distance

1907
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,079
these words really matter as far as

1908
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,440
slipping in the back door

1909
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,880
semantically with what um is

1910
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,000
uh being communicated in the end

1911
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,280
so yes um to pick up on what sasha was

1912
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,559
saying i think uh

1913
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,880
the internet's epistemic status is very

1914
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,039
much up in the air like you know i

1915
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,440
i think i'm i'm always a bit naively

1916
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,559
optimistic

1917
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,240
uh and so i like to think that people

1918
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,760
are critical about what they read on the

1919
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,480
internet but

1920
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,880
i i think it was a joke somewhere i

1921
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,680
forget

1922
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,200
who said it but it's something like you

1923
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,720
know when i was growing up my mother

1924
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,319
told me don't get into a car with

1925
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,760
strangers

1926
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,559
and like now i literally summon

1927
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,440
strangers

1928
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,720
from my internet having mobile device

1929
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,280
to pick me up and to bring new places

1930
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:15,839
right

1931
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,120
uh like the uh i

1932
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,600
i i mean as some of you are pointing out

1933
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,158
it's it's sort of the connective tissue

1934
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,920
of a lot of relations especially post

1935
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,520
coval a lot of my friendships for

1936
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,198
example have been pursued over the

1937
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,080
internet

1938
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
uh so that's actually a very interesting

1939
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,158
point maybe the fact that this

1940
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,560
information is being presented

1941
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,439
through our friends that are sharing

1942
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,000
this

1943
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,479
uh information does tend to increase its

1944
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:43,520
precision for us

1945
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,880
and make it more salient 100 it's why

1946
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,520
the word of mouth recommendation of a

1947
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,080
product

1948
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,719
is the highest form it's why influencers

1949
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,080
try to be personable

1950
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,040
there's so much to that angle and using

1951
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,279
the pre-existing and the possible social

1952
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,080
networks

1953
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,560
to leverage uh the spreading of memes

1954
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,158
that might be just

1955
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,439
purely corrosive not even for or against

1956
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,759
one side just pure disinformation or

1957
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,399
pure things that uh are divisive let me

1958
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:12,960
just

1959
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,120
run through a few of our latter

1960
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,238
questions so we can

1961
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,640
get some more neurons firing connect

1962
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,560
some more ideas and stabilize these

1963
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,920
concepts

1964
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,120
so in this quote which um

1965
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,238
i will not read it's just about how

1966
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:30,238
cultural affordances are acquired

1967
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,080
through cultural practices

1968
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,158
and i found a really nice image that i

1969
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,520
thought tied together

1970
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,198
ontologies with culture so this is an

1971
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,880
image from the ontotext.com on the

1972
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,600
bottom there

1973
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,000
and it writes ontologies do not only

1974
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,920
introduce a shareable and reusable

1975
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,000
knowledge representation but can also

1976
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,439
add new knowledge about the domain so

1977
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,839
i had a few questions here about

1978
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,679
ontologies and that could be in that

1979
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:56,800
anthropological

1980
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,320
term the the anthropology or the

1981
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,920
ontological turn as maxwell was

1982
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,800
describing it

1983
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,360
or in the more computational sense like

1984
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,280
gene ontologies the structure of words

1985
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,120
that we use to describe genes so

1986
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,719
ontology in that sense means like a

1987
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,320
formal knowledge structure

1988
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,800
and about the attention and relationship

1989
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,400
between attention and ontology

1990
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,800
between ontologies and development and

1991
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,239
then especially for

1992
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,960
this group how do ontologies and active

1993
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,560
inference interact and how does that

1994
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,080
actually add knowledge

1995
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,640
to a situation rather than being a pure

1996
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,000
descriptor

1997
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,239
well i mean in part you don't grasp the

1998
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,080
world in a naked way

1999
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,840
right like we grasp it through our

2000
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,920
conceptual categories

2001
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,800
uh through the salience structures that

2002
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,159
are encoded in our

2003
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:46,159
conceptual categories in large part and

2004
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,440
uh yeah

2005
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,960
i mean the uh the point of having an

2006
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,320
ontology is to

2007
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,880
kind of you know fix the frame problem

2008
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,280
in a sense to kind of say okay what

2009
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,120
out of all these elements that could be

2010
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,040
monopolizing my attention at a given

2011
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,840
moment

2012
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,280
you know who are the relevant

2013
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,360
interlocutors that are deserving of my

2014
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,320
attention

2015
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,440
what are the salient aspects of the

2016
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,640
scene that require

2017
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,280
my processing yeah and in general

2018
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,040
what you know just in in the broad sense

2019
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,920
right

2020
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,840
what uh is kind of the

2021
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,440
otherwise you're just you know dealing

2022
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,199
with a sensory stream

2023
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,360
which is all fun and good but like so

2024
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,159
the ontology is what you bring to bear

2025
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,480
on the sensory stream to kind of parse

2026
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,520
things out

2027
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,719
from it yep and i i

2028
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,560
like where you took that it was exactly

2029
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,159
what i was thinking about like

2030
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,760
how many tennis balls can you fit in

2031
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,440
your hand maybe three maybe you have a

2032
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,960
large hand four tennis balls or

2033
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,840
something but

2034
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,920
you have a bag and you can cluster the

2035
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,520
tennis balls and you could pick up a bag

2036
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,040
with 100 tennis balls

2037
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,760
so that's the grip physical metaphor is

2038
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,560
the tools the affordances that cluster

2039
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,199
allow you to grip more and so similarly

2040
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:03,920
we can use

2041
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,280
ontologies of ideas and use that

2042
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,840
to get a grip on really high level

2043
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,640
concepts

2044
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,239
and then we'll pick up the double edged

2045
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,320
sword though right because

2046
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,000
uh i mean you know this is the problem

2047
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,480
of using priors in general is that you

2048
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,920
know you're starting from a point that

2049
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,679
might not be the right one

2050
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,760
and that might actually prevent you from

2051
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,960
uh you know so

2052
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,239
ontologies are the reason why we have

2053
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:32,000
you know the capacity to interact with

2054
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,159
each other for example as peers

2055
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,520
you know because we have these

2056
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,320
categories uh you are my peers and my

2057
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,840
friends and we can interact

2058
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,760
but you know ontologies are also

2059
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,920
responsible for racist behavior

2060
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,280
uh for sexism uh you know if i if my

2061
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,159
ontology says women are inferior uh

2062
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,880
to men or the people with dark skin but

2063
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,360
i don't

2064
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,440
believe any of that just to be

2065
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,360
clear but like if that if that is my

2066
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,840
ontology then i'm bound to treat

2067
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,880
uh others in a way that reflects those

2068
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,480
beliefs uh

2069
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,840
so i mean this is why they're so

2070
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,600
important to culture i think

2071
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,920
because they kind of it's it's not

2072
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,920
unrelated to this formal definition that

2073
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,440
you were discussing dan like

2074
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,400
it gives you the kind of general tracts

2075
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:16,800
that

2076
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
that you'll follow in your treatment of

2077
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,880
others uh so then it becomes

2078
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,040
interesting to you know use

2079
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,280
anthropological methods for example

2080
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,960
to see what are the ontologies that

2081
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,360
people are actually bringing to bear

2082
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,800
uh you know and to use that physical

2083
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,239
carrying metaphor so you go okay well i

2084
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,159
can hold three eggs in my hand

2085
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,840
i should have a bag with 500 eggs

2086
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,360
because i can pick it up well now you

2087
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,280
have none or you have a mess

2088
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,480
and so over simplification through any

2089
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,080
number of mechanisms

2090
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,000
within a value structure simply leads to

2091
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
false positives and false negatives

2092
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,640
and another way that we can bring in the

2093
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,159
free energy principle

2094
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,480
is the phrasing of free energy as model

2095
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,280
accuracy

2096
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,320
penalized by complexity and in some ways

2097
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,760
the extreme

2098
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,640
uh simple model let's say a one category

2099
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,719
model like all people are people

2100
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,920
or two or three category model and so

2101
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,159
do the models get more accurate in terms

2102
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,239
of reducing surprise as we include

2103
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,560
more and more parameters and then in the

2104
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,520
extreme case

2105
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,400
we have everyone as unique which is an

2106
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,440
interesting

2107
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,520
bookshelf you know end piece to contrast

2108
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,120
with this everybody's the same

2109
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,000
and so somewhere in between is where

2110
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,760
we're actually going to end up

2111
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,120
and so how do we help bring these

2112
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,840
implicit

2113
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,280
generative models of the world and our

2114
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,440
priors in into

2115
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,400
being shaped and designed and uh

2116
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,080
personally i think we never escape

2117
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,360
the value question and it's one thing

2118
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,120
to come together with somebody who has a

2119
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,640
different perspective and it's why it's

2120
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,840
so important to highlight coming

2121
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,440
together across differences

2122
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,280
because there's just no amount of

2123
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,440
cultural or genetic or whatever

2124
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,320
homogeneity

2125
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,040
that is going to prevent conflict and so

2126
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,280
instead we can have a coming together

2127
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,520
story about working together across

2128
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,320
differences

2129
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,520
rather than wedging tiny differences and

2130
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,920
that story itself is in a trade-off with

2131
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,560
essentially

2132
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,480
gaslighting and telling people that

2133
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,719
suffering is just part of how things are

2134
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,520
so there's so many trade-offs that exist

2135
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,280
um especially when we're talking about

2136
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,640
issues that matter most i mean we're not

2137
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,560
talking about species definitions in

2138
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,080
foxes we're talking about

2139
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,159
our own lives and our world in our

2140
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,440
ecosystem and so

2141
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,080
yes they're touchy topics and it's so

2142
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,040
important to be

2143
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,679
clear about what is and also what we

2144
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:34,640
want to see

2145
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,120
and so i i think there's so much that

2146
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,159
can be explored

2147
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,360
and expanded on here i i like that you

2148
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,760
brought in complexity minus accuracy

2149
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,960
uh because in a sense the you know

2150
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,040
this is this is a little bit a slightly

2151
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,480
looser way of thinking about it but

2152
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,640
in general you want as little boxes as

2153
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,000
possible right

2154
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,800
uh boxes i mean if you listen to

2155
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,560
buddhist wisdom for example boxes are

2156
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,400
the source of suffering right we

2157
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,199
we cling to our boxes we put things in

2158
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,239
boxes and

2159
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,080
and it makes it it makes us feel

2160
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,679
comfortable uh

2161
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:10,960
but really this is the source of

2162
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,040
suffering uh you know

2163
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,679
the this tendency to only be comfortable

2164
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,640
with things when they're

2165
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,199
nicely packaged in these kind of nice

2166
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,960
binary categories

2167
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,000
and this is why people uh get so like

2168
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,400
uncomfortable uh when these binaries get

2169
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,199
challenged

2170
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,199
you know by like gender fluidity and

2171
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,480
transness

2172
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,880
and these kinds of things on the flip

2173
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,880
side if we didn't have boxes at all we

2174
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,600
would die

2175
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
right uh you know you need to be able to

2176
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,080
parse that sensation as hunger

2177
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,000
uh in order to generate like you know

2178
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,120
appropriate

2179
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,120
survival generating uh behavior

2180
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,880
so i think that's like the the the

2181
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,040
fundamental paradox of human existence

2182
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,719
is both that we need

2183
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,159
uh boxes to survive but that they also

2184
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:56,480
are

2185
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,719
the source of much you know just

2186
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,920
suffering

2187
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,320
uh both that were inflicting to

2188
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,440
ourselves by

2189
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,880
forcing these kind of conceptual

2190
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,640
straitjackets onto ourselves

2191
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,480
but also because of the social wrongs

2192
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,239
that that can be uh

2193
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,480
the result of you know using the wrong

2194
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,600
ontology

2195
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,000
yep and cognitive diversity means

2196
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,520
differences in risk tolerance

2197
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,719
it means of course different

2198
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,640
perspectives unique perspectives

2199
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,360
and also um maybe on that explore

2200
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,520
exploit or on that model accuracy versus

2201
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,480
complexity

2202
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,880
some people will accept a more accurate

2203
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,480
model from their perspective

2204
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,800
that is also a lot more complex whereas

2205
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,520
somebody else is

2206
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,880
the coefficient of how much they're

2207
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,800
penalizing a complex model

2208
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,000
is different so they're going to come to

2209
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
a different conclusion and it's not

2210
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
as simple as right versus wrong in that

2211
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,040
situation it's

2212
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,880
model preference and could we take a

2213
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,719
step back could we reframe

2214
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,800
and understand how we're all part of the

2215
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,040
ensemble that's learning

2216
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,600
it would be nice let's go through a few

2217
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,239
of these

2218
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:56,800
last topics on communication and

2219
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,520
semiosis or meaning generation

2220
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,719
so here is from figure one of the paper

2221
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,880
which we discussed last time as far as

2222
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,400
what it was describing but here i want

2223
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,560
to connect it to one of the quotes

2224
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,360
they write conventions need not be

2225
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,000
explicitly

2226
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,159
formulated as rules and may instead

2227
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,159
originate in the actor's engagement with

2228
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,080
local backgrounds over time

2229
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,080
that is from non-contentful

2230
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,600
developmental experiences

2231
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,000
learning or participation in social and

2232
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,280
cultural practices

2233
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,440
to operate with conventional affordances

2234
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,960
agents must have shared sets of

2235
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,000
expectations

2236
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,080
we must know what others expect us to

2237
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,199
expect so

2238
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,520
yes we're hitting the same idea from

2239
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,480
figure one but

2240
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,159
there's a lot we're kind of spiraling

2241
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,920
another layer and coming back to this

2242
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,040
idea where

2243
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,640
we're in a remote group right now and so

2244
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,120
we are getting our expectations about

2245
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,880
what to expect and all these things

2246
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,960
not only are they going to be very

2247
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,480
different person to person because our

2248
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,360
local worlds are

2249
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,199
quite different but there's this

2250
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,719
algorithmic level

2251
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,679
that influences what we expect and it

2252
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:00,239
changes

2253
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,640
on the inputs that we receive and

2254
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,480
reducing our surprise about the sensory

2255
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,120
inputs

2256
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,920
is one of the drivers of behavior and so

2257
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,880
how does

2258
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,520
what we see in the news feed end up

2259
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,520
recapitulating the things that we

2260
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,360
will draw our attention to and that's

2261
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,440
sort of this self-radicalization

2262
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,600
process that can happen is attention is

2263
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,800
brought to something

2264
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,360
and then it continues to basically

2265
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,640
percolate upwards

2266
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,800
as people pay more and more attention

2267
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,719
and are more and more cautious or more

2268
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:29,840
and more aware

2269
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,960
of something that it's hard to take a

2270
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,880
step back from any scientific worldview

2271
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,880
and say that one is better or the other

2272
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,280
because although i'd love to hear a

2273
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,400
workaround

2274
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,960
it's hard to get a purely secular

2275
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,560
perspective because someone could say

2276
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,640
i'm just pursuing my accuracy by doing

2277
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,400
something that's aberrant to you

2278
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,520
and it's difficult to see

2279
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,000
purely within the framework nor does

2280
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,040
there have to be

2281
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,360
i think what free energy and active

2282
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,480
inference and focusing on the

2283
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,960
communication dynamics allows us to do

2284
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,600
is let our values be values let our

2285
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,199
communication be communication let our

2286
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:05,760
behavior

2287
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,199
be a behavior and uh talk about what we

2288
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,560
expect

2289
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,199
using ways that we want to communicate

2290
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,159
and if people don't want to use

2291
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,560
non-violent communication

2292
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,760
other people may or may not choose to

2293
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,080
communicate with them but it's um

2294
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,760
it change how we communicate what we

2295
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,280
expect when

2296
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,120
there's not only that computational

2297
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,719
intervention but also

2298
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,760
a lot of um you know coming together of

2299
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,280
different perspectives it's

2300
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,679
one of the challenges of our day and

2301
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,360
then also just

2302
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,239
this cultural iceberg was a nice image

2303
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:38,800
some of the

2304
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,080
the words are small in there but the

2305
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,840
quote on here is

2306
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,520
joint attention is usually understood as

2307
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,600
occurring in a diet of two people or

2308
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,080
between

2309
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,920
agents in direct interactional spheres

2310
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,920
of communication gaze following

2311
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,520
finger-pointing or other verbal or

2312
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,960
non-verbal cues

2313
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,480
to address more complex social

2314
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,480
situations it is useful to revise

2315
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,639
current sociocognitive models of joint

2316
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,239
attention to encompass

2317
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,560
fundamentally triadic situations in

2318
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,679
which the third

2319
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,600
is the socially constituted niche of

2320
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,440
affordances supported by local

2321
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,040
ontologies and abilities

2322
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,560
so before you have the questions just

2323
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,480
some of these in on the iceberg above

2324
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
the iceberg we have dress

2325
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,040
folklore language fine arts holidays

2326
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,679
food

2327
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,560
and below we have family values we have

2328
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,600
gender roles

2329
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,960
um pride concept of justice so this

2330
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,560
and there's different versions of the

2331
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,760
iceberg i just thought this one had a

2332
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,440
lot of nice ideas

2333
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,000
my questions here were what is the third

2334
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,480
member

2335
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,040
of a social interaction and how can

2336
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,880
active inference help us design culture

2337
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,320
if i can jump in quickly of it's sort of

2338
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:42,880
that

2339
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,239
so a human once in culture it is never

2340
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,520
alone

2341
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,440
in a sense uh we're always constantly

2342
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,080
seeing things through the eyes of others

2343
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,000
it starts off as what would mommy want

2344
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,120
me to do in this situation and it it

2345
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,080
just gen i mean

2346
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,920
it's it's remarkable canadians are

2347
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,600
really good at this uh we

2348
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,000
uh there were i i'd have to pull up the

2349
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,440
studies but there are

2350
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,040
there are studies that show that

2351
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,880
canadians even at night

2352
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,159
you know when there are no policemen

2353
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,000
will stop at a red light and just wait

2354
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,960
it out

2355
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,360
you know and and go even if there are no

2356
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,440
agents that could penalize them

2357
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,320
uh i mean it's really remarkable the

2358
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,360
extent to which we we internalize

2359
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,920
uh the these kinds of norms and they end

2360
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,280
up then directing

2361
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,440
uh the way that we interact with uh with

2362
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,880
others

2363
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,120
yeah any other thoughts on this or we

2364
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,840
can just it's it's something for

2365
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,719
pondering

2366
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,120
because we have the explicative portion

2367
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,639
of our experience which is

2368
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,920
that which comes to our conscious

2369
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,239
awareness that which is stated verbally

2370
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,600
but on the input side subconscious input

2371
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,440
and on the generative models that can't

2372
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,960
be expressed in words

2373
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,400
sometimes they can be expressed through

2374
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,080
art or through action

2375
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,480
but the whole iceberg is there and so

2376
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,080
it's just i really like that once you're

2377
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,520
in cultured you're never alone and

2378
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,159
indeed we are never alone because to be

2379
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:04,719
aware

2380
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,560
is to be communicating it's almost like

2381
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
the uh cog ergo sum

2382
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,120
it's like i communicate therefore we

2383
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,320
exist

2384
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,679
something like that um in this last

2385
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,120
page on um semiosis which i think is an

2386
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,760
interesting

2387
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,800
topic the authors wrote however

2388
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,719
cultural symbols and signs are usually

2389
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,560
poly semis that means having many or

2390
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,760
multiple meetings

2391
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,280
and their interpretation depends on

2392
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,800
context it's contextual

2393
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,120
our hypothesis is that feedback loops

2394
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,960
mediating shared attention and shared

2395
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,639
intentionality are the principal

2396
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:37,280
mechanism

2397
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,440
whereby cultural especially conventional

2398
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,120
affordances are acquired

2399
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,880
so conventional is fun i think in this

2400
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,800
setting because it alludes to

2401
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,159
conventional like normal

2402
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,920
like it's just the conventional approach

2403
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,760
it's the normal approach but also

2404
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,080
based upon convention and convention in

2405
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,440
that sense means both the coming

2406
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,960
together like it's a convention of the

2407
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,400
knife sharpeners or something

2408
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,719
but also it's a it's a joint it's agreed

2409
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,480
upon so it has many senses

2410
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,440
and it shows how normal and agreed upon

2411
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,000
often

2412
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,639
are related that's one symbol and so

2413
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:07,920
here was a

2414
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,520
few graphics that i found on a nice the

2415
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,159
dsproject.com

2416
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,719
so on the left is what is known as the

2417
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:15,360
piercing

2418
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,639
triad by c.s pierce and that's the sign

2419
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,960
the interpretant and the object and on

2420
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,840
the right is

2421
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,040
um sarsour who is another semitician

2422
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,520
though may have used different words and

2423
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,280
here we see that there's the signifier

2424
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,520
and the signified and then the referent

2425
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,080
and so i like this because it shows that

2426
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,960
there's multiple

2427
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,960
ontologies even when we're talking about

2428
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,440
sense making about meaning generation

2429
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,360
there's multiple ways we can parse that

2430
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,000
and do we choose to see it as a triad

2431
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,320
or do we choose to see it as a binary

2432
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,480
with another binary like the sr and the

2433
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,040
sd

2434
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,600
are one whole and then the frf is

2435
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,239
another

2436
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,000
you know is it a pair of binaries or is

2437
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,600
it just an integral

2438
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,760
triad so that's one way where there's

2439
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,920
multiple frameworks we can use just to

2440
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,239
talk about meaning generation

2441
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:05,120
and then this image is a representation

2442
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,400
by those authors about

2443
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,360
unlimited semiosis and this is sort of

2444
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,239
looking

2445
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,199
through time how that triad evolves and

2446
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,320
so i just thought

2447
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,080
how does this relate to active inference

2448
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,520
to that unfolding

2449
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,480
idea to this notion that our meaning

2450
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,199
generation

2451
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,440
our sense-making process is ongoing with

2452
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,639
respect to the symbols

2453
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,120
but we can modify those symbols as well

2454
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:27,920
so

2455
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,080
how can we maybe use active inference at

2456
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,400
least to grasp what are the outlines of

2457
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:41,440
this problem

2458
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,920
some of it i think was addressed in uh

2459
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,639
later

2460
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,040
papers for example uh i forget which

2461
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,120
active stream but when we talked about

2462
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,040
is the free energy principle a formal

2463
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,639
theory of semantics

2464
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,000
and it relates to that um

2465
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,400
i think it would probably be cool at

2466
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,239
almost the end of our time

2467
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,840
just to switch into

2468
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,000
panel mode and just see if anyone had

2469
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,800
any last thoughts that they wanted to

2470
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,440
talk about

2471
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,480
any last questions or where

2472
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,320
are you going with what we've discussed

2473
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,639
today what do you think would be a

2474
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,719
good question to leave people on or a

2475
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,159
good next step for us to take

2476
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,239
i thought this was a really interesting

2477
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,199
and useful

2478
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,960
exercise i'm super grateful

2479
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,920
to all of you for this continued uh this

2480
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,199
continued attention

2481
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,320
uh to the work that we've done uh yeah

2482
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,280
i i told the i told the team earlier but

2483
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,920
i've

2484
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,480
i've blocked off these uh mornings to

2485
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,560
participate regularly

2486
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,840
um so i mean i i i

2487
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,400
i'm very satisfied with this i think

2488
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,600
it's very cool

2489
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
and uh i think we've raised a lot of

2490
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,239
issues that could be pursued as papers

2491
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,520
uh yeah particularly this uh

2492
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,199
issue that you were raising alejandra

2493
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,639
about uh

2494
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,360
social networks and the way that they

2495
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,320
tie into

2496
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,440
uh attentional dynamics i think

2497
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,480
uh should be the target of much more

2498
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,679
uh discussion uh

2499
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,360
yeah i mean i i thought everyone had

2500
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,040
very very interesting

2501
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,520
uh things to say so thank you here's one

2502
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,239
angle on that

2503
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,320
is an evolutionary prior is that your

2504
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,360
social networks

2505
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,480
are constituted of people who are not

2506
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,159
adversarial with you

2507
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,679
most of the people who you're engaged

2508
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,760
with whether or not they believe the

2509
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,880
exact same thing

2510
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,960
you have to be relaxed enough around

2511
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,000
them to sleep

2512
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,960
for example and so the the deepest prior

2513
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,360
is

2514
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,639
if we're relating then we're going to be

2515
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:53,440
to some broad extent in agreement okay

2516
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,239
now we know from

2517
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,239
active inference and niche construction

2518
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:57,600
that the two ways that

2519
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,880
you can um deal with uncertainty or with

2520
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,639
unexpected sensory inputs

2521
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,880
is by changing the environment that's

2522
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,080
niche construction or

2523
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,000
by changing your internal model that's

2524
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,920
inference so what happens

2525
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,120
when you're in a social contrived

2526
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,639
situation it says oh but your friend

2527
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:15,440
posted this

2528
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,800
okay so it's coming in through the

2529
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,360
friend door and it's uh

2530
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,440
something that for my current value

2531
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,800
system at time t

2532
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,679
i think of is not chill there's all

2533
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:26,320
kinds of

2534
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,400
things not being chill but it just isn't

2535
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,920
and the two ways that i can

2536
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,639
deal with that are change my model to be

2537
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:33,440
more like that

2538
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
so i make that less surprising some type

2539
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,480
of hateful speech

2540
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,400
i get numb to it or i come to embody it

2541
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,239
actually to reduce my surprise on the

2542
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:42,800
inference

2543
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,400
side or i can get doubled down

2544
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,880
in my beliefs and try to reduce my

2545
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,480
uncertainty or the surprise from those

2546
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,520
sensory cues

2547
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,360
by getting into a debate i mean think

2548
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,880
about how much mental energy

2549
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,080
gets burnt on these sort of

2550
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,440
debates and people trying to change each

2551
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,199
other's mind online

2552
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,280
and there's something beautiful about

2553
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,840
people sharing their differences in idea

2554
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,920
but when that whole discussion is being

2555
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,199
basically

2556
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:15,040
overviewed by an algorithm that doesn't

2557
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,560
exactly have those people's mental

2558
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,080
health or the

2559
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,639
alignment of different cultures in mind

2560
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:21,360
not exactly

2561
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,679
yeah not not exactly you know it's

2562
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:24,480
correlated no

2563
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,360
it it can get off the rails and so that

2564
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,360
deep evolutionary prior isn't something

2565
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,880
that can just be unlearned like you were

2566
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880
speaking about earlier maxwell

2567
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,600
and so when our deepest prior and our

2568
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,679
intergenerational ones

2569
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,760
get taken advantage of it's like these

2570
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,280
slow waves

2571
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,560
and they can't quite cope with these

2572
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,840
very fast frequencies and so the options

2573
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,239
are to slow it down that's like the rko

2574
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,239
futurist you know oh well in the future

2575
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,440
we'll return to

2576
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,440
a more heterogeneous uh

2577
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,600
organization of people so slow down

2578
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
these high frequency waves

2579
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,600
or come to a better way that we can

2580
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,440
predict and communicate about them

2581
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
i mean there's a lot more that we could

2582
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,040
think about there but it just

2583
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,400
it's uh yeah there's yeah

2584
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,679
uh steven and then alejandra well i

2585
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,080
think

2586
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,840
like you were saying these ways that we

2587
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,000
think about what is happening

2588
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,520
um is really important in terms of how

2589
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,960
we construct our

2590
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,560
conversations but i think there's also

2591
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,159
the where and

2592
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,360
the where we've taken our attention

2593
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:35,040
to be able to have our conversations so

2594
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,000
when you're

2595
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,320
locked in they call it context collapse

2596
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,960
when you're on like facebook because you

2597
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,560
have no context you have

2598
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,440
no story you have no so one of the

2599
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,280
things with complex adaptive systems the

2600
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,679
workers cynthia kurtz and david snowden

2601
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:52,800
they work with

2602
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,920
um stories for small micro stories so

2603
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,560
you fight

2604
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,400
a hundred a thousand and start to

2605
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,960
make sense of them like attribute them

2606
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,440
with

2607
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:07,040
um titles and metadata and actually

2608
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,120
work with story because when you're

2609
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,960
working with story

2610
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,600
each story if it's kept raw so it's not

2611
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,880
an opinion

2612
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,400
they call it it's like it's kind of

2613
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,040
maintains the internal complexity of it

2614
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,280
so you can still reinterpret it but once

2615
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,480
you've got an opinion

2616
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,560
an opinion is collapsed down you can't

2617
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,480
really reinterpret an opinion

2618
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,159
so we're kind of trapped in these kind

2619
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,719
of interpretive kind of

2620
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,600
inductive deductive spaces which is

2621
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,440
great if it's a case of like i have the

2622
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,719
right answer or you have the right

2623
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:37,520
answer

2624
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,600
so then we can like debate it but the

2625
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,360
trouble is what if we don't know

2626
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,840
and no one wants to admit they don't

2627
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,199
know um

2628
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,440
can we work with something more complex

2629
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,239
and

2630
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,719
maybe that's a rare question as a how

2631
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,719
question not a what question

2632
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:56,000
a knife alejandra

2633
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,199
um yeah and

2634
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,840
and i i totally agree and also taking

2635
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,280
what uh

2636
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,639
sasha said that the idea

2637
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,960
that we are talking with our friends and

2638
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,760
and

2639
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,800
yeah that's like the

2640
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,159
like our conscious um

2641
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,040
internal belief they are our friends but

2642
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,520
we

2643
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:26,320
actually not have any idea

2644
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,360
how these platforms work

2645
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,040
um how these platforms are manipulating

2646
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,920
our attention so we are communicating

2647
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,120
with others

2648
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,480
but we have something

2649
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,120
between this communication that we don't

2650
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,960
know actually how is working

2651
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,400
and um i don't know i i was

2652
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,360
thinking that um they are kind of

2653
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,320
playing

2654
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,080
in terms of active inference to

2655
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,440
constantly increase

2656
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,880
our prediction never um and you have to

2657
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,679
engage with with this platform in order

2658
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:02,320
to

2659
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,440
reduce or minimize prediction error

2660
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,480
in terms of emotions or um

2661
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,199
the way i react to other um giving a

2662
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:11,840
like

2663
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,920
or um sharing a post so um

2664
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,320
i don't know this idea that we are

2665
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,679
interacting

2666
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,040
with friends or we're um close

2667
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,159
people but we don't know what's

2668
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,440
happening in between

2669
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:31,120
sasha um

2670
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,280
yeah i think that that's a great point

2671
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,120
um to touch on that

2672
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,520
we don't really understand what's

2673
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,400
happening

2674
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,440
uh this hidden state between um

2675
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,719
us and the person that we're trying to

2676
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,639
communicate with and how that's being

2677
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:45,760
manipulated

2678
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,320
and while that's that's a totally valid

2679
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,679
critique of social

2680
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,480
media platforms um we could say the same

2681
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,120
thing for

2682
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
like telephone communication or even

2683
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,159
telegram

2684
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,560
um the people who were sending the

2685
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,480
message shouldn't necessarily understand

2686
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,320
what was happening um

2687
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,360
in in that process and yet

2688
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,040
uh they felt or they they would trust

2689
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,320
that it was um the integrity of the

2690
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,840
message was maintained

2691
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,719
or that it wasn't uh nothing was lost in

2692
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:19,520
that process

2693
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,080
or manipulated but so it's been kind of

2694
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,760
like a steady

2695
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,040
a steady march of uh

2696
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,679
technol technological advances that are

2697
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,040
more and more removed

2698
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,080
from what we think we're doing in this

2699
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,920
process of communication

2700
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,280
yep the neutral claim is that context

2701
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,280
directs attention so if there's a bunch

2702
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,119
of arrows pointing to something even

2703
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,719
though it's not in the exact object it

2704
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:46,400
will draw your attention to it or

2705
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,760
something that's placed on top of a

2706
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,760
pyramid is what your attention is

2707
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,280
supposed to be drawn towards

2708
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,920
well in the telegram case not the app

2709
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,560
the

2710
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,440
the morse code version the context is

2711
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,440
that you trust that western union or

2712
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,000
whomever

2713
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,239
isn't going to be garbling your message

2714
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,840
and the context is who it's from

2715
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,760
and so you can actually unpack it as if

2716
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,440
that person were just telling you

2717
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,159
but when it's a stranger and it's like

2718
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:10,960
engaging

2719
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,040
the gas and the break on is this an

2720
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,159
adversary or not

2721
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,960
and the context is constrained so you

2722
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,920
can only see

2723
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,199
their name or a fake internet name and a

2724
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,159
picture

2725
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,199
and then is it a surprise that given

2726
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,280
a picture and what somebody says

2727
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,719
somebody's gonna unpack it

2728
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,600
in potentially the least charitable way

2729
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,199
based upon identity or

2730
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,920
based upon a typo based upon some sort

2731
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,600
whereas in person we just look at each

2732
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,159
other

2733
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,480
and we can have more of this human sense

2734
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,000
we can have the context

2735
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,239
and that helps us understand and then

2736
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,440
beyond the context

2737
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,119
cues when we can actually feel like

2738
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:49,440
we're part of a shared society

2739
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,199
then we want to help people who are in

2740
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,280
need in our local worlds

2741
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,840
and there's only one world so it is our

2742
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,800
local world

2743
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,560
spaceship earth so there's there's so

2744
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,639
many angles and the question would just

2745
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:01,199
be

2746
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:04,159
what are those on ramps and then how is

2747
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:04,639
it all

2748
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,320
going to actually play out any

2749
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,520
final thoughts though because this was

2750
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,679
an awesome discussion great

2751
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,159
follow-up and there's we could have

2752
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,199
talked for

2753
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,199
longer on just four point two three four

2754
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:20,159
five but next week we'll move to five

2755
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:23,600
and so if there's no further thoughts

2756
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,440
i really appreciate everybody coming

2757
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,800
together thanks for

2758
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,800
the attention to those participants and

2759
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,800
also to our listeners

2760
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,520
we'll always be even weeks later

2761
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,719
accepting

2762
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:36,960
input on what papers what topics what

2763
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,520
questions would be cool to discuss

2764
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,080
and so yes thank you it's been a great

2765
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,400
stream
