post-doctoral researcher cool

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
well welcome everyone thanks so much for

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,400
coming on

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
filling out the hollywood square that we

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
have here

90
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
for these warm-up questions it'll be

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
great to hear from everyone just

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
raise your hand if you have a thought

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
i'll just put up the first two

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
totally just raise your hand as you want

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
to add something

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
first would be what is something about

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
human personality or

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
emotions that you would want to see

99
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,720
captured in

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
a good model or understanding or

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
education

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
and then also what is something that you

103
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,680
liked

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
or remembered about the paper

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,080
and um i think there was a few memorable

106
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,720
parts

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
of the paper just while people are

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,479
raising their hand

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,360
uh i think just the idea of going from a

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,240
statistical

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
understanding of the big five as

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
principal component dimensions

113
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,199
to being the outputs of a cybernetic

114
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
system is really an interesting

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,240
topic so maybe

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
if uh anyone wants to raise their hand

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
on this one

118
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,479
or adam or colin

119
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,680
maybe how do you go about introducing

120
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
uh the the need for your kind of paper

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
to an audience like where do you start

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
out with the interesting part about

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
personality that you want to capture

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
in your model

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
well uh shall i jump in then yeah

126
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
and when you say raised hand do you mean

127
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
this little button here or

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
you can like actually just wave at the

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
screen probably with the button

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,840
all right works that works

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
um so uh one of the things that i

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,479
noticed in your

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
summary of the paper was something that

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,479
i

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
often encounter from people working in

136
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
other scientific fields

137
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
which is a certain degree of skepticism

138
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,360
about

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
the big five because of their origin in

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,080
uh natural language and

141
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
um and because you know when you see a

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
diagram that's like a hierarchy of

143
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,199
personality traits

144
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
i you know in a figure there i was

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
careful to note that that is not

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
supposed to be a diagram of causal

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
structure in the individual because

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
there's this interesting problem where

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
we use the same visual language for

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
causal models of you know boxes and

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
circles and arrows

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
and for statistical models in which

153
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
we're looking at the relationships among

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
variables but obviously those are not

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
directly

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
translatable and

157
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
so the way that i would pose the basic

158
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,919
question that's of interest here is

159
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
why do certain traits of people tend to

160
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,720
cluster together

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
i think that that's really the core of

162
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
what i'm interested in

163
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
and what we're interested in if we're

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
talking about the sources of personality

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
a lot of personality research in the

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
last 40 years

167
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
or so since the big five demerged as

168
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,199
kind of an organizing consensus

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,000
framework

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
has really been focused on questions of

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
prediction like if we have these

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
assessments of people's personality

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,160
tendencies

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
what kind of outcomes does it predict

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,840
for them

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
um also potentially like what are

177
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,599
trajectories of uh

178
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
change and development of these things

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
over time but i'm interested in a

180
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
question that

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
is a lot less studied which is where

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
these patterns come from in the first

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
place

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,400
and so i think the way that to think

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
about the kind of statistical element

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
here is simply that

187
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
there is an observation that if we have

188
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
a large set of descriptions

189
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
of uh people's personality and it

190
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,199
doesn't have to be

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
from the natural language that was just

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
one good source for a relatively

193
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
unbiased set of descriptions

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
of people was to go into the dictionary

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
and just pull out the adjectives that

196
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,199
could describe people

197
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
um but we see a very similar pattern of

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
factors like the big five if we start

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
with a lot of say existing personality

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,319
questionnaires that weren't designed to

201
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,599
measure the big five you throw them all

202
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,240
together

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
you still get the big five so as long as

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
we have a sufficiently

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
large set of descriptions of personality

206
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
and we have ratings on them

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
they tend to cluster together in

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
reliable ways and

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
as long as they are valid you know as

210
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
long as when we say that somebody's

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
talkative that really does mean that

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
they talk more than other people do

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,080
and there's a lot of evidence for the

214
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
basic levels of validity

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
of personality ratings then the question

216
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
is

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,199
why is it that people who are talkative

218
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,319
also tend to

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,599
be uh more sociable also tend to

220
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,160
experience

221
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,400
more positive emotions also tend to be

222
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
more physically active

223
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
also tend to be uh let's say more

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,759
interested in

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
excitement and uh dangerous um

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
you know risky pursuits so we've got a

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
whole bunch of things that cluster

228
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
together and the question is why

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,479
um and so you know that was a list of

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,839
low-level traits that are grouped

231
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
together within extraversion

232
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,959
and that's just a statistical

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
observation those people who tend to

234
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,200
have

235
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
more of one of those things also tend to

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
have more of another and so i see

237
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,920
fundamentally

238
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
the question that i'm interested in is

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
what are the underlying

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
mechanisms that vary from person to

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
person

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
that drive these patterns of

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
co-occurrence of particular

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
characteristics

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
thank you for that shannon

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
thanks for that um really nice sort of

247
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
overview introduction

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,760
um i was sort of wondering going through

249
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,959
this paper

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
you talk about what are the differences

251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
that are

252
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
can be ascribed to individuals and their

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
individual personalities

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
that lead to you know traits like

255
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
extroversion or what have you

256
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,720
um but what if there is nothing

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,959
unique to any individual that gives rise

258
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
to a personality trait

259
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
and i wonder where does um culture and

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
social interaction

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,120
fit into this kind of model

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
and that's just a question that i'm

263
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,160
interested in throughout

264
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
the next couple of hours that we're here

265
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
today

266
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
nice good question anyone i put up also

267
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,519
the third one blue

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
so something as i was wondering about

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
like as i was reading the paper

270
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,079
was you know the big five personality

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,880
and like

272
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
it's um you know grounded in genetic

273
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,200
uh influences right um

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
but like attachment theory and like

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
there's like a bunch of work that's been

276
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
done in mice like showing like you know

277
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,760
the nurturing of parents

278
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,279
and you know whether you're attachment

279
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
avoidant or attachment anxious

280
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
or um you know attachment secure that's

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
also something i think would be fun and

282
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
interesting to

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
um model in in the free energy kind of

284
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
way like put into this framework

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
and i think it has like some cool um

286
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
you know impacts for like team building

287
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
and and how

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
um you know like whether i don't know i

289
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,959
just think it'd be it would be

290
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,079
interesting and maybe

291
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
um impactful in in this kind of

292
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,600
framework

293
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
cool and blue to that point i just saw a

294
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
paper this uh

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
morning from anna sunica at all and axel

296
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,000
constant

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,040
the first prior from co-embodiment to

298
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,920
co-homeostasis in early life

299
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
about this transition from like a truly

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,440
in utero

301
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
embedded being to different types of

302
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
physiological

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,880
dependencies social and cultural so it

304
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,399
is interesting to think about

305
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,320
all right we have an individual

306
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
orientation around the big five

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
it's about the individual in

308
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
relationship to different types of

309
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,399
settings

310
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
but then how do you capture that element

311
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,399
of niche construction

312
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
or of group dynamics or of these other

313
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,160
aspects that are

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,519
relational i'm just curious colin or or

315
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
adam like where does the uh

316
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,920
other how does that enter into it this

317
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,880
idea of the

318
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,000
cultural influences in on personality

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
because someone's personality might be

320
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
manifested in a really specific setting

321
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,600
because of

322
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,880
their local context oh i could just say

323
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
something about that that is relevant i

324
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
think to both of the two questions that

325
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,040
have just been

326
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
asked uh which is just to keep in mind

327
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,079
that

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,839
um these personality traits are

329
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,279
descriptions of

330
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
uh you know persistent patterns of

331
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
people's behavior

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
and we know that they are genetically

333
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,279
influenced but we also know that they're

334
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,839
not

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,160
entirely determined by genetics they are

336
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
also determined by environmental

337
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
influences

338
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
and so the way that i think about this

339
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
is that you have these uh you know these

340
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
mechanisms that are

341
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
allowing people to function and some

342
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,800
parameters of those mechanisms

343
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
must be reasonably persistent to produce

344
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,120
these persistent patterns of behavior

345
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
but the the things that set those

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
parameters and that tweak them if

347
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,839
there's change in personality over time

348
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
can be both uh genetically

349
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
programmed and environmentally

350
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
programmed right so there are things

351
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
there are events that happen to people

352
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
for example their relations to their

353
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
primary caregiver and attachment that

354
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
shape what these settings are going to

355
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
be persistently

356
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
in life and so i think there's

357
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,760
definitely room for

358
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
thinking about environmental inputs uh

359
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,120
to these systems

360
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
and shaping of these parameters uh as

361
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
well as genetic ones

362
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,519
ooh and colin at this point you raised

363
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
earlier about

364
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
graphical models and just drawing a

365
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
connection

366
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
among different variables is that a

367
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
causal model is that a statistical model

368
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,839
are those different what if you're

369
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
talking about causal entropy or you're

370
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,639
doing a

371
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
causal uh you know model like a

372
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
structural equation modeling

373
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,000
or even if it's a linear aggression it's

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
going to be interpreted as a causal

375
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,720
influence and

376
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
they'll put in the discussion oh it

377
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
could be a different way it could just

378
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
be correlation but

379
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
it's really hard to disentangle that um

380
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
yeah marco

381
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,360
hi thanks um so first of all uh i

382
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,639
haven't really read the paper

383
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
kind of recently got out of a pandemic

384
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,240
slumber

385
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
um but but it sounds very interesting

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,600
from what i've read and heard so far

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
and as for the first question about what

388
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
i'd like to see it might be a bit

389
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,160
um in the far future but i think ideally

390
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,600
um this would all

391
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
connect sooner or later to the work on

392
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
neuro phenomenology

393
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
the kind of ideal vision i have is for

394
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
example now we've been talking about

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
genetic priorities and environmental

396
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,600
inputs

397
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
but i think the beautiful part about

398
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,360
cybernetics is the kind of reflexive

399
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
action

400
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
and so consciousness or phenomenology

401
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
is basically a mediator or moderator of

402
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,199
the way that's

403
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,959
environmental inputs kind of influence

404
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
our continuing progression

405
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
of personality or um traits and and

406
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,959
characteristics

407
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,480
and so ideally um i would love to see a

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
well i would love to hear if it's

409
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
possible to make a synthesis of for

410
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
example

411
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
the work from psychoanalysis

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
psychotherapy everything that kind of

413
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
uh explores and navigates these

414
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
particular mechanisms

415
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
from a first person kind of view how to

416
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,320
navigate the experience

417
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
of being engaged in the world and i'm

418
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
just wondering about

419
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
adam's or conan someone else's thoughts

420
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
on how to possibly connect

421
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
that phenomenological description of

422
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
mechanisms and processes

423
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,720
with the more formal basic models that

424
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
we're

425
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
now exploring in this kind of work if

426
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
that makes sense

427
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,040
yeah very nice adam and then anyone else

428
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
uh hello can you hear me yep yeah great

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,279
um so i guess uh uh try to

430
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,560
address a couple of things um

431
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
so yeah uh yeah marco just thrust us

432
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,399
into like the deepest possible territory

433
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,839
like right away

434
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
um and so i guess i'll briefly comment

435
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
on that uh

436
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
second but it's the first thing in terms

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
of um

438
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
social context and

439
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,560
uh niche construction and the more

440
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
intersubjective

441
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,759
aspects and contexts um sensitivity of

442
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
personality

443
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,440
uh active inferential modeling is really

444
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
well equipped to

445
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,680
address all of that uh in this paper it

446
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,639
was more

447
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,519
uh the focus was just kind of exploring

448
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,480
what uh

449
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
colin and i both perceive to be a very

450
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,600
rich set of correspondences between

451
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
the free energy principle and active

452
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
inference and uh

453
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,519
his theory of cybernetic big five theory

454
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,160
but on

455
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,440
um modeling work you can

456
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
uh bring in all of those details and

457
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,600
explore them in their particular so

458
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
i'm currently collaborating on a project

459
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
where we're trying to model things like

460
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,880
extroversion

461
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
within these um social choice tasks and

462
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
so

463
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
how you show up it's going to be a

464
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,839
function

465
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
of you know both the task environment

466
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
and you

467
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,199
as this interaction that's going to

468
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,399
evoke a given

469
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,279
style of pattern but you'll have these

470
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,040
um parameters uh

471
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
these hyper priors are over

472
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
the different aspects of the generative

473
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,279
model

474
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,040
which through iterated policy selection

475
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,759
and uh updating will basically

476
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,600
concentrate their probability mass in

477
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
different ways

478
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
and result in different

479
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,560
parameterizations and then different

480
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,440
emergent behavior and what you can see

481
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,279
happen is you can get

482
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,680
these basically attractors formed as

483
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,079
this process proceeds over time

484
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,240
these behavioral attractors where you

485
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
the concentration of your prior for

486
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,959
engaging in the world in a certain way

487
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,280
causes you to enact a given pattern

488
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,919
which causes you to

489
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,599
even more update in that direction like

490
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
your your d matrix like where am i in

491
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,039
this environment

492
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
uh you know what do you expect to be

493
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,799
perceiving your a matrices all the

494
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
different like components that you use

495
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
to try to

496
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
model the parts of an agent these are

497
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
all your priors of these will get

498
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
updated

499
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
will then cause the pattern of action so

500
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
on and so forth and that

501
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
over time this could cause you to be in

502
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
this attractor where you have this

503
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,039
enduring stability um how enduring you

504
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,760
know it would depend on

505
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,640
a variety of things uh and

506
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
but so i guess that's one so in this

507
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
process

508
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
uh the social context who you're

509
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
interacting with

510
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
that would make all the difference in

511
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
terms of like how the kind of ball

512
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
rolls down this epigenetic landscape

513
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
like how you end up like

514
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
carving out a given pattern for this

515
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
agent

516
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,799
uh with respect to uh neurophenomenology

517
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,880
and just the uh actually getting

518
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,320
the richness of experience

519
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
there's a sense in which all active

520
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
inferential modeling is already in a way

521
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,799
um kind of personality modeling

522
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,160
it's like you're kind of getting into

523
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,480
like um

524
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
these enduring um you know

525
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,120
the cybernet what they're thinking them

526
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
as these like cyber data

527
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,440
parameters for this fundamental process

528
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
um

529
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,080
or just the your ability to describe

530
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
um the essence of the system uh the

531
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
it's it's normal form description this

532
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
this maximally encompassing a

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
description of the modes of where you

534
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
expect

535
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
to find the system as a kind of

536
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
probabilistic density in some kind of

537
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,559
multi-dimensional phase space if you

538
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
have such a

539
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
attracting network structure that you

540
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
can describe in a way you could call

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
that the personality of the system

542
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
um but cybernetic big five theory um

543
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
kind of goes further

544
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
and uh or it it's grounding this in

545
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,080
terms of well

546
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,360
why should we expect certain modes

547
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
over others why should we expect that

548
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
relates it back to this fundamental

549
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,679
cybernetic cycle of gold pursuit that

550
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,360
any agent has to do

551
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,960
um so with respect to neurophenomenology

552
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
and

553
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
it seems like the attempts to get at

554
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
this within active inference things like

555
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
uh sophisticated effective inference the

556
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
the models of uh

557
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
metacognition where they're beginning to

558
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
model like kinds of mindful processing

559
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,080
of reflecting on your um

560
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
your confidence and and then this

561
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,840
influencing your

562
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,880
uh you you

563
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,240
having an actual model of your epistemic

564
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,039
status

565
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,120
you reflect you're reflecting on this

566
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
and this influencing how you sample

567
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,320
influencing

568
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,840
uh how confident you are in different

569
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,559
ways um influencing what policies you

570
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,200
end up

571
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
deploying these things that to the

572
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,280
extent that

573
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
they allow for um phenomenological

574
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
richness

575
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
they could be brought into an agent

576
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,559
model

577
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,440
and you're beginning to do a connection

578
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
between neurophenomenology

579
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
or a process theory of that wood dock of

580
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
phenomenology

581
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
and personality modeling so those are

582
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,120
some thoughts

583
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
nice thanks and to add on that adam

584
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
because that was really

585
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
well said it's almost like some of these

586
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
past papers we've been discussing

587
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,480
were the neutral infrastructure or the

588
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
architecture or the tools

589
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
to have agents that can have memory or

590
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
can have affect or

591
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,799
can perceive valence or get worried so

592
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,640
we talked that in a very neutral

593
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
framework like it's a parameter in the

594
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
model however in the real world

595
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
as colin was getting at there's these

596
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,559
extremely deep

597
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
correlations with different outcomes of

598
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,559
systems people who like to text more

599
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,000
also like to video chat more or

600
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,559
something

601
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
and that might not be surprising but it

602
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,919
these trends are

603
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,720
very distinct and so we are getting at

604
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,919
this generative

605
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
model idea personality as a generator

606
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
of outcomes in different niches so

607
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
inseparable from the niche

608
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
and um it's just an interesting

609
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
way to see how the cybernetic big five

610
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
has come from a more psychological area

611
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,840
so it has uh that sort of um

612
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
toe of the neurophenomenology and the

613
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
real correlations in the world

614
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
and then there's the neutral framework

615
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
that sort of maps onto that

616
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,559
we have stephen and then colin

617
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,400
yeah i like what's been said about

618
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,080
neurophenomenology and i'd also

619
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,919
say that one of the things that's good

620
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
about the this this work with traits

621
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,280
is it it's starting to bring work that's

622
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
coming from

623
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
um what you could say realist settings

624
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
codifying it and then finding the

625
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,320
patterns

626
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,880
and it's giving us more material coming

627
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
the other way we've had some work around

628
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,919
a lot of work with affordances and

629
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
niches and then obviously you've got the

630
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
models which start to create

631
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,640
dynamics and show and then you start to

632
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
see where these two things meet

633
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
but i would also say micro i've been

634
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
looking a lot of micro phenomenology

635
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
and the actual structuring of experience

636
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,159
and attention

637
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,640
and i think that um what can be

638
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
interesting is these traits if these

639
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
traits can also get brought down into

640
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
micro phenomenology

641
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
and ways of like how is

642
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,200
the structure of the environment body

643
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,480
mind

644
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,480
um happening and and where

645
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,559
are there times because what i think

646
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,880
with a lot of the trait works is it does

647
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,960
have a normative assumption about the

648
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
type of life someone's in

649
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,400
around which you then standardize

650
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
and then get these patterns but you do

651
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,640
find if you take

652
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,960
people into some other types of space or

653
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,440
other types of attentional state

654
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
be a more grounded state maybe a

655
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
performative state maybe a

656
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
space which is less western so to speak

657
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
less gold orientated um that might shift

658
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
so this might be like this is where that

659
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,760
is when people are at this normative

660
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,480
mediated uh sort of normative like

661
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
calculated way of getting everyone

662
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
that's like the goal directed norm for a

663
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,520
westerner

664
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
um and then can these different

665
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
components to that be sort of treated

666
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
and also looked at how do they vary

667
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,960
as we move like not just as the fire but

668
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
in you know as

669
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
individual kind of um tap

670
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
ways to tap into affordances when do

671
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
these change more or less when we bring

672
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,200
people into another type of

673
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
way of a regime of attention or another

674
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
set of performances which is outside the

675
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
normal

676
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
for our cultural goal-driven

677
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
way of being in the west okay

678
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,720
colin and then marco i just had a couple

679
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,600
of thoughts about

680
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
uh phenomenology since that's been a

681
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
theme um

682
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,320
recently um first of all i think one

683
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,039
interesting thing

684
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,039
to think about in relation to uh trait

685
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,080
approaches is that when we do

686
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,559
assessments of personality using

687
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,000
self-report questionnaires

688
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
you know which is not the only way that

689
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
you can do it of course you can have

690
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,919
other people

691
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,440
you know rate the personality of

692
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,279
somebody and we tend to see very similar

693
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
results if we use other people's ratings

694
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,480
versus self ratings

695
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
um although there's also evidence that

696
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,919
there's some incremental validity there

697
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,640
in other words

698
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
you know things about yourself that

699
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,760
other people don't know so that there's

700
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
some unique validity to your reports

701
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
but other people also know things about

702
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,120
you that you don't know so there's also

703
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
some unique validity to other people's

704
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
reports on your personality

705
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
but as long as we're talking about the

706
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
self reports then that is at base a kind

707
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,640
of

708
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
you know crude phenomenological measure

709
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,840
right because you're saying

710
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,039
what are you like what is your

711
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
experience of yourself like are you the

712
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
kind of person who's anxious

713
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,480
are you the kind of person who likes art

714
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,679
you know and we get

715
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,159
a long list of people's responses on

716
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,159
these things and then we

717
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,600
infer their general patterns of behavior

718
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,400
from them and so i do think you know one

719
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,360
of the things that i've always been

720
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,120
interested in is that personality is not

721
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
just patterns of

722
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
behavior from a third person perspective

723
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,799
it's also patterns of experience

724
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
from a first person perspective and so

725
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
when we look at the contents of

726
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,520
personality questionnaires you know they

727
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
involve descriptions of emotion

728
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,799
and types of cognition and patterns of

729
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,600
motivation

730
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,279
that can all be experienced you know

731
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,960
phenomenologically in the first person

732
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,279
as well and so we're using this kind

733
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
of first person representation and

734
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
understanding of ourselves to then try

735
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
to infer these general patterns of

736
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
behavior that have validity

737
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
from an objective third person

738
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
perspective as well

739
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,919
and then just in terms of like drilling

740
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,919
down to this kind of micro phenomenology

741
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,200
idea

742
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,520
we do know things about particular

743
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
patterns of processing that are

744
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,720
associated with different

745
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
personality traits uh so for example we

746
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
just published a paper showing that

747
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
extroversion is associated with the

748
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
tendency to be influenced by

749
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
uh reward in an implicit learning

750
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
context

751
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
right so you're doing a task where

752
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
you're making this like discrimination

753
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,799
between two very similar options

754
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,919
um and you're rewarded more

755
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,840
for getting correct responses to one

756
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
option relative to the other well what

757
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
you see is that

758
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
people's behavior becomes biased toward

759
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,679
that option

760
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,440
but the degree it becomes biased is

761
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
actually correlated with extroversion

762
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,320
and that's part of how we

763
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
you know have support for the theory

764
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,440
that fundamentally what

765
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
causes all of these different

766
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,559
extroverted behaviors to cohere

767
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,000
is sensitivity to reward and so you can

768
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,080
think of that from the third person as

769
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,520
like here's a process of

770
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,960
you know reward mapping

771
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
but you can also think well what is it

772
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,159
like from the for this individual

773
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,600
this is the kind of person who's going

774
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
to be more uh perceptive of

775
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,039
possibilities

776
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
for uh rewarding interactions for

777
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,960
incentives

778
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,399
in their environment so i think you can

779
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,919
always sort of flip back and forth

780
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,279
between taking the

781
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,679
phenomenological and the more uh

782
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,960
third-person perspective on these things

783
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
cool thanks marco

784
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
yeah uh thanks actually um kind of ties

785
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,159
into that because i was kind of

786
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,200
wondering if you could share some

787
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
thoughts on the relation between value

788
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,840
systems such as

789
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,559
pragmatic value or affect and epistemic

790
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
salience and curiosity

791
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,559
with this uh model of personality for

792
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,440
example uh

793
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
i did read the jews that the fundamental

794
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
components are

795
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,679
um the goal the interpretation and the

796
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,039
strategy right

797
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,520
um and i would say that that value i

798
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,039
mean i would guess that value is more

799
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,520
about

800
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
the interpretation right so that you

801
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,000
have some kind of scalar or some other

802
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
dimension by which you can compare

803
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
certain current

804
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
real states and expected states um

805
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,039
and tie into that uh i guess it's a

806
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,480
separate question

807
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
but i think i guess i'm going back to

808
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,399
the personality and phenomenology

809
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,080
because maybe you could share some

810
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
thoughts and to what extent

811
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
personality can be seen as an as a

812
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
natural consequence

813
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
of the cybernetic imperative where

814
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,640
consciousness has

815
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,120
basically instrumentalized to be the

816
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,960
regulator of

817
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
the entire mind body system as it were

818
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
because i guess i have some image a

819
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
picture of

820
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,000
regimes of reflexive attention right so

821
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,360
there must be some cybernetic

822
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
system or set of systems an ecosystem if

823
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,399
you will

824
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,640
um that's regulating or controlling the

825
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
entire mind body system

826
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,200
or large portions of it but that in

827
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
itself then has to

828
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,399
necessarily by free energy or active

829
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,399
inference have to have some kind of

830
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,440
um uh imperative to decide

831
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
or policies to pick and how to engage

832
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,799
with that

833
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,000
bigger mind-body ecosystem if that makes

834
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,600
sense beautiful thank you adam

835
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,799
and then anyone else

836
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,679
darn it marco uh that was awesome yeah

837
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,240
that was epic it wasn't

838
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
and then sasha and then we'll leave the

839
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
warm-up uh

840
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,120
so i guess uh

841
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,799
two things kind of or a few things

842
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,039
coming to mind um

843
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,799
so i really like this idea of thinking

844
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,360
of

845
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,640
um your consciousness as a

846
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
as a kind of modeling for the sake of

847
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
cybernetic control

848
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,320
and uh with hopefully you know some

849
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,679
degree of

850
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,279
not perfect but some degree of fidelity

851
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,000
for modeling that which is modeled a

852
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,960
good regular theorem to regulate a

853
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
system you have to have a decent enough

854
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,160
model

855
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,559
[Music]

856
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,799
the and so there's a sense in which

857
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,840
um towards this end

858
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
uh being able to

859
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,159
have your modeling process reflect on

860
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,120
itself

861
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,679
and model itself uh that that could be a

862
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,559
very useful thing uh if you get it right

863
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
um and a very bad thing if you get it

864
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,080
wrong um

865
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,159
the and so it relates to things like

866
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,840
and it could even be that you know these

867
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,799
parameter tunings for these

868
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,559
they might stripe it across like

869
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,080
multiple levels

870
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,399
of abstraction something like curiosity

871
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
so you could have like a kind of

872
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,600
um uh curiosity that has a phenomenology

873
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,720
in terms of the way like

874
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,159
a physicist would describe it as like a

875
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
phenomenological description of behavior

876
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,000
that's just like showing the emergent

877
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
behavior and this looks like a more

878
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,679
curious system in the way it's like

879
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,080
sussing out state space then you might

880
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,440
also get to like

881
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,799
the curiosity in terms of the

882
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,399
what it feels like to be curious and

883
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,840
what those those

884
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,600
motivations those free energy gradients

885
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,880
are going to try to annihilate

886
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,600
those different sources of desire of

887
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,399
pull

888
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,760
um what that's like experientially

889
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,519
and so yeah it seems like something like

890
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,240
curiosity would be reflected at multiple

891
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,840
levels of organization

892
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,039
uh maybe even some weird shifts in terms

893
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
of like the way it shows up across

894
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,480
levels of analysis um

895
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,080
the a few

896
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,360
other ideas are coming to mind would be

897
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,720
um there seems to be a sense in which

898
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,799
if so we're talking about you know

899
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,480
someone reporting on

900
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,840
their experience um you can think of

901
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,080
these reports both in terms of

902
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,279
the uh perceptual inferences

903
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,480
that are uh going into them and then the

904
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,320
report is a kind of action it's a kind

905
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
of act of inference

906
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
and uh each of these aspects you know

907
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,919
for

908
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,120
instance like you could set up a

909
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,399
generative model for each of these and

910
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,720
you would have for instance a

911
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
given kind of uh you know

912
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
matrix to describe the perception like

913
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
given a given set of

914
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
observations what's the state that you

915
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,279
then infer and so

916
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
this could be like some aspects of like

917
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,320
so what is an

918
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,120
agent what is a person uh noticing in

919
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,720
different circumstances and so this is

920
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,039
like

921
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,360
what is what is it in particular that is

922
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,559
entering into their experience where

923
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
does their attention go

924
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
you could also have like their attention

925
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,720
not just in terms of a sort of like

926
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,760
uh a salience but a kind of like

927
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,880
active curiosity and a a sampling from

928
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,279
the environment is a kind of mental act

929
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,880
and so this then will influence like

930
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
what's getting fed into the stream of

931
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
experience and

932
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
what it's like to be a particular kind

933
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,600
of agent

934
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,360
kind of particular kind of person in a

935
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,519
particular kind of situation

936
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,519
um those are some thoughts

937
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,559
cool we'll return to that idea about

938
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,600
being in the

939
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
niche for a particular kind of agent

940
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
we'll do sasha and then call in with the

941
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,320
last word on the intro

942
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,840
awesome yeah thank you um really great

943
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
conversation i've already reduced my

944
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,000
uncertainty

945
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,840
and a lot of the questions i came in

946
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,200
with um

947
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
uh thank you colin for explaining that

948
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,760
behavior is not the same thing as

949
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
personality

950
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,240
because that's something i was starting

951
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,919
to wonder

952
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,360
so it's yeah relevant that personality

953
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,120
uh contains as part of it the

954
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
self-report of the

955
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,679
um individual's experience um

956
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,000
and then i like what you said about your

957
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,679
most recent work that sounds really

958
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
interesting and kind of falls in line

959
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,120
with

960
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,159
active inference uh

961
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
as reducing uncertainty about our

962
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,919
environment and so it seems that

963
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,799
uh extroverts and introverts have a

964
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,840
different sensitivity to

965
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,040
um sense sensitivity to precision

966
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,000
about their world where extroverts are

967
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,399
more

968
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,079
sensitive to reward and

969
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,639
updating their generative model from the

970
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,760
external inputs

971
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,719
like mainly i'm thinking social but of

972
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
course could be other things

973
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,520
um so that's an interesting how it fits

974
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,879
into this model

975
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,918
of active inference as well and um i

976
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,879
guess my last thought

977
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,320
is is there another level up

978
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,159
um here where we can talk about people

979
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,480
who

980
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,679
are also sensitive to precision

981
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
about personality tests and others

982
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
quantified self

983
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
um whether there's a metric for that

984
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,359
kind of like self-reflection

985
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,960
part of it um and if that

986
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
i think sometimes that can seem a bit

987
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,560
like

988
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,200
a self-fulfilling prophecy but like i

989
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,720
know i'm the kind of person who does

990
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,520
this

991
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,599
so i expect this personality test to

992
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,720
tell me this

993
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
um where you're actually not sensitive

994
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,760
to

995
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,320
new information you just want a kind of

996
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
confirmation

997
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,960
on what you already think so oh yeah

998
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,520
okay interesting stuff colin and then

999
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
we're gonna move to the next section

1000
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
okay so quickly then just a couple of

1001
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
thoughts on the last

1002
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
couple of comments um so first of all

1003
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you raise something sasha that is

1004
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
important which is that personality

1005
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,400
tests are certainly

1006
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
fallible right they're not a great form

1007
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
of measurement they're just the best

1008
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,920
form of measurement we have for

1009
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
assessing people's personalities

1010
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
and the reason for that is that it's

1011
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,440
really hard to get at an assessment of

1012
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,359
people's persistent patterns

1013
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,160
in all of their you know different

1014
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
aspects of functioning

1015
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,480
uh with anything other than relying on

1016
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,920
people to tell you about it right you

1017
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,119
could try to come up with

1018
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
you know like some complex set of tasks

1019
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,640
and people come into the lab and do all

1020
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
these things and you videotape them and

1021
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
somehow that's gonna you're gonna

1022
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
extract all the information about their

1023
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,480
personality from that by a carefully

1024
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,760
chosen set of things that you have them

1025
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,640
go through

1026
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,000
you know it'd be a huge amount of work

1027
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,359
and you'd be learning less about what

1028
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,800
they're like in general than just asking

1029
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
them a bunch of questions

1030
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,240
so you know this is always a perennial

1031
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
problem it's like well there are these

1032
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,720
difficulties with self-reports people

1033
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,599
have biases

1034
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,400
they uh you know they are motivated to

1035
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,839
think of themselves as being

1036
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,760
more desirable in various ways than they

1037
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
are from a you know social desirability

1038
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,480
perspective

1039
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,160
uh and so what what can you do about

1040
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,520
that and

1041
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
yeah there are certainly studies of you

1042
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
know the degree to which people are

1043
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
accurate in their personality assessment

1044
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
and like the degree to which if they

1045
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,119
assess their own personality how much

1046
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,400
does that agree with other people's

1047
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
assessments of their personality

1048
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
and larger discrepancies can be

1049
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
predictive of things sometimes

1050
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
of psychological problems um so there's

1051
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
a you know there's a whole

1052
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,760
area of studying that um but i think i

1053
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,640
like this idea of

1054
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
people who have curiosity about their

1055
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
own personalities

1056
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,079
and that kind of leads into something i

1057
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,119
just wanted to say generally about

1058
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,400
personality which is that

1059
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,480
definitely extroversion is related to

1060
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
this kind of curiosity about things that

1061
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,560
are potentially

1062
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,240
rewarding but if we think about

1063
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
curiosity more generally

1064
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,920
as a sensitivity to the reward value of

1065
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
information per se

1066
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,359
so just essentially the motivation to

1067
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,720
improve the quality of our

1068
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
interpretations of the world in terms of

1069
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,839
that

1070
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,520
language of interpretations and goals

1071
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,359
and strategies then

1072
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,920
we have a there's a pretty clear sense

1073
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,400
that

1074
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,560
curiosity of that sort of general form

1075
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
is the core of one of the big five

1076
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,160
traits so the openness to experience an

1077
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,400
intellect dimension of the big five

1078
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,599
is really focused on people's curiosity

1079
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,920
and hunger for information essentially

1080
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
whether that be more about aesthetic and

1081
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,560
perceptual

1082
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,079
information related to openness to

1083
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,839
experience or whether it's

1084
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,079
related to abstract information related

1085
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,520
to intellectual

1086
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
issues so that that seems to be one of

1087
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
the really core dimensions of

1088
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,520
people's personalities so i do think

1089
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,359
there's a there's a very clear way to

1090
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,359
connect that into this idea of

1091
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,160
you know foraging for uh for information

1092
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,560
and

1093
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
seeking out increased entropy for the

1094
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,160
sake of reducing entropy

1095
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
uh over time you know which is what

1096
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,599
learning is essentially

1097
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,680
so there are good connections there

1098
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
definitely

1099
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,599
interesting and adam just one quick last

1100
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,880
note

1101
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,200
uh so yeah quickly um

1102
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
as before we temporarily close off the

1103
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
phenomenology thread

1104
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,760
um it seems like there's a really uh

1105
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,680
rich kind of bi-directional relationship

1106
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,640
between uh personality science and

1107
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
active inference

1108
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,240
and that uh with personality science you

1109
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
actually have this

1110
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,040
like like they're all basically these

1111
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,880
um from the personality modelers i met

1112
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,320
they're all these very like integrative

1113
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,160
generalists approaching this hair ball

1114
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
of a problem from as many ways as they

1115
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,480
can

1116
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
and basically bootstrapping themselves

1117
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
to validity and reliability

1118
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,920
and so they've come up with a really

1119
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
rich literature of

1120
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,800
phenomena to populate the phenomenology

1121
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,480
and active inference provides the sort

1122
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,920
of like places where

1123
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,800
you want to kind of dig in deeper onto

1124
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
like well what is the exact like

1125
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,000
causal mechanism it's like cybernetic

1126
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,200
big five theory was probably the like

1127
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,720
best um in personality science of

1128
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
getting a causal processes of like how

1129
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,119
you're uh

1130
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,960
where are these traits coming from and

1131
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,480
what are they actually doing for the

1132
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,280
agent

1133
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,440
so now you can bring an active inference

1134
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,880
and describe

1135
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
agents of cybernetic systems run

1136
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,079
simulations

1137
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,079
uh generate things that would correspond

1138
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,520
to different aspects of

1139
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,480
personality like for instance the

1140
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
dopamine system and curiosity

1141
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,920
you now can modify your parameter over

1142
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,119
policy selection

1143
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,040
and see what then unfolds with respect

1144
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,280
to both overt acts or

1145
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,640
mental acts like attentional shifts um

1146
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
so there's just one final thing before

1147
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
you go the next part is

1148
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,119
uh there's some uh in the paper

1149
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,200
we start to talk about this idea of like

1150
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,480
a piece truck

1151
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,359
um or like this kind of object that

1152
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,240
could be used

1153
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,079
in something like compute computational

1154
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,599
psychiatry for

1155
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,480
um kind of pooling data over multiple

1156
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,319
multiple people to like come up with

1157
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,960
um basically a general personality model

1158
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
that you can deploy

1159
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,760
for different agents um

1160
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
we might want to go into the weeds on

1161
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,359
that later um to the extent we can but

1162
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,160
the

1163
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,720
thing i want to get is that uh the one

1164
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
thing to model an active inference

1165
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,079
is we are all personality modelers

1166
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,000
it's like we are all necessarily like

1167
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,599
super forecasters trying to predict the

1168
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,560
future

1169
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,400
we are all also personality modelers

1170
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,200
trying to predict each other

1171
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,240
and ourselves and part of this would be

1172
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
towards us and well what kind of agent

1173
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
do i think i am

1174
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,520
what do i think my personality is like

1175
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
what do i think is going to be

1176
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,680
either more situation like what's going

1177
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,960
to be enduring

1178
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
uh what's going to be you can have

1179
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,640
personality be enduring but

1180
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,200
variable so what's going to be uh how

1181
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,079
variable are these

1182
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,839
aspects of me how likely are they to

1183
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,680
endure these are the questions you have

1184
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,280
to ask of yourself and other agents in

1185
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
order to

1186
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,319
govern the interactions and the best of

1187
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,400
your ability well said

1188
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,760
adam it really just highlights how much

1189
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
people even though we say things like

1190
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,640
well we don't know even given someone's

1191
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,760
personality we don't know what they're

1192
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,800
gonna do it's like

1193
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,400
yeah but you know what language they're

1194
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,079
gonna speak and so in the broad scheme

1195
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,440
of things you've actually reduced your

1196
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
uncertainty quite a lot

1197
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,160
and if you're not 99.9 aligned with that

1198
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,359
agent who's like you

1199
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,960
in the niche sharing an interface with

1200
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
you that

1201
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,440
conflict or adversarial relationship or

1202
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:43,839
just

1203
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,560
risk surface is going to spiral and so

1204
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,400
it's all about this interface yeah marco

1205
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
if you want to go ahead

1206
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,880
yeah thanks i'm sorry i didn't get get

1207
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,000
the fire on the paper but that was

1208
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,200
really interesting i just briefly

1209
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,920
skimmed

1210
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
the section on it so so it sounds like

1211
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,040
the p structure is

1212
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,440
basically allowing for a heuristic

1213
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,520
contextual dependency

1214
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,839
so they have the generic genetic models

1215
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,040
of your being

1216
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,440
and the p structure kind of links the

1217
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
current context

1218
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,040
to the generic uh kind of models and

1219
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,000
that allows for the

1220
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
variation over different situations i

1221
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,079
mean and emphasizing the heuristic

1222
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,119
nature of it

1223
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,599
because personality basically can be

1224
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,960
seen as a very useful

1225
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
heuristic for how to act in the world

1226
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,079
does that make sense or should i

1227
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
just read more in the paper no i think

1228
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,200
that's really

1229
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,920
a great uh connection there and a setup

1230
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
i think in figure two or when we see the

1231
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,520
graphical model maybe let's think about

1232
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
where the structure would play in

1233
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
and then emphasize its role as a

1234
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
statistical construct that reduces our

1235
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,480
uncertainty about regularities in the

1236
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,200
world

1237
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,319
just like every other kind of

1238
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,240
statistical modeling framework

1239
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,680
does um and then i think we'll be able

1240
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
to come back to that p-struct question

1241
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,720
but what a fun uh warm-up

1242
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,240
section good times so in

1243
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
today we did the introductions and

1244
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,520
warm-up and then

1245
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,440
we'll have the sections of this paper

1246
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
which may be if you're listening you've

1247
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,480
read or not

1248
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
and that is the integrating cybernetic

1249
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,839
big five theory with free energy

1250
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,839
principle a new strategy for modeling

1251
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,920
personalities as complex systems

1252
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,240
by saffron and young both of whom are on

1253
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,520
this call

1254
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,720
so in this set of slides we do have

1255
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,839
a bunch of uh the abstract roadmap some

1256
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,280
other stuff but i think there are so

1257
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,640
many interesting threads we've

1258
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,200
raised let's just try to walk through

1259
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,079
all of them

1260
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,119
um in no specific order but really think

1261
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,400
about what topics do we want to

1262
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,280
highlight

1263
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,440
for next week when we talk about the

1264
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
same paper

1265
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,040
and how will we get deeper into some of

1266
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,720
these threads that we've raised today in

1267
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,000
the discussion

1268
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,079
so here's the aims and claims slide and

1269
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,280
adam or

1270
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,319
colin um what

1271
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,880
was just your intention with the paper

1272
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
and after

1273
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,960
doing it where do you see the next

1274
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,880
implications of the paper or the next

1275
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,240
research directions for

1276
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,760
what you kind of want to do in that

1277
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
direction and if that verges into some

1278
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,560
of the figures just

1279
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,839
mention it and i'll go to that figure

1280
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,920
um well i think that our basic

1281
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,680
motivation for doing it was just that we

1282
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
had already been talking together about

1283
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,160
topics of mutual interest and the

1284
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,920
opportunity to write this chapter came

1285
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,119
up and i thought oh this would be a

1286
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,160
really fun thing to

1287
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,240
uh a good excuse to do something with

1288
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,520
adam and kind of get our thoughts

1289
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,400
together and

1290
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,560
you know actually uh written down and

1291
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
out there in the world

1292
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
um and so you know i think

1293
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,800
he and i probably have slightly

1294
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
different incentives for where this is

1295
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,839
going next

1296
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,760
um he's more interested in the process

1297
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,720
processes of modeling whereas i'm more

1298
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,359
interested

1299
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
in you know generating knowledge about

1300
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,079
the specific mechanisms and uh you know

1301
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
brain processes that underlie different

1302
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,680
personality traits and risks for

1303
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,200
different types of psychopathology that

1304
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,599
are tied to different personality traits

1305
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,280
um but um yeah i think i mean to me this

1306
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
is just a really nice way to kind of

1307
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,760
connect

1308
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,839
um my thinking about personality with

1309
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,800
this uh

1310
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,640
what seems to me to be an a really

1311
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,040
generative perspective with the whole uh

1312
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
fep framework and what's happening with

1313
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,119
that in science in general

1314
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,640
i'm sure adam has some other thoughts

1315
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,800
about that too

1316
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,560
yeah go for it adam but that was very

1317
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,920
interesting colin thanks

1318
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,480
oh i mean for me that was primarily the

1319
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,280
thing like

1320
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440
colin and i were already kind of going

1321
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,800
into the weeds together and

1322
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
having fun with it and so it's then uh

1323
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,760
basically uh iarpa brought together this

1324
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,599
meeting of personality modelers

1325
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,640
to create this book modeling persons and

1326
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,920
situations

1327
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,440
um basically seeing that the extent

1328
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
which personality science could do

1329
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,520
uh predictive modeling of agents um

1330
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,200
basically they want to recapitulate the

1331
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,079
plot of westworld as far as i can tell

1332
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,200
um so i'm actually not joking

1333
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,319
uh but except i am uh but yeah this is

1334
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,119
my primarily

1335
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,480
uh uh interest

1336
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
would be just uh what the heck are

1337
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,160
persons uh

1338
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,079
and uh what can they be and how can we

1339
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,200
understand them

1340
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,240
and uh who am i and what do i want

1341
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
yeah and also one thing we haven't

1342
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,520
raised is

1343
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
who or what is a person there's

1344
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
personality as being the statistical

1345
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,240
regularities of

1346
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,599
agent in niche so that's just uh

1347
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,520
like a person in an exoskeleton you

1348
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,800
could have some sort of model for that

1349
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,680
or a person with

1350
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,200
other types of constraints on or

1351
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
something like that but

1352
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
then there's the idea of like what is a

1353
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
person legally what is a person

1354
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,920
culturally and

1355
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,240
all these ideas are coming into play

1356
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,520
with modeling

1357
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,359
legal persons and physical persons and

1358
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,040
regular statistical regularities that

1359
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
include our digital affordances

1360
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,560
all of that is becoming integrated our

1361
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,400
digital persona is that

1362
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,359
included in these uh emotive models

1363
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,800
there's just a lot of really interesting

1364
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,520
stuff to

1365
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,400
think about there so then just copied on

1366
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
the screen for

1367
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,599
people who are looking is that abstract

1368
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,800
you can pause the video

1369
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,839
there and here is the roadmap then we'll

1370
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,119
have the figures and then there's

1371
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,960
just one kind of interesting general

1372
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,560
question from an audience

1373
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,760
but in the roadmap just if you have any

1374
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,960
thoughts on

1375
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,520
the layout or the authors could give a

1376
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,040
point if they wanted to about

1377
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,480
why they arranged it the way they

1378
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,800
arranged it or which parts they

1379
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,480
thought were important if somebody was

1380
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
just going to read one section or

1381
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,079
any thoughts on that otherwise we can

1382
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,160
just go to the figures but okay

1383
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,359
let me know if you want to return to

1384
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,839
this otherwise it's just the headers of

1385
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,040
the paper

1386
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,839
all right so here's figure one and colin

1387
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,520
this really returns to your point from

1388
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
earlier about the graphical models what

1389
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:49,760
do

1390
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,520
connections in graphical models

1391
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,359
represent and that's

1392
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,119
very related to a general question of

1393
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,559
like what do variables

1394
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,720
represent principal component one what

1395
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,400
does that represent what english word

1396
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,520
are we gonna put on that

1397
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,160
you know mx plus b linear model what are

1398
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,880
we gonna call

1399
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,800
x what is the slope what is that going

1400
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,640
to be called and then how does that play

1401
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,480
out graphically whether in an equation

1402
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,599
or whether in a

1403
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,760
drawing like this so i would love to

1404
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
hear your thoughts and then

1405
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,319
anyone else can raise their hand on this

1406
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,960
one okay so i made the basic distinction

1407
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,240
earlier between a

1408
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,119
uh a statistical model of covariance

1409
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,200
like a structural equation model

1410
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,720
i think it's really important not to

1411
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,480
call structural equation models causal

1412
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,000
models because they're not

1413
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,520
that drives me crazy when people refer

1414
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,880
to causal modeling and all they're doing

1415
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
is a set of regression pads

1416
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,040
right what that is fundamentally is uh

1417
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,400
trying to

1418
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,040
you know recreate patterns of covariance

1419
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,319
in data

1420
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,960
and if you have special kinds of data

1421
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,000
like with temporal

1422
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,760
priority or where some variable has

1423
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,599
actually been manipulated

1424
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,720
then you actually interpret you know

1425
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,319
causal

1426
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,599
effects from covariance structure

1427
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,680
but uh just in and of itself there's

1428
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,359
nothing inherently causal about

1429
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,800
structural equation modeling or

1430
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,720
regression

1431
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,480
this model here however is different

1432
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,480
this is actually intended as a

1433
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,280
conceptual

1434
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,680
causal model so these are not just

1435
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,319
looking at

1436
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,160
correlations between different variables

1437
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,359
in a population

1438
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,200
this is thinking about the actual causal

1439
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,000
processes that produce the functions of

1440
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,480
an

1441
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,040
individual agent specifically a human

1442
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,800
being

1443
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,559
and so what this is this is just sort of

1444
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,880
like a way to encapsulate an overview of

1445
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,599
the way that

1446
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,040
my theory uh defines personality traits

1447
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,960
and characteristic adaptations which are

1448
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,640
the two elements of

1449
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,240
exhaustive elements of personality uh in

1450
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,359
the theory and so the idea is that

1451
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,559
you know we know from decades of

1452
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,160
research that both genetics and the

1453
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,079
environment contribute to

1454
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,599
people's personality traits and the

1455
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,720
uh idea is that

1456
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,400
personality traits are patterns of

1457
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,839
behavior that's why they have their own

1458
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,680
separate box there there's sometimes a

1459
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,280
tendency in personality psychology to

1460
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,880
say well what the trait really is is

1461
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,480
some underlying thing that causes

1462
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
people's behavior

1463
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,079
but i think that that leads to confusion

1464
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,680
because what we actually measure when we

1465
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,280
measure personality traits is a

1466
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,079
description

1467
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,160
of regularities in the person's behavior

1468
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,520
and experience

1469
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,040
so i think it's important to keep that

1470
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,559
clear but then

1471
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,640
the the middle box there are the

1472
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,160
relatively stable parameters of

1473
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,599
cybernetic mechanisms

1474
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,280
is trying to say something about where

1475
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
those patterns of regularity come from

1476
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
and so the personality traits are not

1477
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,559
some underlying causal process that

1478
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,720
generates personality they are just

1479
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,040
patterns now they themselves do have

1480
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,480
downstream causal effects however

1481
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,000
because let's say i'm the kind of person

1482
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,319
who talks all the time well that's going

1483
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,400
to have consequences on the world around

1484
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,440
me right and that

1485
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,359
will make me lead me to develop

1486
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,440
different patterns of adaptation to my

1487
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,880
environment to have different outcomes

1488
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,559
on the people around me

1489
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,079
it's going to lead to different outcomes

1490
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
and different adaptations so that's the

1491
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,240
final

1492
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,520
box there um and then they're just you

1493
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,200
know there's identification of feedback

1494
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,480
loops here so the

1495
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,200
idea that you're generally speaking the

1496
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,480
flow is that your

1497
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
basic personality traits caused by these

1498
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,720
basic settings of parameters that have a

1499
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,640
strong genetic component to them

1500
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
influence how we adapt and how we do you

1501
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,720
know what we pick up on and what habits

1502
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,200
we develop in any particular situations

1503
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
uh habits is a good synonym for

1504
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,040
characteristic adaptations

1505
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,400
but sometimes there can actually be

1506
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
feedback so let's say for example

1507
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
that i'm an introvert but for whatever

1508
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,119
reason i get into a job that has a

1509
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,960
an important component is selling things

1510
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
right i get into sales somehow

1511
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,559
so i'm going to have to develop at least

1512
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,559
in that context the ability to act like

1513
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,680
an extrovert if i'm going to be

1514
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,119
successful in my job

1515
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,559
and maybe i get good at that right so

1516
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,400
i've got a characteristic adaptation to

1517
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,079
my particular niche which is that at

1518
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,520
least in this context

1519
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,800
i'm good at acting like an extrovert but

1520
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,000
this acknowledges that there's a

1521
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,680
possibility for that to feed back and

1522
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,760
actually make me more sensitive to

1523
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,680
incentive rewards in general

1524
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,200
and so i may actually find that i'm not

1525
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,440
just more extroverted in this particular

1526
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,400
job context

1527
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,000
after five years of doing this maybe i'm

1528
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,920
more extroverted in my life as a whole

1529
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,680
in all these other contexts

1530
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,280
um so that's the the one of those

1531
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,520
feedback loops and then so you see that

1532
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,160
there's a

1533
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
the environment can directly affect the

1534
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,839
kind of ways in which we adapt to our

1535
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,040
environment obviously

1536
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,960
but the environment but genetics

1537
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,720
any effective genetics on our specific

1538
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,480
adaptations must feed through the

1539
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,240
effects of genetics on these general

1540
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,680
mechanisms these parameters that

1541
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,319
underlie

1542
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,839
our functioning and so you know if

1543
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,599
anybody has any other questions about

1544
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,319
that

1545
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,079
diagram i'm happy to respond

1546
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,200
that was a great explanation and just to

1547
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,280
um emphasize one point there and then

1548
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,319
we'll go to stephen

1549
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,599
you said that the characteristic

1550
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,520
adaptations and life outcomes are

1551
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,640
exhaustive and so um that really is like

1552
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
we can partition them into the

1553
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,520
adaptations or the things that the agent

1554
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,480
carries with them

1555
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,319
the synapses that have changed or the

1556
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,559
scars they bear but basically what

1557
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,319
is not their surrounding and the life

1558
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,760
outcome is the niche

1559
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,000
so then there's this stigma g where the

1560
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
agent is doing niche construction so

1561
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,200
this is from a different

1562
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,720
non-active inference non-niche

1563
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,960
construction framework but finding

1564
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,599
resonances and finding concordances here

1565
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,000
because

1566
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,200
that's kind of what we talk about like

1567
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,480
the learning of agents and then the way

1568
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,160
that influences their niche

1569
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,079
and then you had this idea of acting as

1570
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,839
if like the example with the person

1571
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,319
who's

1572
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,720
um being forced by their niche to

1573
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,520
implement

1574
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,160
uh i'm a kind of person who says hello

1575
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,119
in this way or

1576
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,880
things like that and then that also

1577
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,319
relates to what stephen

1578
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,880
was saying earlier about drama and about

1579
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,000
performance

1580
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,359
so maybe stephen do you have a thought

1581
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,680
on that

1582
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,559
yeah i mean the the the thing i like

1583
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,920
about what was mentioned here is how

1584
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
personality traits

1585
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,079
can be adapted

1586
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,480
to context like someone's a salesperson

1587
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,559
that was a useful example

1588
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,119
and then how that obviously starts to

1589
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
then change your whole

1590
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,720
broader way of seeing things and

1591
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
one area i think might be interesting

1592
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,559
and i've been there's the work of harry

1593
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,319
hest who's revisiting this

1594
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,599
the work of roger barker from the 60s

1595
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,200
we did a lot of work on behavior

1596
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,119
settings so he looked a whole lot of

1597
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,880
children across the us and

1598
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,720
he looked at how their behavior was when

1599
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,480
they were in a school or in the cafe or

1600
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
different places he found the difference

1601
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,000
in behavior

1602
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,400
between settings for the same child was

1603
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,079
bigger than the difference in behavior

1604
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:28,960
between

1605
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,680
personalities of children ie the same

1606
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,800
child

1607
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,040
was changing his behavior radically

1608
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
based on the settings

1609
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,799
and that that work kind of got lost but

1610
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,480
harry heft has sort of

1611
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,720
been really pushing that again i i think

1612
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,960
that can tie into this is maybe this

1613
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,200
personality traits

1614
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,799
are i suppose you know how much

1615
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,240
stability there is but

1616
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,559
could behavior settings be kind of like

1617
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,400
that kind of more dynamic version of

1618
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
personality traits and i think active

1619
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,599
inference

1620
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,680
it makes that more possible to even have

1621
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,880
that conversation

1622
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,880
rather than the more sort of static

1623
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,480
psychometric

1624
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,359
data which is kind of top down and kind

1625
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,240
of

1626
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,160
you just have to accept it feels like

1627
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,079
this is mo you can get in there and play

1628
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,200
with it a bit more

1629
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,400
from different directions thanks for

1630
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,680
sharing that stephen we'll go

1631
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,599
collin and then anyone else who raises

1632
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,799
their hands

1633
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,799
yeah so that's a really a really good

1634
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,640
point steven which is that

1635
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,599
uh there is there are differences that

1636
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,760
people have to specific situations

1637
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
that are distinct from their broad

1638
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,160
patterns of consistency and personality

1639
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,760
and that's a long-running debate in

1640
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,240
personality psychology going back to the

1641
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,599
to the late 60s and the resolution to it

1642
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,520
basically is that yes there are these

1643
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,200
relatively stable ways in which people

1644
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,359
respond to specific situations

1645
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,559
and that's what i'm trying to capture

1646
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:51,680
with the idea of characteristic

1647
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,720
adaptations

1648
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,480
but then if you go across a bunch of

1649
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,559
character a bunch of situations

1650
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,319
and you take the person's average there

1651
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,480
are also persistent averages that differ

1652
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,680
from person to person

1653
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,440
and that would correspond to the trait

1654
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,040
so you can have both of these things in

1655
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,520
the same set of data

1656
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,319
and will fleeson is a personality

1657
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,599
psychologist who's really been

1658
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,200
instrumental in

1659
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,000
collecting the data to show this very

1660
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,079
basic feature of what are we measuring

1661
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,440
when we measure a personality trait with

1662
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,480
something like a questionnaire where

1663
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,920
we're just asking somebody for this sort

1664
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,079
of general impression of themselves

1665
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,640
and so what he's done is used experience

1666
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,680
sampling methods where

1667
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,760
like you have somebody's smartphone and

1668
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,040
it you know pings them

1669
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,280
like five times a day and asks them like

1670
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,960
how have you been acting for the last

1671
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,920
you know half an hour

1672
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,839
for the last hour and then you get them

1673
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,520
to rate their behavior on a set of

1674
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,280
uh you know on a set of descriptions or

1675
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,960
categories

1676
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,079
what you see is that uh as you said

1677
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,760
people have as much or even more

1678
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,599
variability within their own behavior as

1679
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,280
there is variability in terms of their

1680
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,760
average behavior from person to person

1681
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
and yet nonetheless those averages are

1682
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,839
quite stable so if you do this for one

1683
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:58,400
week

1684
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,160
you can get a whole you'll get a he

1685
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,839
calls them density distributions right

1686
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,440
you basically just get uh

1687
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,040
you know and they're usually fairly

1688
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,200
normally shaped um

1689
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
and you do that for one week you get

1690
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,480
this whole pattern so sometimes the

1691
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,920
person's acting very introverted

1692
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,040
sometimes they're acting very

1693
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,720
extroverted you know it ranges

1694
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,760
um but there's there's a peak

1695
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,000
and that peak is very stable if you do

1696
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,960
it again

1697
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
in another week so the person goes

1698
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,079
through another week of behavior and

1699
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,280
again they're

1700
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,280
varying very widely in their behavior

1701
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,119
but if you look at their average level

1702
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,880
of that particular behavior

1703
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,920
it's quite stable uh over time and so

1704
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,200
and then he's also shown that that

1705
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,440
correlates quite highly with the

1706
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,520
ratings that we get from these general

1707
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,960
personality questionnaires

1708
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,040
so the questionnaires really are tapping

1709
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,559
into this sort of general average

1710
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,240
tendency of specific behavior

1711
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,760
even though of course the behavior

1712
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,839
itself varies widely from situation to

1713
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,520
situation and over time

1714
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
both due to situational affordances and

1715
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,839
due to whatever is going on internally

1716
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,119
in terms of the goals that the person is

1717
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,440
pursuing at that moment

1718
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,680
awesome let's go marco then adam

1719
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,040
yeah thanks it was actually really

1720
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,200
interesting i apologize i'm gonna

1721
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,880
add another interesting thing to connect

1722
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,640
to so so someone mentioned

1723
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,640
steven mentioned the uh the kids in the

1724
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,319
classrooms and the context and i think

1725
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,440
development might be also very

1726
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,640
interesting here

1727
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,960
because um personality might be

1728
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,720
relatively stable across a lifetime but

1729
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,359
but i think

1730
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,359
hopefully we can agree that personality

1731
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,720
also enriches

1732
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,680
um and in in that process of enrichments

1733
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,760
and i would also say empowerment

1734
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,240
um there's i think you could say a shift

1735
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,040
between the

1736
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,280
balance of endogenous and exogenous

1737
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,319
influence on

1738
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,119
an agent's behavioral adaptation or to

1739
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:39,440
its

1740
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,559
to its niches um and so there's a

1741
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,160
there's a change in the scope

1742
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,119
in which the personality uh has a

1743
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,960
relatively large influence on the way

1744
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,000
they

1745
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
adapt and i guess i'm just asking

1746
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,920
about thoughts on how you might picture

1747
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,240
that kind of process of how

1748
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,440
personality might actually in the

1749
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,319
beginning largely concern yourself with

1750
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,079
how to engage with the world such that

1751
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,359
it might

1752
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,960
internalize that which it normally

1753
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,119
co-ops from the environment so normally

1754
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,640
you offload a lot of stuff

1755
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,000
to behaviorally adapt which might

1756
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,359
explain the variation due to environment

1757
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,040
but then over time as it does so it

1758
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,280
internalizes certain heuristics certain

1759
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,799
patterns certain policies

1760
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,400
and learn from environments to kind of

1761
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,160
enrich its personality

1762
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,440
and then extend the scope

1763
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,400
of influence from their personality um

1764
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,680
yeah i don't know if that makes sense

1765
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,160
but

1766
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
yeah cool thought yeah adam and then

1767
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,640
anywhere else

1768
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,359
uh so a few thoughts from before and

1769
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,000
then um

1770
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,200
some thoughts on marco's thoughts um so

1771
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
the fleece and description of uh

1772
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,319
personality

1773
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,599
as a kind of uh density uh distribution

1774
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,640
um i think and the issue of um the

1775
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,160
stability of personality and the

1776
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,319
variance of it

1777
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,520
with within individuals across context

1778
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,200
which is part of the reason the

1779
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,680
book that was this chapter was part of

1780
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,240
was called

1781
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,920
modeling persons and situations but uh

1782
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,160
taking these ideas together we're kind

1783
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,000
of in the same territory

1784
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
uh that of these fundamental questions

1785
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,680
in the free energy principle

1786
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,920
of like what is the ontological status

1787
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,720
of

1788
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,559
a non-equilibrium steady state

1789
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,119
distribution bounded by a markov blanket

1790
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:27,839
um

1791
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,000
what's the granularity over which we can

1792
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,960
find this

1793
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,599
this thing that we're identifying so

1794
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,799
it's

1795
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,000
you're uh and so

1796
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,920
um colin will be able to speak more to

1797
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,200
this but this idea of like

1798
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,400
there are ways of describing that

1799
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,720
your degree of variability across

1800
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,599
context

1801
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,720
is itself something that can be stable

1802
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,240
and this could be itself part of your

1803
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,760
personality um

1804
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,960
uh now kind of loop back uh to

1805
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,799
what you were just describing marco um

1806
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,240
i really like that idea um so it's like

1807
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,359
you're

1808
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,599
you're starting out in a situation

1809
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,559
where through this interaction between

1810
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,280
you

1811
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,480
and this context that you're

1812
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,480
entering into in certain ways based on

1813
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,760
your own expectations and the

1814
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,359
expectations of

1815
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,799
people in the environment and the

1816
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,720
structures that are there

1817
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,400
built up from this there's a certain

1818
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,839
stability

1819
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,799
and then you both you uh

1820
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,480
this stability um ends up shaping you um

1821
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,440
both just as a consequence of like this

1822
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,119
is the thing for you to predict

1823
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,960
but also in the active inferential sense

1824
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,720
and as you're saying empowerment

1825
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
this is what's going to help me get

1826
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,000
better purchase

1827
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,160
i'm reducing my uncertainty with respect

1828
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,720
to realizing the value of uh

1829
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,079
existing and so this um

1830
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,960
idea that your personality being kind of

1831
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,960
um

1832
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,880
internalization of structure and maybe

1833
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,000
at a certain stage almost like a kind of

1834
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,680
amortized inference

1835
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,119
um in terms of uh which i got from you

1836
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,400
uh uh yeah i really like that idea a lot

1837
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,839
cool adam shannon

1838
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,440
you're a muted chin

1839
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,119
thank you um going on this developmental

1840
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,160
thread and um

1841
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,480
the paper that you brought up this

1842
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,599
morning daniel and

1843
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,640
um anna's new paper on the the first

1844
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,520
priors

1845
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,760
when you're in redo as a baby i haven't

1846
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,559
read it

1847
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
yet but um

1848
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,720
the idea that like when you're in a

1849
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,520
neonate

1850
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,359
in a body you're literally relying on

1851
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,359
someone else's

1852
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,359
interceptive states and biological

1853
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,960
states to regulate

1854
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,720
everything about your interceptive and

1855
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,400
biological states

1856
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,280
and then you're born and you're still

1857
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,160
kind of relying

1858
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,079
on the caregivers interceptive states or

1859
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,760
their behavior when they're holding you

1860
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,359
or coming to comfort you

1861
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,039
um this i think

1862
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,880
could relate to what marco was saying

1863
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,559
about how your personality

1864
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,920
develops so first if you have if a

1865
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,200
personality is something like a

1866
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,079
collection of

1867
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,760
effective states and behaviors and

1868
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,160
an infant is completely sort of reliant

1869
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,680
on the environment

1870
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,000
and the social environment to regulate

1871
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,799
its own

1872
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,400
personalities and as you grow through

1873
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,599
toddlerhood you slowly are able to

1874
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,000
control this yourself like you can

1875
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,839
maintain your own body budget a little

1876
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:46,720
bit more

1877
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,680
um learn how to how to get your own

1878
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,240
blanket if you're cold or

1879
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,280
like self-soothed and then you grow

1880
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,640
older and maybe you're taught how to

1881
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:56,960
make

1882
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,799
music and learning that this is a new

1883
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,240
way that you can

1884
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,520
explore your personality or create it

1885
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,480
um and

1886
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,359
i don't study development also sorry if

1887
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,319
this is

1888
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,480
wondering maybe sasha can pick up on it

1889
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,799
but i feel like this

1890
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,960
can kind of connect if instead of

1891
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,839
looking

1892
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,359
or not instead of but in addition to

1893
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,599
looking at averages but looking at like

1894
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,799
a time series

1895
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,000
of personality development over time and

1896
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,079
like you could do at any point in time

1897
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,680
at any range of time

1898
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,240
some sort of um like what would be that

1899
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,319
the active reference model of

1900
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,440
your life in infancy and toddlerhood

1901
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,480
in you know rowdy teenage years and as

1902
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,319
adult and you'll have

1903
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,240
you'll you'll find these like steady

1904
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,920
trajectories

1905
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,240
at the same time that was a bit rambling

1906
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:51,760
let me connect that to a few other

1907
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,000
points so adam raised this question of

1908
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,880
what is the level

1909
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,640
of the thing or how do we identify

1910
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,960
things from empirical

1911
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,720
data specifically so that we can use it

1912
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,640
in active inference type or free energy

1913
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,359
principle type

1914
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,520
models do we use renormalization group

1915
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,680
or principal component analysis or

1916
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,160
some type of adjacency matrix some type

1917
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,200
of markov blanket

1918
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,559
what are those things that we're

1919
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,319
actually going to be modeling

1920
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,000
and that reminds me a lot of a theory

1921
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,440
called a n t

1922
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,480
uh actor network theory by bruno latour

1923
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,880
and then also on the ant wavelength

1924
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,559
colin was mentioning how there's so much

1925
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,160
variation within

1926
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,880
individuals but also stable differences

1927
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,599
between

1928
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,079
and that reminded me a lot of my

1929
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:32,960
graduate school

1930
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,920
work with ant colonies where day to day

1931
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,200
the variation across

1932
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,440
all the ant colonies was extreme if it

1933
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,039
was raining they would do one thing if

1934
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,000
it was very dry

1935
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
versus if it had rain the day before

1936
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,480
those were massive determiners of colony

1937
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,200
behavior

1938
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,079
however across days and even across

1939
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,880
years

1940
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,559
there were stable markers of colony

1941
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,240
behavior and there were characteristic

1942
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,520
ways in which they responded

1943
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,240
to the environment so it is possible to

1944
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:58,640
have

1945
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
a type of measurement and understanding

1946
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,839
of a system

1947
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,559
which my advisor established through

1948
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,079
long-term observation

1949
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,079
where you can actually model this

1950
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,680
development through time

1951
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,599
as well as within a population which

1952
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,520
doesn't erase individual differences it

1953
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,880
actually is the framework

1954
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,200
by which individual differences arise

1955
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,880
and then change is so beautiful with

1956
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,960
music being introduced like a thread

1957
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,119
of personality and then that can be used

1958
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,960
to explore these regularities

1959
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:33,280
adam and then steven

1960
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,880
hi um what was the paper that people are

1961
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,359
mentioning uh about like first priors

1962
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,119
i'll post it in this jit scene we'll put

1963
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,200
it in the youtube chat but let's

1964
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,559
continue without worrying about this

1965
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,839
paper okay oh

1966
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,359
god oh sorry okay should i

1967
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,720
join it can i just i was just going to

1968
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,400
put in one thing

1969
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,599
just um because i like when it mentions

1970
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,680
here relatively stable parameters

1971
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,559
of cyber naked cybernetic mechanisms the

1972
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,280
sort of

1973
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,280
those kind of dynamics i think that

1974
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
links also to this idea of how that

1975
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,880
might change during our life

1976
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,920
and thinking about our lifetime and

1977
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,240
one thing that i'm very interested in is

1978
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,640
is when trauma comes into play

1979
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,760
ptsd and other types of situations and

1980
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,119
you know it's um it can really shift

1981
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,520
the state of someone and polyvagal

1982
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,359
theory kind of talks to that we've kind

1983
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,440
of got the sort of social

1984
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,480
co-regulation that we have as humans but

1985
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,720
we also have our kind of primal

1986
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,000
kind of fight or flight or our gut

1987
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,720
sort of sort of fear um responses

1988
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,839
and how those things

1989
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,240
are in a way another type of like

1990
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,440
pattern behavior which becomes

1991
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,720
incredibly

1992
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,200
stable too stable like you can shut down

1993
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,960
or you might get into rage

1994
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,000
but then over the period of the day or

1995
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,599
life the challenge is

1996
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,920
they may it may be unregulated about

1997
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,880
when they appear

1998
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,280
so someone might sort of be a certain

1999
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,440
way and then they flash into rage

2000
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,200
you know and then they come come back

2001
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,760
into and their personality is radically

2002
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,520
different and i think this

2003
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,319
is so they might be interesting to bring

2004
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:16,960
in that

2005
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,238
that that as a kind of a what happens

2006
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,479
when that relatively stable state

2007
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,158
itself flips you know so that the

2008
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,120
the and it might say your your mechanism

2009
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,759
might not be

2010
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,479
cognitive but it might be in that kind

2011
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,120
of

2012
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,479
polyvagal system yes the body

2013
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,319
influencing phase transitions in

2014
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,319
personality or behavior

2015
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,480
adam and then colin and then marca

2016
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,439
you're meeting that

2017
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,158
thanks um yes i think uh

2018
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,839
colin should probably speak to what was

2019
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,158
just brought up in terms of like

2020
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,120
what actually happens with people um but

2021
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,319
in terms of uh

2022
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,238
like a high level of abstraction um

2023
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,238
so yeah it seems like there's this sense

2024
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,640
in which you can think of personality

2025
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,238
as a kind of core screening but it's a

2026
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,359
kind of renormalization in terms of it

2027
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,279
existing as a phenomenon and it's a

2028
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,880
an epistemically it's a kind of core

2029
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,960
screening um afforded by this

2030
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,238
renormalization

2031
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,359
um this kind of throwing away a

2032
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,399
variability

2033
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,000
as you form these higher level

2034
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,439
attracting states

2035
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,000
um that you can ignore them

2036
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,520
within the scope of a certain type of

2037
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,359
modeling that you're engaging in

2038
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,479
with respect to having certain

2039
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,080
objectives of trying to predict certain

2040
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,120
things

2041
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,719
whether you're a personality modeler

2042
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,319
trying to predict someone else or

2043
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,920
trying to predict yourself or whatever

2044
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,600
um the so within this

2045
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,880
um looking for this like optimal

2046
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,719
level of epistemic grip in terms like

2047
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,040
the granularity of your description

2048
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,719
um this

2049
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,760
there you could describe these

2050
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,679
cybernetic control parameters as being

2051
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,920
uh part of the causal process of what's

2052
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,960
responsible

2053
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,880
and then if you take the system and you

2054
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
perturb it there's going to be like

2055
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
a range where like the order parameter

2056
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,239
changes you can get these

2057
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,800
non-linear maybe phase shifts where the

2058
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,280
um

2059
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,719
you're now in a different regime and it

2060
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,400
may look like a very different kind of

2061
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,360
person

2062
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,080
because the personality structure as

2063
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,480
this

2064
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,520
a stable attractor network um

2065
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,880
can then become destabilized um and

2066
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,080
so that would be like a high level and

2067
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,840
college probably speak to like what

2068
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,239
actually happens with people

2069
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,560
yeah call and go for it so you get these

2070
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
phase shifts in behavior but they're

2071
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,440
often due to persistent sensitivities

2072
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,760
in the underlying mechanisms right so

2073
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,719
let's take

2074
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,920
um also uh ptsd okay

2075
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,159
um what you have there essentially is

2076
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,080
some kind of traumatic event

2077
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,480
uh is an intervention that resets the

2078
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,040
sensitivity of the threat systems

2079
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,840
and so the that corresponds quite well

2080
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,719
to the

2081
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,080
big five dimension that's labeled as

2082
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,000
neuroticism which is an old-fashioned

2083
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,600
word but in this context basically just

2084
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,120
means sensitivity to all different kinds

2085
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,440
of negative emotion

2086
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,480
and so obviously that's heightened in

2087
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,480
ptsd and what that means fundamentally

2088
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,760
is that you've gone through some kind of

2089
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,199
traumatic event

2090
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,920
that led to your your it wasn't just

2091
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,520
learning about a specific event right

2092
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,440
what it did was that it reset the

2093
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,120
sensitivity of your threat system as a

2094
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:33,920
whole

2095
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,320
so now you are perceiving threats and

2096
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,199
reacting with

2097
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,320
defensive negative emotion to much more

2098
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,719
minor situations than you would have

2099
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,920
previously um and of course even in

2100
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,520
terms of risk for ptsd we know that

2101
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,560
people who are higher in

2102
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,320
threat sensitivity to begin with are

2103
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,239
more likely to develop ptsd so it's not

2104
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,159
like it comes out of nowhere typically

2105
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,840
but nonetheless it's obviously this

2106
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,320
change and there was a recent really

2107
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,760
nice meta-analysis

2108
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,480
of personality change following uh

2109
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,280
therapy

2110
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,199
and different types of psychotherapy

2111
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,880
whether it's pharmaceutical or talk

2112
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,600
therapy

2113
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,760
or cognitive behavioral therapy all of

2114
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,760
these lead to changes in personality and

2115
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,320
the

2116
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,760
the trait that changes the most as you

2117
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,440
might expect is reductions in

2118
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,880
neuroticism

2119
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,199
right so uh what we're talking about

2120
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,640
here is the ability to

2121
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,199
shift these underlying parameters that

2122
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,159
are not

2123
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,280
constantly manifest in the same way so

2124
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,480
when we say that somebody's high in

2125
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,239
trade anxiety for example we don't mean

2126
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,760
that they're experiencing anxiety at

2127
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,040
every minute of every day at a high

2128
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,159
level right we just

2129
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,600
mean that they're more likely to be

2130
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,600
anxious more intensely

2131
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,000
in more situations than somebody who is

2132
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,760
low in trade anxiety

2133
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,199
but nonetheless then if we really want

2134
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,840
to understand the dynamics of the system

2135
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,760
we need to understand those phase shifts

2136
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,600
from like feelings of safety to feelings

2137
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,520
of anxiety at any given moment and i

2138
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,440
that's what you're talking about but in

2139
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,280
order to understand how that works for a

2140
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,080
given agent

2141
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,280
we also need to understand these

2142
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,040
persistent patterns of the sensitivities

2143
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,800
that lead them to have these shifts

2144
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,400
in different situations into different

2145
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,840
degrees than other asians

2146
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,400
very cool thank you marco then blue

2147
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,760
thanks um yeah this is really

2148
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,159
interesting so um

2149
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,120
trying to tie back to the earlier talk

2150
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,480
about um

2151
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,800
the role of affects to this aspect of

2152
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,480
trauma so i think it's mentioned before

2153
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,199
by the two authors that that

2154
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,239
we could validly see these complex

2155
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,400
systems as composed of

2156
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,960
a different micro personalities

2157
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,040
distributed over scale and levels

2158
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,400
um and virus and similarly for affect

2159
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,960
in the sense written about uh by cost

2160
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,640
per husband and others

2161
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,080
so um adam saffron adam also

2162
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,400
mentioned renormalization right so so i

2163
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,159
think that ties in also to

2164
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,679
a lot of different things like stigma g

2165
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,840
or equilibration and i think perhaps

2166
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,600
it's i had a thought i wanted to share

2167
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,360
is maybe maybe

2168
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,520
um the clustering phenomenon of

2169
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,440
personalities might be

2170
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,440
a natural consequence of something like

2171
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,040
renormalization or

2172
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,880
equilibration if there already is a

2173
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,080
certain heterogeneity

2174
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,360
if there already is a certain kind of

2175
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,520
asymmetry in certain

2176
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,239
factors certain basic mechanisms of the

2177
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,840
cybernetic

2178
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,560
systems to shoot it throughout then that

2179
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,760
naturally should cluster

2180
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,679
because then they are more likely to

2181
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,600
cooperate if it remains

2182
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,840
heterogeneous and disordered or not

2183
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,760
co-organized then it's inefficient but

2184
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,360
then you have this thing with trauma

2185
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,760
which i think would disrupt that process

2186
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,480
right because

2187
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,080
if you go back to the components you

2188
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,000
pointed out interpretation

2189
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,360
goals and strategy then that's basically

2190
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,719
the key things about a trauma right

2191
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:43,840
you're understood in a situation that

2192
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,520
just demands an extreme

2193
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,320
change in your interpretational beliefs

2194
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,280
or models

2195
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,280
your goals for a particular situation

2196
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,320
and the

2197
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,080
extreme pressure to have the right

2198
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,679
strategy to get out of it

2199
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,719
and i think maybe the the the the side

2200
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,000
effect right the byproduct

2201
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,360
of that momentary extremeness is that it

2202
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,520
basically expands its influence

2203
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,760
and so it becomes hypersensitive by

2204
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,360
nature and so

2205
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,400
the ongoing the always ongoing process

2206
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,560
of equilibration of everything

2207
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,920
co-regulating

2208
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,920
uh becomes disrupted by that one

2209
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,960
participant

2210
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,159
the traumatic complex um if that makes

2211
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,719
sense so instead of a lot of different

2212
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,159
personalities kind of equilibrating with

2213
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,120
each other

2214
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,480
kind of polycentrically it becomes a

2215
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,040
monocentric equilibration

2216
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,320
if that makes sense it's a bit rambly

2217
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,400
lots of very interesting points thank

2218
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,000
you blue and then adam

2219
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,480
so just to kind of take the trauma

2220
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,080
aspect maybe to the

2221
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,640
other side of the spectrum and and just

2222
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,840
in thinking about

2223
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,960
um you know like our own perception of

2224
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,760
our self right like so how we hold on to

2225
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,159
our

2226
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,560
own like personality versus is it you

2227
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,320
know congruent with what others think of

2228
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:58,640
us

2229
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,040
so i'm thinking you know as how does

2230
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,640
this really relate to

2231
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,440
um meditation right like so in in

2232
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,239
meditation

2233
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,480
there's like the idea of getting rid of

2234
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,480
the asmita right like so

2235
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
where like that's the thing that builds

2236
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,600
the ego or

2237
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,920
like the construct of i so as we like

2238
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,960
eliminate this

2239
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,360
like construct of i and also like

2240
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,960
staying in the moment right like we're

2241
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,800
not necessarily trying to build

2242
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,199
an accurate predictive model in a

2243
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:25,920
meditation

2244
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,480
state so so when we have this like it's

2245
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,760
like this dissolution

2246
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,040
of of like free energy or or or what is

2247
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,960
happening like in in the meditative

2248
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,520
state

2249
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,920
um that can also bring about a drastic

2250
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,280
personality shift i think

2251
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,760
as we get get rid of the eye and learn

2252
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,280
to be non-reactive

2253
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,600
as opposed to like traumatic reaction

2254
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,040
that's done non-linear acceleration

2255
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,280
awesome adam and then marco then call it

2256
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,400
and then anyone else who wants to raise

2257
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,639
your hand

2258
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,480
hi um so uh

2259
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,159
let's try to address a couple of the

2260
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,679
threads um

2261
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,159
i'll come to meditation uh uh at the end

2262
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,040
i think

2263
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,600
but the um

2264
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,040
it seems like a lot of

2265
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,040
the um principles of personality

2266
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,320
uh in terms of their generality

2267
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,960
could be really interestingly modeled um

2268
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,040
actually using things like ant colonies

2269
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:33,360
uh

2270
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,239
like in daniel's work um and you might

2271
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,320
even find interestingly like even

2272
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
similar mechanisms at play so like in a

2273
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,600
recent paper

2274
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,960
starting to do active inferential

2275
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,400
modeling of ant colony uh behavior

2276
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,600
decisions and foraging um

2277
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,800
daniel mentions like you know that

2278
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
there's like the

2279
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,360
was it the foragers have more dopamine

2280
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,159
so you could see

2281
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:59,120
things like the functional significance

2282
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,480
of dopamine

2283
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,800
actually as its way of parameterizing

2284
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,159
a cybernetic system as being potentially

2285
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,600
similar although potentially switching

2286
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,880
across scales

2287
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,120
where in the individual ants and maybe

2288
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,360
even in the personality of the colony as

2289
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,719
a whole

2290
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,880
and there's would be actually this

2291
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,080
interesting interplay between the

2292
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,280
personalities

2293
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,679
of individual ants and the personalities

2294
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,960
of colonies

2295
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,040
and this interplay which might not be in

2296
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,400
exactly a one-for-one might

2297
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,840
actually even be a kind of um

2298
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,000
complementarity where certain

2299
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,440
characteristics being present

2300
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,400
on um this broader level this this more

2301
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,440
encompassing

2302
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,120
markov blanket where the individuals are

2303
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,719
part of a super organism or just

2304
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,640
the organism um from the perspective of

2305
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,719
natural selection because the colony is

2306
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,080
that which is selected uh

2307
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,600
as daniel says um but

2308
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,520
so the person out of the colony let's

2309
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,800
say um

2310
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,760
would then interface and interact with

2311
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,360
the personality of

2312
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,520
the uh the individuals of which it's

2313
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,560
composed

2314
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,280
and uh potentially in an in training way

2315
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,800
but potentially not

2316
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,960
um to loop around um

2317
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,000
you might even be able to uh at the

2318
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,920
level of

2319
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,360
a colony talk about things like the

2320
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,159
affect of tendencies that it's

2321
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,239
you know it's what is its what is the

2322
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,679
affect the valence

2323
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,440
the emotions experienced by the colony

2324
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,199
as a whole in a given instance

2325
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:33,360
what is its um uh

2326
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,440
general mood and then what are its

2327
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,640
patterns of mood across

2328
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,320
different situations it's and you might

2329
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,000
now we're kind of going into

2330
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,560
what we more call personality territory

2331
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,239
and you could even think of things like

2332
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,679
um to kind of bring in some of

2333
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,120
like marco's idea of the nature of

2334
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,760
trauma in this like dynamic system sense

2335
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,560
like

2336
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,640
you could traumatize the colony and does

2337
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,679
it then at some point like

2338
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,280
you would expect some sort of like

2339
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,440
elasticity or um what's the term like

2340
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,960
hysteresis i don't know not that but it

2341
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,760
would be

2342
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,760
you perturb it and then it it would have

2343
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,679
some sort of adaptive potential to

2344
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,679
come back from the perturbation because

2345
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,000
that's what

2346
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,080
we're trying to do is uh keep existing

2347
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,120
in the way we are and see

2348
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,120
some adaptive potential but you push it

2349
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,560
too far

2350
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,880
and then you might not get back this um

2351
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,040
adaptive attracting structure you might

2352
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,120
get stuck in a different regime

2353
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,040
um and you could think of the same

2354
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,000
things uh similar things

2355
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,520
this could be a way of describing things

2356
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,000
that happen within the within uh

2357
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,400
individuals like so there's um

2358
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,080
you can think of that maybe on multiple

2359
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,040
levels of abstraction but stop for now

2360
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,600
thanks yep i just switched the slide to

2361
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,000
figure two so colin and then marco go

2362
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,639
for it

2363
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,639
and maybe we can introduce the p-struct

2364
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,719
idea or just how does active inference

2365
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,400
specifically help us address some of

2366
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,679
these questions

2367
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,920
but go ahead call and then marco okay

2368
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,280
well what i'm

2369
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,960
uh my thoughts are about a couple of the

2370
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,800
last uh comments so they're

2371
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,239
sort of more related to the to the

2372
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,679
previous slide and then go ahead then

2373
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,120
it's fine

2374
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,840
um so in terms of both this discussion

2375
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,280
of what's going on in trauma and what's

2376
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,719
going on in meditation i think one of

2377
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,000
the interesting things to think about

2378
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,679
again is the distinction between the

2379
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,800
personality traits and the

2380
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
characteristic adaptations

2381
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,360
um because in in both there's the

2382
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,000
capacity for both of them to be shifted

2383
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,080
so marco was talking about the way in

2384
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,760
which in a traumatic event

2385
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,080
you are basically pre-existing goals and

2386
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,239
interpretations and strategies are

2387
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,000
dramatically invalidated and that

2388
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
you know then means that the system

2389
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,080
doesn't know how to pursue its goals in

2390
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,679
fact it may not even know what its goals

2391
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,520
should be and obviously that's extremely

2392
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,320
disruptive and disregulating and so one

2393
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,120
of the challenges

2394
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,719
in the immediate of course is to figure

2395
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,639
out uh what you should be doing what

2396
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,400
strategies you should be using

2397
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,400
but then there's also this capacity for

2398
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,880
that traumatic event uh to

2399
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,880
shift the underlying sensitivities of

2400
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,639
the system to what is perceived as

2401
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,199
disruptive in future right to sensitize

2402
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,159
to to the things that disrupt um and

2403
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:06,639
that

2404
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,719
is you know obviously an adapted

2405
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,480
response to say like if you're in a

2406
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,000
dangerous environment you should become

2407
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,880
more sensitive

2408
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,080
to uh to danger and the traumatic event

2409
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,520
just basically taught you that the world

2410
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,040
was a much more dangerous place than you

2411
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,800
thought that's part of what is

2412
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,480
uh tragic about it right because you

2413
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,920
have this persistent sense that the

2414
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,400
world

2415
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,000
potentially is much is much more

2416
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,600
dangerous even than it is or that you

2417
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,080
should experience it as being

2418
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,199
but then you have the same kinds of

2419
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,760
dynamics going on in

2420
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,199
um in meditation where trying to reduce

2421
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,000
your reactivity

2422
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,360
that's like trying to shift some of

2423
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,520
these basic parameters of

2424
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,600
the system so that you you know react

2425
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,920
less easily or disrupted less easily

2426
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,040
and then the kind of non-eye idea the

2427
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,239
recognition of the

2428
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,760
the illusory nature of the eye what

2429
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,199
that's about is basically not being

2430
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,560
overly attached

2431
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,760
to your uh model of yourself

2432
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,760
right because the model is the model

2433
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,880
it's not yourself

2434
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,520
so if you are overly attached to your

2435
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,040
model then you have you're overly

2436
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,560
attached to your conscious understanding

2437
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,320
of what your goals and your strategies

2438
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,760
are and what you're like

2439
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,600
and meditation is basically trying to

2440
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,800
get you to

2441
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,520
recognize those ideas that you have a

2442
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,320
they're just

2443
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,159
hey they're just your model they're not

2444
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,440
actually the way that you

2445
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,239
are and b they're contingent on your

2446
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,920
situation and so you should be willing

2447
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,760
to let them go as your situation changes

2448
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,199
and as things evolve

2449
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,000
and so it's essentially creating both a

2450
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,080
pattern of greater flexibility

2451
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,360
in the capacity to adapt but then also

2452
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,320
the attempt to uh down regulate the

2453
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,920
negative reaction to disruption right

2454
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,040
because if you have more confidence in

2455
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,480
your ability to adapt

2456
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,360
then you should uh be less defensively

2457
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,280
reactive to disruptions because you can

2458
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,000
be confident that

2459
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,800
you'll simply adapt to whatever the the

2460
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,880
new situation is

2461
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,239
thanks marco yeah thanks

2462
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,719
um yeah just just piggybacking on that

2463
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,000
because that was really nice

2464
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,360
um yes so so my thoughts on meditation

2465
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,199
and very good and important question i

2466
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,360
think um

2467
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,199
so so going back to the image of having

2468
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,040
all these different distributed micro

2469
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,880
personalities or some personalities

2470
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,480
i think meditation can be seen as

2471
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,880
allowing them to manifest and arise as

2472
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,000
it often is called

2473
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,639
and manifest the expressions which are

2474
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,760
always going on

2475
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,920
to also reach as a word the global

2476
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,520
workspace or consciousness

2477
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,320
or the conscious attention and so what

2478
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,600
you're doing then effectively is

2479
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,760
broadening the collective of sub-agents

2480
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,239
or sub-personalities or sub-systems

2481
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:37,120
such that that equilibrative process

2482
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:37,760
improves

2483
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,199
because then you have a bigger scope a

2484
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,679
bigger domain of possible inputs

2485
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,800
to an ongoing process of inference and

2486
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,920
importantly this is then

2487
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,840
of course without need for explicit

2488
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,360
modeling you don't need to explicitly

2489
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,080
label

2490
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:53,280
a certain um rashly or verbally

2491
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,560
explicated belief

2492
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,760
right it's an exercise in in the in the

2493
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,199
deepest sense of it

2494
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,360
uh importantly it's it's effectively a

2495
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,400
reflexive

2496
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,040
niche construction because meditation is

2497
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,239
systematically to

2498
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,320
basically disattenuate to yet to

2499
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,159
attenuate external inputs

2500
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,639
you sit in a very neutral position you

2501
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,560
close you're in a common environment

2502
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,040
external input is minimized and so all

2503
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,840
the inputs

2504
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,400
well it augments the inputs that is

2505
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,400
endogenous coming from within

2506
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,440
which of course is then going to

2507
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,560
translate or transfer

2508
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,520
to normal waking states because those

2509
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,880
are all the endogenous

2510
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,120
or it concerns all the possible

2511
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,960
endogenous influences on your ongoing

2512
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,320
cybernetics

2513
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,960
and so it's it's it's a reflexive shift

2514
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,239
right

2515
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,080
and yeah i don't know what i was going

2516
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,480
to say uh

2517
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,920
yeah so it's basically just a starting

2518
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,159
at the game so from what i have seen my

2519
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,040
limited experience

2520
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,920
with meditation and reading upon it it's

2521
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,199
all systematic

2522
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,960
cybernetic games it puts you in a

2523
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,600
situation that that forces you to train

2524
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
the process to underlie cybernetics

2525
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,760
concerning the purely reflexive

2526
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,360
which is of course beautiful because

2527
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,360
there's almost no opportunity for that

2528
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,679
it's an extremely exclusive states of

2529
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:08,719
being

2530
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,920
that exclusively force you to attend

2531
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,760
to these endogenous processes it's kind

2532
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,199
of the cybernetics of this urbanistics

2533
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,880
if that makes sense

2534
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
great points there it's why so much

2535
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,480
meditation begins with

2536
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,320
thankfulness and just to give actually

2537
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,320
one behavioral example

2538
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,719
um let's think about the example of a

2539
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,920
circus elephant

2540
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,360
where when it's young it has a heavy

2541
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,120
chain and it can't break away and then

2542
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,239
when it's older

2543
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:36,080
a simple thin rope can keep it connected

2544
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,120
so at a first pass one might say um

2545
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,199
well why doesn't it just break away why

2546
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,960
doesn't it engage in a policy of

2547
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,320
breaking away

2548
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,520
and the habits the e the priors over the

2549
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,600
policy the field of affordances

2550
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,840
may not even include that as an option

2551
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,679
so if certain types of actions

2552
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,080
are down regulated so to speak by 100x

2553
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,239
before any evidence comes in

2554
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,560
then it's going to be interpreted within

2555
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,719
a prior that down regulates or basically

2556
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,320
down waits the relevance or the

2557
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,840
likelihood of certain types of actions

2558
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,639
happening

2559
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,719
but also there's this element of the

2560
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,320
preferences where it may

2561
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,719
through whatever mechanism it's not an

2562
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,239
exact metaphor here

2563
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,080
the system kind of like a stockholm

2564
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,440
syndrome situation

2565
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,600
the system can actually uh internalize

2566
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,400
a preference for certain states that may

2567
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,480
or may not be consciously available

2568
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,719
during regular states of consciousness

2569
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,239
that lead into

2570
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,320
the implicit processing of everything

2571
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,080
within a framework that results in

2572
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,120
behavior that's not

2573
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,800
aligned with something else which could

2574
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,880
be external niche pressure or

2575
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,800
peer pressure or it could be

2576
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,320
disconcordant with one's own

2577
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,960
narrative themselves and then meditation

2578
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,639
is interesting to think about as far as

2579
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,320
isolating these different types of

2580
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,400
parameters in the model and different

2581
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,840
kinds of meditation lots of different

2582
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:52,480
ways to

2583
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,519
do it adam

2584
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,159
hi um

2585
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,920
hard to follow up on all that the um

2586
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,440
some of the way the threads came

2587
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,719
together for me uh

2588
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,120
was it seems like

2589
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,800
across varieties of meditation and

2590
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,360
why would you do such a thing um and

2591
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,800
ultimately like to

2592
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,159
bring back marco's point about

2593
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,560
empowerment um it's

2594
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,679
you want to be more capable in some way

2595
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,120
having a better grip

2596
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,840
on existence in a particular kind of way

2597
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,400
uh

2598
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,560
you want to be you have more you want to

2599
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,440
have

2600
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,159
more degrees of freedom with respect to

2601
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,360
the way you're engaging

2602
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,639
with the world and

2603
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,320
there's a sense in which you can think

2604
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,280
of different types of meditation

2605
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,719
as either as allowing you to

2606
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,159
navigate through cybernetically uh

2607
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,199
free energy energy landscapes which can

2608
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,639
uh and and also adjust the nature of

2609
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:03,760
these landscapes

2610
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,320
such that they are navigable so uh you

2611
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,080
can think of something like

2612
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,400
and to bring back and uh like something

2613
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,199
like trauma

2614
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,040
or something like uh the elephant

2615
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,560
getting stuck you can think of this as

2616
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,280
like a

2617
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,480
a getting stuck at a local optimum um

2618
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,480
of a potentially jagged free energy

2619
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,760
landscape

2620
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,600
and so if you can uh let's say reduce

2621
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,880
the uh some emotional

2622
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,840
uh regulation capacity the ability to

2623
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,679
defuse from experience

2624
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,920
and keep the gain on positive feedback

2625
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,120
loop cycles

2626
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,199
of thought and emotion from getting as

2627
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,199
high as they might

2628
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:42,400
you might be able to make the free

2629
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,239
energy landscape less jagged

2630
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,560
the difference is from point to point

2631
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,400
it's going to be

2632
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,520
you're not going to have these wild

2633
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,040
swings and so this might give you

2634
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,239
greater latitude

2635
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:55,440
with respect to pursuing more complex

2636
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,840
uh policies and actually i hope at some

2637
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,600
point we start to discuss some of uh

2638
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,280
colin's work on well-being

2639
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,679
because i think it docks uh there's a

2640
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,120
lot to be said there

2641
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,719
um but uh one thing uh

2642
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,400
on this one podcast com was mentioning

2643
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,840
like you can

2644
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,679
think of one of the benefits of

2645
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,880
mindfulness

2646
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,520
which is like in pursuing any kind of

2647
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,159
complex

2648
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,120
goal there's going to be a sort of

2649
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,120
trading off you're going to have to do

2650
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,920
against different things on on route

2651
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,560
there

2652
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,120
and so if you can like temporarily uh

2653
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,480
let some of your character say

2654
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,199
adaptation

2655
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,719
slide um let's some of your uh policies

2656
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:35,280
like

2657
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,639
not be as important if they're if

2658
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:37,840
they're not being if you think they

2659
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,280
ought to be realized but they're not

2660
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,280
um within some sort of like hierarchical

2661
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,360
hierarchical policy selection

2662
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,320
well then you can pursue uh you could

2663
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,120
hit targets

2664
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,639
you wouldn't uh otherwise you could eat

2665
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,400
me your mountain car you can get to the

2666
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,679
top of the mountain

2667
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,040
um in the mountain car problem um

2668
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,960
so yeah nice

2669
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,360
cool colin and then anyone else i just

2670
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,159
wanted to

2671
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,840
say to point out that that's that's the

2672
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,440
essence of non-attachment right you're

2673
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,560
not attached to

2674
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,760
particular policies and that means that

2675
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,760
you don't get hung up on a sub-goal

2676
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,159
when you should be shifting policies

2677
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:15,120
because what you are

2678
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,760
trying to pursue is some larger goal

2679
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,800
there's sort of you know there's a

2680
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,159
stereotype of

2681
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,560
uh meditation at least you know zen

2682
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,840
meditation for example buddhist

2683
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,800
meditation that

2684
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,960
you're eliminating your goals right you

2685
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,159
have no desires

2686
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,159
but that's not that is a that's a

2687
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,679
caricature right because it's not that

2688
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:32,800
you have no goals

2689
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,239
it's just that you're not attached to

2690
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,400
particular low-level goals you might be

2691
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,000
uh you know you probably remain attached

2692
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,440
to if you're a good buddhist for example

2693
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:39,920
to

2694
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,960
eliminating suffering for all beings and

2695
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:43,440
so

2696
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,320
it's not like you're not goal directed

2697
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,280
and you know you probably

2698
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,080
maintain maintain life by eating and

2699
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:50,880
things like this

2700
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,320
it's just that you're not attached to

2701
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,080
the particular policies that you might

2702
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,199
be using

2703
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,360
uh to achieve these higher level goals

2704
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,040
because goals are just nested i mean

2705
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,840
there's a way in which

2706
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,440
there's a goal but then the policy is

2707
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,800
also just a goal it's just there are

2708
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,120
nested goals all the way down to

2709
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,080
the terminals which are specific motor

2710
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,760
operations or specific cognitive

2711
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,960
operations

2712
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
and so non-attachment is basically

2713
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,880
becoming more flexible

2714
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,239
in which sub-goals you are willing to

2715
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:21,360
consider and to use

2716
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,080
very nice blue so i wonder if it's like

2717
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,159
it's more that it's not attachment to

2718
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,760
the policy but that actually is the

2719
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,480
policy

2720
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,360
and it's not attachment to the specific

2721
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,360
generative or predictive model i wonder

2722
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,239
if that's like

2723
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,400
because the policy is then the policy of

2724
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,000
non-attachment to the model or

2725
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,040
ultimate model flexibility and

2726
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,600
right so you could call it a net policy

2727
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,400
meta policy

2728
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,600
right and and so um and like secondly i

2729
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,560
wonder about

2730
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,840
uh you know the idea of staying in the

2731
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,120
in the present moment

2732
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,920
is this like some kind of free energy

2733
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,800
equilibrium

2734
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,280
like and not necessarily minimization

2735
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,159
but like

2736
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,239
if we take the generative model and the

2737
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:05,760
predictive model if we take like the

2738
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,040
value to zero

2739
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,880
are we like is meditation like staying

2740
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,480
in the present moment just like this

2741
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,840
ultimate state of

2742
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,480
of equilibrium in in free energy like

2743
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,760
info dynamics

2744
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,840
well interesting point about the hyper

2745
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,760
prior the bayesian hyper prior and also

2746
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,600
that's why a lot of meditation processes

2747
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,080
involve

2748
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,480
rhythmic or the cessation of other

2749
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,120
inputs

2750
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,040
because it allows the interoception

2751
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,560
potentially to proceed in a different

2752
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:28,960
way

2753
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,400
isolation tanks or other altered states

2754
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,440
of consciousness so

2755
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,360
let's do keeping comments short as well

2756
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,360
a few minutes left adam and then marco

2757
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,760
in terms of uh there's this one paper

2758
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,520
actually that just came out recently but

2759
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,320
a model of meditation with respect to

2760
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,639
the temporal depth and counterfactual

2761
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,000
richness

2762
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,400
of uh your generative modeling uh that

2763
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,679
just came out i'm

2764
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:01,840
i'll try to find that in sundance but i

2765
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,120
think that would speak to this idea of

2766
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,719
staying in the present moment

2767
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,639
but also this idea of um staying in the

2768
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:07,840
present moment

2769
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,600
um also makes me think of this uh

2770
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,040
mark was like kind of intimating that

2771
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,800
you can think of meditation as a kind of

2772
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,440
uh

2773
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,920
like game task or almost like a kind of

2774
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,880
like

2775
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,000
uh maybe maybe play even uh but it's

2776
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,120
this building

2777
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:33,520
capacity um that is

2778
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,639
building capacity

2779
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,679
okay we'll come back mark up four okay

2780
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:42,480
good so

2781
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,400
a building of capacity through relaxing

2782
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,440
some of your priors and so

2783
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,119
letting you to be

2784
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:57,040
informed by policies with respect to

2785
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,000
mental acts

2786
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,480
that you might not normally deploy and

2787
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,440
you might not

2788
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,239
normally notice um what is entailed when

2789
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,679
you deploy certain types of mental act

2790
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:06,800
so things might

2791
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,920
come to mind uh that wouldn't normally

2792
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,040
uh that would place you now in into a

2793
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,080
different state of

2794
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,000
uh affect of inference and so i think

2795
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,400
uh if we wanted to do uh modeling of

2796
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,040
this of

2797
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,360
something like meditation uh we would

2798
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,480
want to use

2799
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,480
this sort of imaginative policy

2800
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,000
selection described by

2801
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,920
something like sophisticated affect of

2802
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,040
inference

2803
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,080
and that would begin to get us there um

2804
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,159
the exact way and one more thought

2805
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,280
before we move on is

2806
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,600
um one more thing i was actually

2807
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,719
wondering with respect to

2808
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,000
meditation i've talked about this some

2809
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,800
with colin is

2810
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,800
above the traits in the personality

2811
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,679
hierarchy you have these meta traits of

2812
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,920
stability and plasticity

2813
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,199
and stability

2814
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,560
uh is this shared variance over and uh

2815
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,440
colin actually uh named these um it's

2816
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,560
the shared variance over

2817
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,639
neuroticism inverse neuroticism

2818
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,159
agreeableness and conscientiousness and

2819
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,280
plasticity

2820
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,840
is the shared variance over extraversion

2821
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,360
and openness intellect

2822
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,199
and interestingly the stability seems to

2823
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,880
be basically the inverse of

2824
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,400
the general psychopathology factor p um

2825
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,119
by and large but i think thinking of

2826
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,719
mindfulness and meditation

2827
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,719
with respect to building capacities for

2828
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,600
both stability and plasticity which um

2829
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,520
helping to

2830
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,679
basically place this so you can think of

2831
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,040
stability as

2832
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,159
your ability to follow through on and

2833
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,560
protect your policies or characteristic

2834
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,679
adaptations

2835
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:42,960
and then plasticity would be your

2836
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,719
tendency to form new characteristic

2837
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,080
adaptations so like whether um

2838
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,239
so let's say you do encounter trauma

2839
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,199
plasticity

2840
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,119
might be what makes the difference so

2841
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,719
stability would be how much

2842
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:57,199
it might make sense to the degree to

2843
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,880
which you're actually traumatized like

2844
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,080
you're very stable

2845
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,000
something might you know bounce right

2846
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,080
off you you're not traumatized

2847
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,639
but let's say you don't have a lot of

2848
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,679
plasticity

2849
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,360
and that instability is compromised

2850
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,119
plasticity is the thing that would let

2851
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,400
you update

2852
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,600
and uh create

2853
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,480
new strategies for being in the world

2854
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,119
and

2855
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,960
so they're kind of the state of dynamic

2856
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,719
tension in that they can like

2857
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,119
pull at each other um but they're both

2858
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,560
ultimately synergistic and they're like

2859
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,239
you're not going to be particularly

2860
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,600
plastic unless you have this foundation

2861
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,119
of stability and you're not going to be

2862
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:32,480
able to maintain your stability long

2863
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,159
unless you're meta stable

2864
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,320
and so part of with meditation and

2865
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,600
mindfulness i'm wondering if one way of

2866
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,040
thinking of it is it's part of what's

2867
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:39,520
actually

2868
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,679
really letting you kind of like ride

2869
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,600
this optimum of balance stability and

2870
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,880
plasticity

2871
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,320
and that could be one way of thinking

2872
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,119
about part of what um people get from it

2873
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:52,239
cool marco then colin

2874
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,480
yeah that's amazing that is a perfect

2875
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,280
setup yeah

2876
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,600
um i i also fully agree with this theme

2877
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,440
of complementarity right so

2878
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,560
stability and plasticity sounds it

2879
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,679
really resonates with plasticity sorry

2880
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,600
openness and focus which is a big

2881
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,520
complimentary uh

2882
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,000
yeah big polarity in meditation

2883
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,360
practices right so if

2884
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,600
open meditation and just feel everything

2885
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,119
let it all come in etc

2886
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,040
focus meditation you know focus on one

2887
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,480
point one

2888
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,520
mantra um and that

2889
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,880
has a bigger connection to the the more

2890
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,760
well-known complementary polarity of

2891
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,000
exploration exploitation right

2892
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,920
but it's not about the polarities per se

2893
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,600
it's it's always about the balancing the

2894
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,080
math

2895
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,840
and for example the sussex said also a

2896
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,360
nice paper on that it's

2897
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,719
not about perfect theoretical

2898
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,560
representations you can have some errors

2899
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,000
it's about how you balance everything

2900
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,040
off and so again we go back to the

2901
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,080
idea notion that meditation can be games

2902
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,960
where you

2903
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,600
effectively practice balancing that off

2904
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,000
because

2905
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,159
that balance is not something you can

2906
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,520
explicitly verbalize

2907
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,719
it's intrinsically pre-verbal because

2908
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,400
you can't verbalize maybe the

2909
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,639
particular strategies or beliefs

2910
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,800
forcibility or for plasticity

2911
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,719
but to balance them off is more

2912
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,800
effective it's more

2913
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,320
flexible or fluid and so the another

2914
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,400
interesting maybe duality that you can

2915
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,920
think of is also equilibriums

2916
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,560
and games or contexts right so in game

2917
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,080
theory you have an equilibrium for a

2918
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,600
particular game or setting

2919
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,199
and so what you said earlier about

2920
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,199
equilibrium and staying in the moment

2921
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,040
uh regarding meditation i think it's a

2922
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,520
very nice idea what adam already said

2923
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,639
is that um by being in a particular game

2924
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,960
which is that meditative practice

2925
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,119
um you will naturally buy free energy

2926
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,960
minimization go to a particular kind of

2927
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,080
equilibrium

2928
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,080
but that necessitates change some

2929
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,080
updates and those updates might actually

2930
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,960
mean

2931
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,440
that your equilibrium seeking behavior

2932
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,119
or your attractors will be different

2933
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,679
in the other context so the underlying

2934
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,280
assumption is that these particular

2935
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,840
changes in equilibriums or priors

2936
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,119
or attractors are transferable so

2937
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,760
um yeah does that make sense as for your

2938
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,520
question on meditation presence

2939
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,080
playing in the presence yeah cool

2940
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:08,560
thoughts

2941
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,920
colin i was just going to say a little

2942
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:12,719
bit more about

2943
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,600
stability and plasticity i think that

2944
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,679
those can be seen as the two

2945
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,280
fundamental needs of any cybernetic

2946
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,199
or active inference system that exists

2947
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,840
in a complex or changing or

2948
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,520
unpredictable environment

2949
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,000
and so stability is in some sense just

2950
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
the the most fundamental requirement

2951
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,560
because

2952
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,639
the system must be able to pursue its

2953
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:37,760
goals effectively

2954
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,719
in order to be a cybernetic system right

2955
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:42,400
if it's an organism that's what it

2956
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,719
must have in order to persist and even

2957
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,400
an artificial system in order to persist

2958
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,760
as the system that it is

2959
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,119
it must be moving effectively toward

2960
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,239
its goals but then

2961
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:55,679
if you have any degree of

2962
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,760
unpredictability in the environment you

2963
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
can't just be satisfied with the same

2964
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:00,080
set

2965
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,080
of policies that you have at any given

2966
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,760
time you're going to have to be able to

2967
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,199
update your policies generate new

2968
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,000
policies

2969
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,600
and so that immediately in order to

2970
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,440
remain stable over time in a changing

2971
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,159
environment

2972
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:12,560
you also have to be somewhat adaptive or

2973
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,600
plastic

2974
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,920
and so you have these inherent

2975
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,080
necessities for the capacity to

2976
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,360
maintain a stable order of goal directed

2977
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,320
functioning

2978
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,719
and then the capacity to generate new

2979
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:28,080
components of the model right new

2980
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,840
policies or even new goals or new

2981
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,520
interpretations of the

2982
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,400
of the situation that you're in and then

2983
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,080
those so those are complementary

2984
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,920
but they can also they are also in

2985
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,840
dynamic tension as adam mentioned

2986
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:40,400
because

2987
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,560
if you're massively exploratory it can

2988
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,159
be difficult to remain stable because

2989
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,119
you have so much

2990
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,320
new uh you know information coming in

2991
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,040
um similarly if you are well i mean

2992
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,400
we've essentially already covered what

2993
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,880
the the danger of being too inflexible

2994
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,400
and too unexploratory because

2995
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,840
you may work fine now but as the

2996
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,199
environment changes as things change

2997
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:00,080
over time

2998
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,480
then you become unadapted to your

2999
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,520
situation

3000
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,960
so stability and plasticity aren't

3001
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,480
opposite to each other right stability

3002
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,159
the opposite of stability is instability

3003
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,719
the opposite of plasticity is rigidity

3004
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,000
you can be stable and plastic

3005
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,760
or stable and rigid you can be unstable

3006
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,960
and plastic and unstable and rigid

3007
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,719
cool adam go ahead

3008
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,840
hi um

3009
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:34,159
it seems like at some point it could be

3010
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:35,840
good to discuss connections

3011
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,880
of narrative perspectives on personality

3012
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:39,440
because

3013
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,159
this idea of narrative as active

3014
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,440
inference

3015
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,800
and the work trying to be done there i

3016
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,840
think there could be like a rich

3017
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:46,800
interchange because

3018
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,400
in some ways you can think of you know

3019
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,440
selves as centers of narrative gravity

3020
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,239
and you can think of personality as

3021
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,320
styles and modes of narration

3022
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,280
and themes and motifs as you are this

3023
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,719
semi-reliable

3024
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,040
narrator telling your story and making

3025
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,560
and enacting it and making it so

3026
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,080
two degrees um and this being a source

3027
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:08,560
of

3028
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,080
to the degree you have stability and

3029
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,760
plasticity um

3030
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,520
this would be one source of it the

3031
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,800
ability of narratives to provide

3032
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,639
cross-situational intertemporal common

3033
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,840
context

3034
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,560
and but also because of their richness

3035
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:22,960
to

3036
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,480
create this rich this kind of

3037
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:27,840
their combinatorics and rich

3038
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,520
representative capacity

3039
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,400
also being a source of plasticity and so

3040
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,040
um

3041
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,119
narrative being a source of balance

3042
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,280
dynamic balancing this dynamic tension

3043
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,159
although the narrative itself can also

3044
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:42,320
not be a source of balance but imbalance

3045
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,560
if the style of narration becomes

3046
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,440
problematic

3047
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,440
and so that kind of mindfulness enters

3048
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,639
in there again

3049
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,760
where um it might suck your usual styles

3050
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,000
of

3051
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,400
narrative narratorization you might let

3052
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,400
that go a bit you go um

3053
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,840
this is this is the way in which you go

3054
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,920
naive based on your expectations

3055
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,719
um yep the stories provide the polls and

3056
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:04,719
the archetypes and then you can say okay

3057
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,000
it's like goldilocks

3058
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,760
but for the internet of things or

3059
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,280
something like that and that gives you a

3060
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,159
vocabulary to communicate and design

3061
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,600
you might need a very different story in

3062
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,600
a very different context and kind of

3063
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,800
bring it back to trauma that might be

3064
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,239
all the difference between whether

3065
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:19,840
you get stuck or you experience post

3066
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,520
traumatic growth

3067
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,480
yeah cool interesting and just um one

3068
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,280
closing

3069
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,800
uh slide that i want to put up while

3070
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,560
people prepare their thoughts this is a

3071
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,920
question just from

3072
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,480
a audience member they wrote i have a

3073
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,760
question about what happens when

3074
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,199
blankets intersect

3075
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,960
blankets of blankets and so let's think

3076
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,639
about this in this kind of

3077
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,960
blankets of physiologically relevant

3078
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,760
states

3079
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,080
informationally relevant what what um

3080
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,199
think about what we're talking about

3081
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:45,679
here

3082
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,920
and at which nodes that would happen and

3083
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,199
then there's a link to a

3084
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,280
talk by carl firsten and a question

3085
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,119
about how nodes intersect

3086
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,520
and just while people are thinking about

3087
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,400
this or their

3088
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,440
last thoughts on the paper one note is

3089
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,520
about the scientists and the personality

3090
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,080
scientist

3091
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,320
as an informational forager as an active

3092
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,159
inference agent themselves

3093
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:08,800
and so our quest to reduce uncertainty

3094
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,400
about personality

3095
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,840
it shouldn't be about the optimal

3096
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,400
descriptor it should lead to a question

3097
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,159
of ourselves which is what is the

3098
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:18,639
optimal perturbation that we can design

3099
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,239
that will reduce our uncertainty the

3100
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:21,920
most about this

3101
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,320
individual's personality and so that

3102
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,159
takes into account population level

3103
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,920
dynamics as a prior but personalized and

3104
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:30,480
um

3105
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,719
kind of dynamic testing so imagine

3106
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,800
having a baseline prior across knowledge

3107
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,960
architectures that people had and then

3108
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,119
having a dynamically updating online

3109
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:39,840
course

3110
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,080
that was optimally informative from both

3111
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,840
sides of the interface it was optimally

3112
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,119
informative for what kind of learner the

3113
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:45,920
person was

3114
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,840
and they were reducing their uncertainty

3115
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,360
optimally about

3116
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,360
the topic at hand and so that was like a

3117
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,360
co-evolutionary process

3118
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,520
amidst a prior that was population level

3119
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,040
but personalized in the individual

3120
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,320
trajectory

3121
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,639
so it's a really interesting framework

3122
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,639
in colin adam thanks a lot for

3123
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,199
coming on the stream was like really

3124
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,239
helpful

3125
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,080
and we're excited that you'll come back

3126
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,239
for next week so in these last couple

3127
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,199
minutes anyone

3128
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,920
can raise their hand give a last thought

3129
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,199
what would be something that we would

3130
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,159
want to

3131
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,360
say to this slide about how nodes

3132
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,280
intersecting stories intersecting

3133
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,639
individuals intersecting

3134
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,520
how does that come into play and or what

3135
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,159
should we

3136
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,400
be thinking about for 13.2 that would be

3137
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,879
good to cover

3138
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,639
shannon and then anyone else who raises

3139
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:36,960
their hand

3140
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,960
i guess i have a thought about um the

3141
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,960
question on this slide

3142
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,800
um so is um one node that's

3143
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,400
a send state and one blanket the

3144
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
internal state of another blanket

3145
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,840
like that's totally the case because

3146
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,480
you basically choose the perspective and

3147
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,440
whichever

3148
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:58,000
you know blanket sort of internal state

3149
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,320
you want to describe or whichever

3150
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,679
thing that you're calling the agent

3151
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,360
separate from its

3152
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,199
environment then that's the

3153
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,239
internal state that you're going to

3154
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:09,760
describe and if you're looking at like

3155
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,360
if this blue node is a neuron and you

3156
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,560
want to actually

3157
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,719
know about this pink node this other

3158
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,239
neuron's internal state then that's

3159
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:16,800
going to be

3160
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:19,040
your internal state and these other guys

3161
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,159
are going to be the sun state the

3162
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,440
blanket around it

3163
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,280
and that's going to be the statistical

3164
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,880
boundary that you're using

3165
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,840
to explain the behavior of that neuron

3166
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,560
and then

3167
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,080
you can aggregate and this collection of

3168
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,000
neurons will all be an internal state

3169
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,760
for the next collection of neurons so

3170
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,760
the answer is in the question that's

3171
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,199
exactly right perfect answer

3172
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,719
showing that the answer is in the

3173
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:43,920
question is the answer

3174
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,040
adam

3175
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,840
uh in terms of uh loop around to a

3176
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,119
previous thought in terms of uh

3177
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:58,480
nested uh blankets um

3178
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,880
and where these different uh blankets

3179
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,920
might have different

3180
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,920
characteristics and their interaction um

3181
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,639
for personality uh there's some

3182
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:09,920
interesting work um

3183
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,400
uh column might disagree on titan loose

3184
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,360
cultures

3185
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,400
where you can think of like the

3186
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,480
personality of the culture within

3187
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,159
and this tightness and looseness seems

3188
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,159
to correspond to this stability

3189
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,400
plasticity dynamic tension

3190
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,480
this fundamental cybernetic parameters

3191
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,239
showing up on the group level

3192
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,239
and even theory can get this kind of

3193
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:29,679
complementarity there where a tight

3194
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:30,480
culture

3195
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,800
might create more tight um individuals

3196
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,840
with respect to

3197
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,960
the degree of which you know they let

3198
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,119
their their power whether they have a

3199
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:38,639
meta policy of letting their policies

3200
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:39,679
slide more

3201
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,960
um in different contexts but uh

3202
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,880
or instead of it being this sort of

3203
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,159
entrainment relation

3204
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:47,760
it could be a complementary relation

3205
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,080
where the stability on the level of the

3206
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,719
group

3207
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:53,920
this broader um

3208
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,080
attractor affords the fine grain the sub

3209
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,880
systems to actually have more latitude

3210
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,320
and vice versa

3211
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,880
um and i imagine you might probably see

3212
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,400
similar things play out like with ant

3213
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,440
colonies

3214
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,719
um interesting point about multi-level

3215
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,199
systems and how they're associated with

3216
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,320
relative

3217
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,840
constraints in the last two

3218
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,560
three minutes let's think of a last you

3219
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,679
know if anyone who wants to raise their

3220
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:22,880
hand give a word or

3221
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,360
a sentence or few what is something that

3222
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,080
you took away

3223
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,560
or was exciting today and what was

3224
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,159
something that we could

3225
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:33,199
continue talking about in 13.2 and pick

3226
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,560
up where we left off

3227
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,000
marco and then just anyone else who

3228
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,320
raises their hands

3229
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,840
yeah i just wanted to thank everyone

3230
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,440
this was like really amazing it's my

3231
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,400
first

3232
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,199
this this kind of stream seminar in ages

3233
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:46,639
so thank you it's innovating

3234
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:48,480
and i think in general what's to be

3235
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,239
taken away i think is

3236
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,880
excitement because it's kind of amazing

3237
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,960
how many different domains and topics

3238
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,000
and questions

3239
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,080
have been successfully synthesized in

3240
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,599
this big discussion and i think that's a

3241
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:00,639
testament

3242
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:01,920
to the power of these kinds of

3243
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,560
frameworks of bayesian or active infants

3244
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,320
free energy cybernetics

3245
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,960
when it comes to understanding us people

3246
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,960
us persons personalities

3247
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,239
um as individuals as as collectives so

3248
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,119
thank you again for exciting me thank

3249
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:17,679
you

3250
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,800
well said and the group performance

3251
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,119
is uh only realized it's only enacted

3252
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:24,560
even digitally

3253
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,960
when the people show up and it's only

3254
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,400
relevant when there's the regime of

3255
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,280
attention

3256
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,760
and so there's so much you know fun and

3257
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,040
it's great to have you

3258
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,199
um multiple of you on your first time

3259
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,040
here that's always appreciated

3260
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,639
so any other thoughts in the last minute

3261
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,840
otherwise in the calendar invite is a

3262
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,800
feedback form

3263
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,320
so if you're just wanting to think a

3264
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,280
little bit more if you're live

3265
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,239
participant you want to think a little

3266
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:49,760
more about what we could cover next week

3267
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,080
just

3268
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,560
put it in that feedback form and then

3269
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,840
anyone who's watching it

3270
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,599
just leave a comment for something that

3271
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:58,320
we can address even if it's after 13.2

3272
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,560
maybe we can swoop back and return to

3273
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,080
some previous comments but

3274
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,119
this was a super fun discussion and a

3275
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,280
big thanks to all the participants

3276
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,400
so really good times everyone and thanks

3277
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,400
a lot

3278
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,879
so see you next week
