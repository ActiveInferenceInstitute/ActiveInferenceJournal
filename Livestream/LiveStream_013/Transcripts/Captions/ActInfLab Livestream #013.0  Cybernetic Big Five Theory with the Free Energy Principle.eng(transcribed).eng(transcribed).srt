00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
i think we are live this is active

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,120
inference live stream

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,279
13.0 it is january 3rd

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,920
2021 welcome to the active

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
inference lab everyone new and old

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
listeners

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
we are an experiment in online team

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
communication learning and practice

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
related to active inference you can find

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,679

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
this is a recorded and an archived live

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
feedback so that we can improve on our

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
work in the live chat or in comments

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
and all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,559
welcome here

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,480
video etiquette for live stream mute if

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
there's noise in the background

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,879
raise your hand so we can hear from

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,840
everyone and use respectful speech

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,000
behavior

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
so happy 2021 everyone

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
for the scheduled active inference live

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
streams in 2021 we're going to do

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
every single tuesday from 7 to 9 a.m

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,520
pacific

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,200
time which will include daylight savings

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
time changes

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,119
and for schedule and participation

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
instructions just go to this

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
shortened link here also we're going to

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
do several special sessions for example

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
coding sessions or discussions with

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
external people from other communities

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
and just if you have an idea for an

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,799
event that you think could be

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,600
interesting

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
or you would like to moderate or just

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
suggest you can let us know or you can

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
send a tweet and tag that person if you

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,000
know them

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
and then we can set it up but the

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,119
regular

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
active inference live streams the group

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,880
plan discussions

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
are at again that shortened link and it

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,159
has

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
instructions for how to let us know you

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
want to participate in any of these

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,799
events and the first two weeks of

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,719
january so these next two weeks

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,280
we are going to be in uh reading this

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
paper

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
by adam saffron and colin deyoung and

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
then you can see whatever papers are

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
most updated for the next several months

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
at that link today in

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,040
active inference live stream 13.0 the

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520
goal is really to set context for 13.1

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,959
and 13.2

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
so kind of like a read-along for the

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
paper if you want to participate in the

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
discussion or if you want more context

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,040
on it

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
and the paper is integrating cybernetic

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
big five theory with a free energy

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
principle

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
a new strategy for modeling

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
personalities as complex systems by

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,519
saffron and

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
young on october 16 2020 at this psi

76
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
archive link and the video just like all

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
the point zeros are

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
is just an introduction to the ideas and

79
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
the context it's not a review or a final

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,280
word

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
the punchline of the paper is that we

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
can combine psychology with the

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
cybernetic theories

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,239
of cb 5t the cybernetic big 5 theory

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,879
which

86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
we'll discuss and free energy principle

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
active inference to have a better

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,519
understanding of psychobehavioral

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
dynamics in humans and other systems

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
the sections of 13 will be as follows

91
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
first will be

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
the aims and claims of the paper then

93
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
the keywords

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
abstract and roadmap then go through the

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
figures and the table

96
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
and then conclude with several questions

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
that people can ask themselves whatever

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
level of familiarity they have with the

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
ideas so in 13.1

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,200
and 13.2 we're going to be discussing

101
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
this paper as a group

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
so save and submit your questions and

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
get in touch if you want to participate

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
okay the paper is as said on the

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,120
previous

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
slide the aims and claims of the paper

107
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
in the author's words are

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
from the conclusion we have begun to

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,080
outline how artificial agents based upon

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
free energy principle and active

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
inference might be used to test

112
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,200
cybernetic big five theories

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
uh theoretical propositions regarding

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
the functional significance of the

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,519
dimensions

116
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,439
in the big five trait hierarchy which is

117
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
from psychology

118
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
here are the implications and why it

119
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
matters from the

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
author's conclusion as well if deep

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
correspondences can be found between

122
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,760
cb5t

123
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,120
and fep-ai as we suggest is likely to be

124
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,799
the case due to their common cybernetic

125
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,840
foundations

126
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
then this integration may allow

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
personality modelers to obtain new

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
understanding with respect to functions

129
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
and then to parlay that understanding of

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
function into new hypotheses about

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,798
mechanisms

132
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,919
in the brain and finally

133
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,759
identifying the configurations of

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,440
personality mechanisms that correspond

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
to effective cybernetic function

136
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
may yield insights into how personality

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
imbalances can lead to mental disorders

138
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
thereby furthering the aims of

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,639
computational psychiatry and other

140
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,840
attempts at developing

141
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,759
theories of human mental health and

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,960
well-being so

143
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
that is what they have set out to do and

144
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
by the conclusion that's where they want

145
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,199
to have

146
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
gotten and these dot zero videos

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,759
are meant to be a sort of bi-directional

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,080
on

149
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
and off ramp for those in the active

150
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
inference community it's

151
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
a chance to see the fields that active

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
inference is adjacent to

153
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
and for those who might be learning

154
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
about active inference for even the

155
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,479
first time

156
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
it could still possibly be a way to

157
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,759
learn about this

158
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,039
broad area from wherever you are

159
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
as far as familiarity with these

160
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
keywords which include active inference

161
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
in the free energy principle

162
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
but also generative models cybernetics

163
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
and the cybernetic

164
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
big five theory and then there's a few

165
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
related keywords as well

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,479
so first active inference and i

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,960
got some interesting feedback and just

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
thought about it over the new year and i

169
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
think it's a great exercise to

170
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
always start with just what active

171
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
inference is just like how

172
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
evolutionary biology which is in the

173
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,120
area i'm in

174
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
often talks will begin with the

175
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
principles of natural selection

176
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
because they're then going to be

177
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
demonstrated in the subsequent sections

178
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,160
so

179
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
even just having a high level

180
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
summarization allows

181
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
an individual to personalize their

182
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,639
approach to

183
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,479
portraying what active inferences in the

184
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
context of a specific system

185
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
or question just like an evolutionary

186
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
biologist doesn't need to re-justify all

187
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,440
of natural selection

188
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
they just draw upon those principles and

189
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,199
outlines and then apply them

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
i'm going to start with active inference

191
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
in the words of the author whose paper

192
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,919
we're reading

193
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
and they wrote work within the free

194
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,600
energy principle paradigm

195
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
has yielded a normative model of

196
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,479
behavior called active inference

197
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,080
the active inference framework describes

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
processes by which free energy is

199
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
minimized and provides close ties to

200
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
other frameworks such as expected

201
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
utility theory and risk sensitive

202
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
control

203
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
further advances in deep reinforcement

204
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
learning appear to be converging on the

205
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,400
kinds of solutions that are predicted to

206
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,919
be necessary for bounded

207
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
optimal decision making and learning in

208
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
the free energy principle and active

209
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
inference framework

210
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,039
and another quotation that they have

211
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,240
about active inference

212
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
is the development of the active

213
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,240
inference framework has made connections

214
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
between free energy principle

215
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
and cybernetics more obvious as it

216
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
highlights that organisms are motivated

217
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
not only

218
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
to predict their perceptions accurately

219
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
but also to influence states of the

220
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
world in order to ensure that

221
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
perceptions correspond to goal

222
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,120
attainment

223
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
so that's two really nice quotes on

224
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
active inference from the authors

225
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
and here's just a way that i kind of

226
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,039
laid it out here maybe we can even try

227
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
a new one every single time or something

228
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
similar

229
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
active inference is a framework which

230
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,479
means that it's a

231
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
cluster of scientific theories which are

232
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
ideas that make specific testable

233
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,199
predictions hypotheses about the world

234
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,319
that's a theory

235
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
and tools so that includes software

236
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
toolkits and vocabularies and

237
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,039
shared narratives so it's a framework

238
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,440
it's beyond just a single hypothesis but

239
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
there are important hypotheses that are

240
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,639
more or less central to what it

241
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
says in specific cases it's a framework

242
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,199
that integrates action

243
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,080
and perception so action is whatever the

244
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
behavior of the system of interest is

245
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
so if we're talking about a certain

246
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,360
bacterial possibility and affordance

247
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
that a bacteria can undertake

248
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
then we're talking about action being

249
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
our measurement

250
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,560
of something that's for example moving

251
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
or being secreted in the world

252
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
or emitted from a hidden state and

253
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
perception

254
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
is sort of the obverse of action in some

255
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,039
way and it relates to

256
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,199
the sensory capacity of the system of

257
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
interest

258
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
and as we've talked about in other

259
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,599
discussions

260
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,840
there's something like a interface being

261
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
defined with the organism and the

262
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
environment so that's how we're

263
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
integrating internalism and externalism

264
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
reductionism and holism all these things

265
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
are coming together

266
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
because by defining the interface that

267
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,039
one is studying the blanket of some type

268
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
you're at the same time delimiting the

269
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,800
system from

270
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
the external part so you're not assuming

271
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
that there's another level of

272
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
boundedness like a closed system beyond

273
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,159
the refrigerator and the kitchen

274
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
you can now just model it as your

275
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,719
inference on a certain boundedness given

276
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,000
the measurements and the structure

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
of the system little digression it

278
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
integrates action and perception

279
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
downstream of the free energy principle

280
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
free energy principle is a statistical

281
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
physics approach to modeling

282
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,760
complex multi-scale systems so it uses

283
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,959
several different threads of physics and

284
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,279
for those who are just learning about it

285
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,320
there are

286
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,360
a lot uh better resources than here to

287
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,959
hear specifically about

288
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,440
the mathematical details in this

289
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,399
discussion

290
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,200
but we hope to be able to provide easy

291
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
entry points for this

292
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
aspect of the discussion as well and

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,480
it's

294
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
about how far from equilibrium systems

295
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
work so things that are

296
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
passive like let's just say a cloud of

297
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,360
gas

298
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
accreting in some galaxy somewhere

299
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,120
it can appeal to just gravitational

300
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
forces to

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
describe the dynamics through time

302
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
however there are systems whose dynamics

303
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
through time

304
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
like organisms uh their dynamics through

305
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,399
time do not resemble

306
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
that of passive bodies and so there's

307
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
these active systems

308
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
and what is it that these active systems

309
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
these mega entropic systems

310
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,839
organization uh in the world how is this

311
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,399
happening

312
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
what is life that's where that element

313
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
comes in but those are the systems that

314
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
we want to understand design predict and

315
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
control so active inference is a

316
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
framework that integrates action and

317
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
perception

318
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,480
downstream of the free energy principle

319
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
to explain how far from equilibrium

320
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
systems work

321
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
what about generative models generative

322
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
models can be contrasted with

323
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
descriptive models

324
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
descriptive models go from data which

325
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
are observations about the world

326
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
to or results of an experiment and go

327
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,079
from data

328
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
to then the modeling of parameters about

329
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,279
the world so

330
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
given the height of these 50 children

331
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,800
what is the mean

332
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,079
and the variance of height in the

333
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
classroom and so statistics can be

334
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
seen as a specific kind of dimensional

335
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
reduction about measurements in the

336
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,480
world

337
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
for example you have 50 measurements

338
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
that's a 50 dimensional vector

339
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,279
and then it's being reduced onto a mean

340
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
and a variance component so two numbers

341
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,640
it's like a bottleneck that only two

342
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
numbers get to pass through

343
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,600
so it's a dimensional reduction and then

344
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
you hope that those dimensions

345
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
capture the average value

346
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
of the trait or whatever and the

347
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,079
variability

348
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
so that's going from data to the model

349
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
dimensional reduction

350
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,680
generative models go the other direction

351
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,320
which is

352
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,279
from the model's parameters for example

353
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,640
the mean and the variance

354
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,120
to the expected data given a mean and a

355
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,640
variance estimate for height the two

356
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
numbers

357
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
can we generate sets of predicted

358
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
measurements that are consistent so

359
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
generate 50 a draw of 50 children and so

360
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
even if it's 51

361
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
uh it's going to be just changing it a

362
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
little bit and the average is going to

363
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
recapitulate those two numbers but it's

364
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,079
going to be

365
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,519
possible to generate hundreds or

366
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
thousands or counter factual worlds

367
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
given this generative model

368
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
generative models are useful for

369
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,040
statisticians

370
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,720
for a lot of the same but also some of

371
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
the different reasons that they're

372
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,440
different

373
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
or that they're useful for organisms to

374
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
have generative models

375
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
so here's some of the similarities is

376
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
that in both the statistician and the

377
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,279
organismal case

378
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
it allows the system to use a lot of its

379
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,040
previous knowledge

380
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
on sparse data sets because generative

381
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,240
models

382
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
might only need a slight cue to tip

383
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
their likelihood from something very

384
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
unlikely to totally likely for example

385
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
hearing uh the sound of an ambulance

386
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,839
outside your window means that it's

387
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,040
extremely likely that there is an

388
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,000
ambulance there

389
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
even though it's also possible that

390
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
there's one at other times it makes it

391
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,399
extremely likely

392
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
and one kind of model that's used that's

393
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,399
a generative model

394
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
and a way just to understand without the

395
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
control theory without the cybernetics

396
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
how a generative model is useful

397
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
statistically is what's called

398
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,079
expectation maximization and this cycle

399
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,880
expectation maximization the data or

400
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
initial estimates are input

401
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
into what can be thought of as one layer

402
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
of the model which is just the estimator

403
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
of the observed data parameters

404
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
and parameter is just in the

405
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,000
computational sense any

406
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
single variable that's going to be

407
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
stored so these are the the data this is

408
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
the actual 50

409
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
children in their heights and then

410
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
there's a maximization step

411
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
which asks what is the maximum

412
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,680
likelihood of those underlying hidden

413
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,480
parameters

414
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
which can be a different dimension than

415
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
this one and then

416
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,000
there's a generation step which is the

417
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
expectation step which data are expected

418
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
uh or expectable i guess i don't think

419
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
that's a word but that's kind of it

420
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
given the hidden parameters that are in

421
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,320
the world

422
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,800
and so this can continue until it

423
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
converges

424
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
and um this could be about

425
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
static things in the world or it could

426
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
be about dynamic things in the world

427
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,680
and the expectation maximization could

428
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,399
also be on

429
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,360
um causal things in the world and when

430
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
that inference is going to be about

431
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
action that's where action enters into

432
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,639
the loop because instead of just having

433
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,480
a data set and trying to converge on the

434
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,839
best descriptor

435
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
it's uh trying to converge on a policy

436
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,600
that could involve

437
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
hidden aspects of the world so let's go

438
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
a little bit more into detail in this

439
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
generative models and processes

440
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
generative models and generative

441
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,160
processes and active inference idea

442
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,120
because

443
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
i don't think this uh person's blog has

444
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,560
been

445
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
on here chuck tutorial on active

446
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
inference some really nice images

447
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,519
so here on the left is this idea that a

448
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,279
generative process which has a true

449
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,000
hidden state

450
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,199
s is emitting observations which

451
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,760
are modeled by some p function but its

452
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,519
observations are being emitted

453
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
from the world and the niche is really

454
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
the generative process that leads to

455
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
those observations

456
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
like the sky emits the sun and the moon

457
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,639
or the ecology

458
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,839
emits this rainfall or something then

459
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,560
on the other side of the blanket we have

460
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,760
the organism

461
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
which is embodying and enacting a

462
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,199
generative model

463
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,839
of those observations so that's like

464
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,560
your brain

465
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
predicting what the retina would see

466
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
well how do we know that the brain is

467
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
predicting what we would see there's no

468
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
blind spot

469
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,959
it has usual under healthy conditions

470
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
equal clarity everywhere and equal color

471
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,959
vision everywhere

472
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
and that's just not uh concordant with

473
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
the actual distribution of cells on the

474
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,800
retina

475
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
so really it's like upgraded resolution

476
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,000
at your periphery

477
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
that's an illusion based upon the

478
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
generation of the assumption

479
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
that things are actually equally clear

480
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
outside of your perception so it doesn't

481
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,480
uh have the same actual experience

482
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
uh characteristics as what you'd expect

483
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,560
in the retina

484
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,240
just you know interesting things and you

485
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,160
can imagine that for other senses too

486
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,519
so the organisms enacting this

487
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
generative model of those observations

488
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,880
and then the surprise or the residual of

489
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,240
those predictions is kind of getting

490
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
passed upwards into these models

491
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
and that's changing how the model of the

492
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,600
organism

493
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
in this bayesian framework here is

494
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
uh modeling these observations so the

495
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
organism has a generative model or is a

496
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,839
generative model depending on how you

497
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,720
think about it

498
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
of the niche which is what facilitates

499
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
action if your model of the circadian

500
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:40,880
rhythm

501
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,839
is 18 hours and it's 24 hours for the

502
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
real thing to happen

503
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
then your niche your temporal modeling

504
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,399
is off

505
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
and it's going to be pathological and

506
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
maladaptive or potentially not

507
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
that's where selection comes in

508
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
so here's another uh representation from

509
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,839
that same blog that

510
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,360
shows how now from that inference

511
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
process described here where the

512
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
organism has a generative model of

513
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
inference on those observations

514
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
in the world so i'm predicting what

515
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
observations on bitcoin price i'm going

516
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,040
to see

517
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
emitted by the true generative model now

518
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,240
i don't know what the generative model

519
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,120
is but i can

520
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
see the observations the organism

521
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
has preferences for certain observations

522
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
so here the darker

523
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
circle is representing preferable

524
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,360
observations

525
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
so the observations in this case are

526
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
enteroceptive which is really

527
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,279
nice and um the organism has a

528
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
preference for let's just say

529
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,279
in this categorical example one outcome

530
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:39,759
of the

531
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,480
observations over the other the gray one

532
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
and now

533
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
we can make a two by two matrix with the

534
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,320
two possible observations of the world

535
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
with a preference over them and the

536
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
state of the world which can't be

537
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
directly perceived which is whether the

538
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
stomach is empty or full

539
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,480
this isn't a physiological uh debate

540
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,759
it's just that's the simple

541
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,040
case here and that relies on this

542
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
a matrix which is the probability of

543
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,959
observations of

544
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
the world which is the data

545
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,079
given the states which can't be directly

546
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
experienced which is the stomach

547
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,679
that's the a matrix then the b matrix

548
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,119
maps a policy in the prior states

549
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
to the way in which the hidden states

550
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
are expected to change through time and

551
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
you can evaluate it for different b's

552
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
so here there's two possible u's which

553
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,480
are policies

554
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
eat or do nothing so

555
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,799
under under each policy eating or doing

556
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,280
nothing

557
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
which are represented by two different

558
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
matrices b1 and b2

559
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
the state at time t is like the current

560
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,559
moment

561
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
and in the state at time t plus one is

562
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
this day at the next moment

563
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
so there can be mappings between the

564
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
present and the future

565
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,559
conditioned on policy that's the

566
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,679
probability

567
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,120
basically of the state uh right now

568
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
given the state in the past and a policy

569
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
so that's phrased from like past to now

570
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,280
and this is about now to the next step

571
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
and here is the graphical representation

572
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
through time so t minus one is the past

573
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
t is the present moment and t plus one

574
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,559
is the future so the actual state of the

575
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,400
world is evolving under a certain

576
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
dynamic and it's emitting observations

577
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,799
and then under multiple possible policy

578
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,080
trajectories policies uh parameters or

579
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
different policies that can be

580
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,640
enacted and embodied what is being

581
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
estimated

582
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
is this relationship from how previous

583
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,760
states

584
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,080
of the policy influenced or were

585
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
associated with this true state

586
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,760
of the world at the current moment in

587
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
this layout

588
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,960
and how that observation then influences

589
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,240
uh the updating of the policies in

590
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
uh relative comparison for the current

591
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,559
moment moving forward

592
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,799
under a generative model of the action

593
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
of action in the niche by the organism

594
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
all right big five psychology so the big

595
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,799
five are dimensions of variation

596
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
that are statistical and usually from

597
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,799
self-reported surveys that are based

598
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
upon basically personality differences

599
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
in the population

600
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
so it's a dimension of variability in

601
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
populations

602
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
kind of like the trait of heritability

603
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
from quantitative genetics

604
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
so it's a measure of variance explained

605
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,720
on a certain population sample

606
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
it's not a causal model of traits nor is

607
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
it a fraction due to genetic

608
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
causes even though that fallacy is made

609
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
throughout the literature

610
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
so the big five is based upon the use of

611
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
statistical methods

612
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
basically correlation matrices and

613
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
principle component analyses

614
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
on survey data that finds patterns

615
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
across questions and participants

616
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
and the acronym for big five is ocean

617
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,760
so here's an example of how the big five

618
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
are calculated and then what the oceans

619
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
stand for

620
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
so what will happen will be that a bunch

621
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
of participants are

622
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,799
asked a survey or are scored through

623
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,520
some

624
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
way and this survey may have a hundred

625
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,280
questions or a certain

626
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
different number of questions and that

627
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,320
corresponds to

628
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,520
a hundred dimensions of data it's an 100

629
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
dimensional vector per person

630
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
so the total survey study design can be

631
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,120
um just the columns are the people and

632
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
the rows are

633
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,640
the questions and how they answered and

634
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
so that's a simple

635
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
matrix that can be given all the data of

636
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
that entire survey

637
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
and some statistical techniques are used

638
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,720
on that

639
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
matrix and like a principal component

640
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
analysis

641
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,320
and it according to the psychology

642
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,039
literature

643
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,159
falls out into these five large axes of

644
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,080
variation so when we do the pca

645
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
the algorithm is not told specifically

646
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,679
which questions are expected to be

647
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,799
correlated with

648
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
or negatively or positively with other

649
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,320
questions

650
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,840
but because there are actual statistical

651
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,960
regularities in certain

652
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
pairs of questions or sets of questions

653
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
in the real world in terms of how people

654
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
answer things for example a question and

655
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
its negation should have a negative

656
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,440
correlation

657
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
um as well as other relationships in the

658
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
world uh it's possible to find the

659
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
structure of some of these

660
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
uh dimensions that map very well on

661
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
these dimensions of variability

662
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,080
in the data and so the five big axes of

663
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,720
variation

664
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,679
are openness to experience the axis

665
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,200
between inventive and curious versus

666
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
consistent consciousness

667
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
conscientiousness extroversion

668
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
agreeableness in neuroticism or ocean

669
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,679
and uh i uh hesitate to go too much into

670
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,720
the adjective

671
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
side because those are always very

672
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
english language dependent

673
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
and really it's about the structure of

674
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,039
the data in the real

675
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,039
observations and here's just a few other

676
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
issues with

677
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,799
uh the topic of big five which is that

678
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
there's often population and survey

679
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
specific covariance structures

680
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
though some structures are quite well

681
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,799
correlated across different surveys

682
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
there's often a normative or a

683
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
culturally narrow

684
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,000
understanding of what personality is or

685
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,679
how it manifests and how it represents

686
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,320
itself

687
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
and also there's just this fundamental

688
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
difficulty in attaching the natural

689
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,159
language

690
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
words to these differences in the

691
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
manifold

692
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
um one way though that we can kind of

693
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,600
get out what these dimensions really are

694
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
is by looking at the questions that are

695
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
very highly correlated with each of

696
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,400
these axes

697
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
so for openness a few questions i drew

698
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
three questions from each of the

699
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
letters is i'm quick to understand

700
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,080
things

701
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
i like to try new things i have a good

702
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,360
imagination

703
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
c conscientiousness is i'm always

704
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,440
prepared i pay attention to details i

705
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,559
like order

706
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,559
extra version e is i am the life of the

707
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,799
party i feel comfortable around people

708
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,000
i start conversations a agreeableness is

709
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,559
i take time out for others i feel others

710
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,280
emotions

711
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
i make people feel at ease neuroticism n

712
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,960
is i get upset easily i have frequent

713
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
mood swings

714
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
and i worry about things such as in my

715
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,919
life

716
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,960
and one interesting note on this paper

717
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,760
and definitely

718
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,039
a little fun fact

719
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,720
is that um one can do a vector

720
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,880
decomposition on the big five to reveal

721
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
these additional aspects of personality

722
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,159
beyond those five

723
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,919
principle structurings that's of course

724
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
graining to a very

725
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
high degree and this is going to go one

726
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
layer chiseling down into the

727
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,679
statistical variability structure

728
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,000
and this paper i was searching in my

729
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
library for it because i

730
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
thought it was an interesting one and i

731
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
remembered it and it turned out that

732
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
it was actually the author of this paper

733
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,960
from 13

734
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
14 years ago with jordan peterson yes

735
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,919
that jordan peterson and it draws

736
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,679
somewhat on this idea of vector

737
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
decomposition but statistical vector

738
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,200
decomposition

739
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
and just as refresher uh two vectors can

740
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
be added

741
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
kind of head to tail and they end up at

742
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,360
the same

743
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
place no matter which way you add them

744
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
just like

745
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
regular numbers like two plus three

746
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
equals five and three plus two equals

747
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
five

748
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
so they took the five

749
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,120
big dimensions and broke them down the

750
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,799
the blue and the red arrows they they

751
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,200
don't

752
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
up and the down they don't represent

753
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,480
anything about the trait characteristic

754
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,919
it's just using the same example of

755
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,400
vector addition it's breaking down

756
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,279
a statistical dimension into another

757
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,640
axis of variability

758
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
which is a pretty cool technique and

759
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
it's going to relate in the paper that

760
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,200
we're going to discuss

761
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
to the ways to get at very fine-grained

762
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,840
aspects of the high-dimensional space

763
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,200
that represents action

764
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,880
propensities cybernetics is uh it's not

765
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
the first time we've had cybernetics as

766
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,799
a keyword on the active stream

767
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
but each time we do want to kind of see

768
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
it a little bit differently

769
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
so the image on the left is a brain with

770
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
a bunch of wires and kind of represents

771
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,440
this crossover

772
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,320
mind machine mapping is it an analogy is

773
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,760
it an interface

774
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,720
is it a vision is it is it a prophecy

775
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
all these different things that mind and

776
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
machine can be

777
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,720
is kind of captured in cybernetics

778
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
culturally but also on the right side

779
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,360
is a more formal systems diagram

780
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
approach to cybernetics which describes

781
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,559
kind of first and second order

782
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,360
cybernetic

783
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
systems and here is from this cybersoft

784
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
post down on the bottom they wrote

785
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,080
the basic idea of cybernetics is that

786
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
complex systems such as living organisms

787
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
societies and brains are self-regulated

788
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
by the feedback of information

789
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
by systematically analyzing the feedback

790
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
mechanisms which regulate complex

791
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,400
systems

792
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,159
cybernetics hopes to discover the means

793
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,279
of controlling these systems

794
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,080
technologically

795
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
and to develop the capability of

796
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
synthesizing artificial systems

797
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,159
with similar capacities there's a few

798
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,080
other parts about cybernetics that are

799
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,960
interesting

800
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
because it has had quite its own history

801
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,039
and it's uh related to complex system

802
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,080
study but there's some interesting

803
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
history so here's a few

804
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
more quotes from this article they write

805
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
the word cybernetics was coined by the

806
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
mit

807
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,279
mathematician norbert weiner in the

808
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,360
summer of 1947 to refer to the new

809
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
science of command and control in

810
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
animals machines

811
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,919
which he helped to establish and develop

812
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
the word was developed derived from the

813
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,039
greek kubernetes

814
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,520
meaning steersman or ship pilot unknown

815
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,720
to weiner at the time

816
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,679
plato had used the adjective kubernetes

817
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,760
in the gorgius to refer to the science

818
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,559
of piloting

819
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,200
and the french physicist marie ampari

820
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,279
had derived the french word cybernetic

821
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,279
direct directly from the greek to refer

822
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,640
to the science of government

823
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
in his classification of sciences and so

824
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,960
the word kuber leads us straight to

825
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,520
governor

826
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
the regulator guide and pilot of steam

827
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
engines and states

828
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
it thus lies at a powerful metaphorical

829
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
intersection of political economy and

830
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
technology

831
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
social and material order and the

832
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,320
regulation of animals and machines

833
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,760
and then another quotation that was

834
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
pretty interesting from the end of this

835
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
article was when donna haraway

836
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,679
challenged feminists and leftists to

837
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,600
embrace the language and metaphysics of

838
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
cybernetics what was she aiming at

839
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
was the cyborg just another metaphor for

840
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,679
hybridity

841
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
if it was then why was she so insistent

842
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
on adopting not only the terminology of

843
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,679
cybernetics systems and information but

844
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,200
its whole ontology

845
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,760
no this was not mere rhetoric this was

846
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,919
this move was political and it was savvy

847
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,440
wise and insightful

848
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
for haraway shows us it is not just the

849
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,399
world the environment that is cybernetic

850
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,720
we are cybernetic we are cyberworks

851
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,080
cybernetic organisms

852
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
we are hybrids made up of organic beings

853
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,760
and mechanical parts

854
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
and the only thing that ties us all

855
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
together you and me you and other parts

856
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
of you is information

857
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
fundamentally cybernetics is a new

858
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,679
ontology andy pickering has called it

859
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
an ontology of becoming the universe is

860
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,679
not made up of matter

861
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,399
particles or energy nor is it made up of

862
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,159
ideas words and symbols

863
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
it is not numerals or universals or

864
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,320
plenum or atoms or modads

865
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
the world is made up to feedback loops

866
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
of information

867
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
so pretty cool quote

868
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,200
cybernetic big five theory cb5t is a

869
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,679
line of research pursued by one of the

870
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,120
co-authors of this

871
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,640
paper primarily colin deung and it uses

872
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
cybernetics

873
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,960
as the name might suggest to integrate

874
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,440
the dynamics of personality and get at

875
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,120
potential mechanisms amongst other

876
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,840
things

877
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
and the highlights from the 2015 paper

878
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,399
which is cited in the 2020 paper

879
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,120
they write cybernetic big five theory is

880
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
a new integrative theory

881
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
of personality personality traits

882
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,080

883
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
cybernetic mechanisms

884
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
characteristic adaptations which is a

885
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
term from cybernetics our goals

886
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
interpretations and strategies in

887
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,279
updateable memory specific mechanisms

888
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,720

implications for pathophysiology

psychophysiology

892
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
and well-being are discussed and this

893
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,279
was a figure

894
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,679
from the young 2015 paper but it's

895
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,720
actually drawn

896
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,919
from jordan peterson's 1999 book maps of

897
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:06,960
meaning

898
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
and here's how it is in the book slash

899
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,039
paper

900
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,840
where at any given state there's the

901
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,200
current state of the world

902
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,720
and strategies are being implemented to

903
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
attain desired states or goals then

904
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
anomalous information is always entering

905
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,840
the picture from chaos entropy the

906
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
unknown

907
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
at some point the current state of the

908
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
world given the strategies and the

909
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,399
desired goals

910
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,440
can no longer keep the integration

911
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,159
process

912
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
maintained the center cannot hoddle and

913
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,559
there's a disintegration

914
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,840
process that leads to a state of chaos

915
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,159
in the entropy in the unknown

916
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,120
followed by a reintegration because you

917
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,760
can only

918
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
have a reintegration from disorder to

919
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
order you can only reintegrate even if

920
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
it's a very similar state

921
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,440
because it's still an accessible one

922
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,039
even if it's a similar one it still is a

923
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,159
reintegration

924
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
and if the world state has changed that

925
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,360
means the niche is different which means

926
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,120
the reintegration must be different

927
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,559
so i thought it was kind of interesting

928
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,799
to map this onto a few other ideas from

929
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,240
active and other things we've

930
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,399
sorry that we've talked about in the

931
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,279
streams

932
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,039
so first there's the dividing line

933
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,039
between order and disorder which

934
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,760
correlates to basically the blanket the

935
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
interface the whole thing we're talking

936
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,799
about with the self-organizational

937
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,600
systems

938
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,000
because that boundary between the agent

939
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
and the niche

940
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,880
again is not just an informational one

941
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,120
it's also an info thermodynamic one

942
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,520
so the agent is where organization is

943
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
happening for example

944
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,120
the uh person in their apartment is

945
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
eating food

946
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,559
and they're organizing biological matter

947
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
radiating heat they could be getting

948
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,320
more organized making more organized

949
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,480
tissue of any kind depending on their

950
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,840
hormonal state

951
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,399
and then depending on that the room is

952
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,760
going to be warming up and there's going

953
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,159
to be

954
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,600
heat released in the supply chain so

955
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,960
that's actually like a thermodynamic

956
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,520
boundary

957
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,440
as well as an information one and we can

958
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
think about these

959
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
preferences over different observed

960
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
outcomes of the world

961
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,679
as being akin to goals peterson's

962
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,200
framework here is still

963
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
very reward oriented rather than

964
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,360
precision oriented that does enter the

965
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,399
picture here we'll get to that in a

966
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,200
second

967
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
the strategy is like policies which

968
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,720
truly are strategies

969
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,320
and the current state of the world and

970
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,159
the interpretation are like hidden state

971
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,880
estimates

972
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,600
which could be like is my career stable

973
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,679
or will things be okay with this

974
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,399
thing of the world so the current given

975
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:28,799
current

976
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
understandings of the world which can be

977
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
accurate or not helpful or not two by

978
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
two

979
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
and given strategies being implemented

980
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,720
which is like the field of affordances

981
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,080
and active inference

982
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
are organisms attaining their preferred

983
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
states their desired states of the world

984
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,519
and in the framework of peterson as well

985
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,039
as an active inference anomalous

986
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
information is continually

987
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
not just occasionally entering into the

988
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
picture so it's always a question of

989
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
resiliency and of self-organization

990
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,279
around anomalous information being

991
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,559
integrated because

992
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,120
no uh model is going to be perfectly

993
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
predicting it's about

994
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
incorporating the variability into a

995
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
healthy and

996
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,159
resilient model and here it's like

997
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,760
surprise being passed from the

998
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,720
environment

999
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,799
through the interface to the organism

1000
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,679
and the organism can disintegrate and

1001
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,559
enter into

1002
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,760
potentially a pathological region or a

1003
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
strange attractor state that could

1004
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
re-integrate or re-stabilize in a newer

1005
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,240
different niche

1006
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,279
into another different state policy

1007
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,240
preference

1008
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,760
combination and this

1009
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,279
encounter with chaos which could be the

1010
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,120
dark knight of the soul or the hero's

1011
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,600
journey

1012
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,399
or alchemy or phase transitions of the

1013
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,279
self

1014
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
that's an interesting thing to think

1015
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
about with the self organization and the

1016
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,559
reorganization reintegration of

1017
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,679
societies

1018
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,720
cities teams relationships individuals

1019
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,200
another thing that is mentioned in the

1020
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,720
paper but it wasn't keyword

1021
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,919
was spm which is statistical parametric

1022
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,799
mapping spm so here's from the spm

1023
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,279
website whose url is on the bottom

1024
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,240
it says spm12 first released first of

1025
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
october 2014

1026
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,120
but previous versions of spm have been

1027
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,519
released for many years and last updated

1028
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
on the 13th of january 2020

1029
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,159
so almost one year old at this point is

1030
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,480
a major update to the spm software

1031
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
containing substantial theoretical

1032
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,679
algorithmic structural and interface

1033
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
enhancements over previous versions

1034
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,799
cool what is spm spm

1035
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,320
is a software package that has been

1036
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,080
designed for the analysis

1037
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,919
of basically brain imaging data

1038
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,519
sequences but it turns out that that's a

1039
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,320
quite general

1040
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
question for a lot of reasons which

1041
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
we'll discuss a few of right now

1042
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,240
so what spm does is it starts with a

1043
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,039
series of

1044
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
images that are from various types of

1045
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,440
experimental designs

1046
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
it could be from similar or different

1047
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,559
cohorts or it could be

1048
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
different kinds of time series from one

1049
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,919
subject

1050
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,320
and the current release is designed for

1051
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,960
the integrated analysis of fmri

1052
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,799
pet spect eeg and meg so the most

1053
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,239
common interfaces for neuro imaging

1054
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,480
are incorporated uh despite their

1055
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,399
usually extremely different error

1056
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,440
profile

1057
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,839
and actually uh representing quite

1058
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
different aspects of the tissue

1059
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
being imaged and over different time

1060
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,679
scales with different accuracies so

1061
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,599
it's quite a general question to

1062
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,520
integrate different kinds of time series

1063
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,760
into underlying generative models of

1064
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,119
extremely specific

1065
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,839
types what is the statistical parametric

1066
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,079
map it is the construction and the

1067
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,800
assessment

1068
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,440
of a spatially extended statistical

1069
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
process so a

1070
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
statistical process that happens through

1071
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,320
time and space

1072
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,800
that is used to test hypotheses about

1073
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
functional imaging data

1074
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,599
so there's like the map and the

1075
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
territory that's the mapping is kind of

1076
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
that two layer the data to the

1077
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,119
underlying model that's the mapping

1078
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,440
and then it's a statistical parametric

1079
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,240
mapping

1080
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,960
so like a p-value comes from a z-score

1081
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,079
or t-score

1082
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
or some other type of variable that's a

1083
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
statistical parameter

1084
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,240
and so it's going to be like an

1085
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,880
underlying statistical test and

1086
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
it's related to a lot of different kinds

1087
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,920
of data

1088
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,440
and this spm textbook from 2007

1089
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
is uh quite a mathematical read

1090
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,839
maybe it or a later wikipedia

1091
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,560
version of the spm toolkit could be

1092
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,320
interesting to have a math

1093
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,119
set of discussions but we have this one

1094
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
at home and it's a classic

1095
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
it's a true true classic here's just

1096
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
a summary of what spm does so that

1097
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,440
the key aspects can be seen in this is

1098
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,560
what fristen

1099
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,320
for years before becoming more popular

1100
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,520
in the machine learning and uh theory of

1101
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,000
everything

1102
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,119
and philosophy of everything universe

1103
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,240
uh many years before that he was and

1104
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,960
still is

1105
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,520
the most cited neuroscientist and the

1106
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,079
huge

1107
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
reason for that is the many many papers

1108
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
that have gone into this type of

1109
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,520
development and then also its use as a

1110
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,079
toolkit

1111
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,480
broadly by many communities so the way

1112
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,839
that it begins with

1113
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,800
the spm is taking in the data which

1114
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,680
represents

1115
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,440
slices of different underlying objects

1116
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,359
so it can be attained measured in

1117
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,800
various different ways whether it's all

1118
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
the measurements simultaneously

1119
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
or whether the slices take time as they

1120
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
slice through a system

1121
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,760
and that is first done uh there's an

1122
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,240
inter

1123
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
first processing step that's basically a

1124
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,359
realignment to

1125
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,920
a standardized brain atlas or a

1126
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,400
person-specific brain atlas for example

1127
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,640
so you can take a static image that has

1128
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
much higher resolution and align

1129
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,359
dynamical images

1130
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,599
or not to this more static high

1131
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,119
resolution image which can help a huge

1132
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,320
amount

1133
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,839
that is then processed through smoothing

1134
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,079
which is like this thing called a kernel

1135
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,760
which is like you have a fabric which is

1136
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,800
the data and there's going to be like a

1137
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
finger and it's going to move across the

1138
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
data and re-weight the data

1139
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
according to some smoothing technique

1140
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,160
and

1141
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
this represents a gaussian kernel so

1142
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,359
this is just

1143
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,640
blurring the image to ease out a little

1144
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,400
bit over the noise at a certain

1145
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,640
spatial and temporal scale that can also

1146
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,680
be related to

1147
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,040
specific instrumentation related biases

1148
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,000
that are known

1149
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
like non-linearities in the response and

1150
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,040
that

1151
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,320
is this process um where the the data

1152
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,640
are

1153
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
processed into um a cleanly comparable

1154
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,599
format spatially and temporally and

1155
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,599
statistically renormalized

1156
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,920
then there is the specification of a

1157
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,680
design matrix which there's so many of

1158
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
these in the spm textbook it's really

1159
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,359
awesome and they look really beautiful

1160
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,280
and the design matrices are uh

1161
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,480
very broadly types of things that you

1162
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
want to consider in your analysis

1163
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,839
whether it's something you know about

1164
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,480
the patient like their age

1165
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,040
or their pathological diagnosis whether

1166
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,240
it's something you know about them

1167
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,839
and you want to include it in the model

1168
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,359
or not uh

1169
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,200
as in as something you're predicting or

1170
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,560
including in your prediction of

1171
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
something else

1172
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,599
or whether the design matrix includes

1173
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,000
other more esoteric components that are

1174
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
often discussed in this spm textbook

1175
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,640
like

1176
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,839
these time kernels that design matrix

1177
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,359
and the smooth brain image sequences are

1178
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,920
put together into a general linear model

1179
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,079
and it's funny because you hear a lot of

1180
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,640
disdain for linear models but this is

1181
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,599
linear models

1182
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,200
in a extremely rigorous and non-linear

1183
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,599
way

1184
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,320
that can lead to these parameter

1185
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,880
estimates

1186
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,280
because it's like a linear model on a

1187
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,079
space

1188
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,520
that's been warped by this

1189
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,200
prior and updates in a multi-scale way

1190
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
so that's really the interesting part is

1191
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
it takes renormalization to the next

1192
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,440
level

1193
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,520
and then applies general linear models

1194
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,440
in an extremely specific way

1195
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,400
though i don't understand all the

1196
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,720
details that relates to

1197
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,119
what is called a statistical parametric

1198
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,000
map

1199
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,520
which is here like a heat map of um

1200
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,880
the uh the score of that

1201
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
voxel so that's like the z score so like

1202
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,320
a z

1203
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
score of two or two standard deviations

1204
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
above the mean

1205
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,440
or one or whatever it happens to be it's

1206
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,079
like a z-score positive and negative

1207
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,800
and then there's a variety of approaches

1208
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
that can be used

1209
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,119
to then on this statistical parametric

1210
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,400
map

1211
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,839
draw p-value

1212
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,480
distinctions on this and it turns out

1213
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,119
that that

1214
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
process of setting a p-value threshold

1215
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,960
and saying whether 80 of the brain is

1216
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,119
used in a task or one percent or

1217
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,960
correct for one person's structure but

1218
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
you're trying to detect the structure

1219
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,480
that area is an extremely nuanced field

1220
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
no pun intended and it draws on this

1221
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,160
random field theory and there's several

1222
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,079
chapters in the spm textbook that do

1223
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,520
random field theory

1224
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
and it was just like quite an

1225
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,760
interesting approach to statistics that

1226
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,560
is uh really being implemented here all

1227
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
right the abstract of the paper is that

1228
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,480
cybernetics is a study of goal-directed

1229
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
systems that self-regulate via feedback

1230
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,839
a category that includes human beings

1231
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,520
cybernetic big five theory attempts to

1232
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,680
explain personality in cybernetic terms

1233
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
conceptualizing personality traits as

1234
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,520
manifestations

1235
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,200
a variation in parameters of the neural

1236
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,119
mechanisms that evolve to facilitate

1237
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,800
cybernetic control

1238
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,319
the free energy principle in active

1239
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,640
inference framework fep ai

1240
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,839
is an overarching approach for

1241
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,359
understanding how it is that complex

1242
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,200
systems manage to persist in a world

1243
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,480
governed by the second law of

1244
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,599
thermodynamics

1245
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,240
the inevitable tendency towards entropy

1246
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,920
so the authors have framed

1247
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
the conversation as being firstly about

1248
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,280
cybernetics

1249
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,839
first word that's about action selection

1250
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
in complex systems that self-regulate

1251
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,640
and use feedback

1252
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,079
big field then within the context of the

1253
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,319
cybernetic big five theory which this is

1254
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,640
a psychological theory that draws

1255
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,319
heavily on cybernetics

1256
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,200
we are going to consider the neural

1257
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
mechanisms that facilitate

1258
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,319
and have evolved to facilitate this kind

1259
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,240
of cybernetic control

1260
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,599
then the free energy principle and

1261
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,720
active inference framework are

1262
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,760
introduced

1263
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,200
um to explain a similar set of topics

1264
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,839
behavior as well as this resistance of

1265
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,800
dissolution

1266
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,280
far from equilibrium systems although

1267
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,960
these two cybernetic theories

1268
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,480
were developed independently they

1269
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
overlap in their theoretical foundations

1270
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,280
and implications

1271
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,400
and are complementary in their

1272
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,800
approaches to understanding persons

1273
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
fep ai contributes a potentially

1274
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
valuable formal modeling framework for

1275
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,680
cb5t

1276
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
while cb5t provides details about the

1277
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,079
science and structure of personality

1278
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,359
in this chapter we explore how cb5t and

1279
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,640
fepai

1280
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,400
may begin to be integrated into a

1281
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
unified approach to modeling

1282
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,240
persons we'll need another acronym won't

1283
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,520
we

1284
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,040
so the roadmap the first section

1285
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,440
is a cybernetic approach to personality

1286
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,960
and has the first figure

1287
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,280
which shows some of the causal processes

1288
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
that are related to the functioning of

1289
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,520
personality of the individual

1290
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,480
the second section is the free energy

1291
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
principle and cb5t

1292
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,040
third is predictive processing and

1293
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,960
personality neuroscience

1294
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,040
active inference generative models and

1295
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,480
personality modeling

1296
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,319
there's two figures in that section

1297
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,000
which draw upon

1298
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,839
the graphical models some of which we've

1299
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,680
seen some of the structure before

1300
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,119
and also the spm demo then in section

1301
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,160
six it talks about

1302
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,079
personality traits from the perspectives

1303
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,359
of cb5t

1304
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,640
and fep ai and there's a representation

1305
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,119
of the personality trait hierarchy

1306
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,359
and then the final three sections are

1307
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,480
the metatrades

1308
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,680
the big five personality traits

1309
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,520
then a conclusion on the levels of

1310
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
analysis in personality

1311
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,520
modeling table one then has some of the

1312
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,400
analogies

1313
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,280
between uh or mappings between cb 5t and

1314
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,880
fep ai so figure one

1315
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,920
in the paper is a uh drawn from another

1316
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,079
paper and it relates to the causal

1317
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,119
processes

1318
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,119
that are involved in the functioning of

1319
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,359
personality within an individual

1320
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,280
and so it's a pretty uh loose

1321
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
chart saying that both genes and

1322
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,720
environment

1323
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,960
play into these relatively stable

1324
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
parameters of cybernetic mechanisms

1325
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,480
so that's saying somebody who has uh

1326
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,599
these are uh cybernetic underlying

1327
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,240
features like given a certain attractor

1328
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,359
state some people may

1329
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,359
spiral towards it or spiral away from it

1330
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,160
or stay in a certain stable orbit to it

1331
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,599
and that is the cybernetics of

1332
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,079
biological systems that maps onto

1333
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,920
personality trait architectures

1334
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,000
statistically in matrices

1335
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,599
because there's this underlying

1336
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
statistical regularity in the world

1337
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,079
and that leads to a feedback system with

1338
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,440
stigma g perhaps

1339
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,760
of characteristic adaptations and life

1340
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,960
outcomes and that's why there's

1341
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,319
correlations between

1342
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,000
life outcomes and personality traits and

1343
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
it's hard to determine cause and effect

1344
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,400
and

1345
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,079
all these other aspects of it

1346
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,640
figure two is pretty nice it's the

1347
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
authors redrawing i believe

1348
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
of the graphical model structure that

1349
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,400
we've seen a lot of

1350
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,160
but i wanted to read a quotation from

1351
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,839
page 21 because they

1352
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,040
laid it out very nicely they wrote

1353
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
generative modeling in fep ai can be

1354
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
complex but the basic setup

1355
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,960
involves specifying agents and their

1356
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
situations as systems of interacting

1357
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,720
variables and parameters

1358
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,160
these variables take the form of

1359
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,240
mutually referencing matrices whose

1360
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,880
entries

1361
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,960
specify probabilistic mappings between

1362
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,400
different portions of the generative

1363
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,960
model

1364
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,319
nice as we previously described a single

1365
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,839
objective function of

1366
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,960
expected free energy is used that's g to

1367
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,200
determine which policies are selected

1368
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,000
according to whichever actions are in to

1369
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,359
determine which policies are selected

1370
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,960
that's pi

1371
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
uh according to whichever actions are

1372
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
anticipated to minimize overall

1373
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
prediction error

1374
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,319
an example fep ai generative model may

1375
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,760
include the following matrices where

1376
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
each mapping is conditional upon the

1377
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
probabilistic mappings from

1378
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,839
preceding matrices a a matrix is the

1379
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,560
likelihood

1380
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,079
mapping from latent world states to

1381
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,000
sensory observations or how sensations

1382
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,359
are interpreted via perception and

1383
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,240
imagination

1384
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,599
from the agent's perspective this would

1385
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,440
correspond to answering the question

1386
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,960
what is likely to have caused my

1387
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,359
sensations the b matrix is the

1388
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,800
transition probabilities

1389
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,760
or how dynamics are expected to evolve

1390
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,359
from one moment to the next from the

1391
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,400
agent's perspective this would

1392
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,920
correspond to answering the question

1393
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,280
how do i believe things are likely to

1394
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
change through time three c

1395
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,680
matrix the c matrix is the prior beliefs

1396
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,359
over policies or outcomes or which

1397
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,119
states an agent predicts itself

1398
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,160
occupying

1399
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
via mechanisms of prediction error

1400
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,000
minimization these prior expectations

1401
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,680
constitute the attracting states of the

1402
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
system and function as preferences

1403
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,839
from the agent's perspective this would

1404
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,520
correspond to answering the question

1405
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,079
where or what do i want to happen and

1406
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,119
thereby doing

1407
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,720
slash enacting it through active

1408
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,640
inference in the ways described above

1409
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
from a cb5t these preferences are an

1410
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,240
agent's high level goals

1411
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,440
four the d matrix the d matrix is an

1412
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,880
agent's belief regarding its initial

1413
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,079
position within the decision

1414
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,079
environment from the agent's perspective

1415
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,520
this would correspond to answering the

1416
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:17,920
question

1417
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,440
where am i likely to be in this kind of

1418
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,960
situation or where am i likely to have

1419
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,160
started

1420
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,920
the n5 the e matrix the e matrix is the

1421
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,839
baseline prior over policies governing

1422
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,599
policy selection in a habitual or

1423
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,200
heuristic fashion from the agent's

1424
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,160
perspective

1425
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,680
this would correspond to answering the

1426
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,200
question what am i likely to be doing

1427
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,839
right now

1428
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,520
and thereby doing slash and acting

1429
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,040
through active inference but with

1430
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,480
actions deployed in a fashion that

1431
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,680
ignores uncertainty

1432
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
with respect to the likelihood of goal

1433
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
attainment in a particular situation

1434
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,000
from a cb5t perspective these habit

1435
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
priors would constitute a major class of

1436
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,319
characteristic adaptations

1437
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,240
pretty nice then you have the states and

1438
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,000
observations and then

1439
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,680
the beta and the gamma which is the

1440
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,200
precision uh

1441
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,119
estimators which is the confidence in

1442
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,319
the temperature parameter

1443
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,520
over that confidence so very nicely laid

1444
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,880
out by the authors

1445
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,359
and always uh cool to hear it a

1446
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,440
different way and framed as a catechism

1447
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,400
which is actually like

1448
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
what does each matrix represent the

1449
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
question uh

1450
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,760
what is the question that reflects how

1451
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
each matrix is answering something in

1452
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,000
the model

1453
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,280
doing something in the model figure 3

1454
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,960
is an illustrative figure accompanying a

1455
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,559
generative modeling demo that is

1456
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,559
pre-packaged with spm-12

1457
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,319
this particular simulation involved

1458
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,319
modeling curiosity with respect to a

1459
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,839
task with unknown rules

1460
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,520
where agents attempted to maximize

1461
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,599
valued outcomes while also needing to

1462
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,160
discover

1463
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,559
the latent task structure and the

1464
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,599
generative

1465
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,200
patterns of the data that are part of

1466
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,040
this integrated generative model in

1467
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,920
spm include the inferred rules of the

1468
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,960
world

1469
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,800
the top left the patterns of the task

1470
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
choices here

1471
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,040
and the neuronal activity anticipated to

1472
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,680
occur

1473
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,520
based upon mechanistic process theories

1474
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,280
associated with fep ai

1475
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,200
bottom left in all these three so unit

1476
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,040
firing firing rates

1477
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
local field potentials and dopamine

1478
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,160
responses as

1479
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,800
a function of these things happening

1480
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,599
under this

1481
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,119
rule and choice so it's policy behavior

1482
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,240
and neural or underlying uh responses

1483
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,359
which can be of

1484
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,960
various categories from the neuro

1485
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,559
metabolic like dopamine

1486
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,119
to the firing the local field potentials

1487
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:23,839
so

1488
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,800
it's quite a broad modeling framework

1489
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,520
figure four

1490
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,400
is the personality trait hierarchy and

1491
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,119
they write

1492
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,640
note that the structure indicated here

1493
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,079
is the between person covariance

1494
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,839
structure of traits in the population

1495
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,880
not within person causal structure so

1496
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,359
in other words these connections reflect

1497
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,720
ways that you can partition

1498
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,280
axes of variability not like there's

1499
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,559
some sort of downward

1500
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,960
cause so that's sort of the challenge

1501
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,079
with this naming

1502
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,119
of these things is that they're all kind

1503
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,800
of like adjectives they're all they all

1504
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,040
seem like they're equal adjectives

1505
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,119
um i mean some might have a more

1506
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,200
negative or positive connotation or

1507
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,280
preference for some people but they're

1508
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,640
all just adjectives

1509
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
and yet really it's a specific

1510
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,240
statistical structure

1511
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,400
where the connections don't really

1512
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,280
reflect

1513
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
relationships they're sub-components

1514
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,319
that are

1515
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,920
distinct under another sub component of

1516
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,839
a population variability

1517
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,599
so it's really better just to think

1518
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
about what the real question

1519
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,920
is and what this statistical structure

1520
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,720
is doing

1521
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,960
because the adjective part i just don't

1522
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,480
really know how

1523
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,400
good of an approach that is and then

1524
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,240
also the piece of the niche

1525
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,559
is that eco evo devo so ecology

1526
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,240
evolution and development

1527
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,559
are what structure those stability and

1528
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,400
plasticity metatrades

1529
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,480
because the ants that we see today for

1530
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,440
example

1531
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,119
they've been on a lineage that's been

1532
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,760
successful since the beginning of ants

1533
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,359
and back even further so it has had to

1534
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,400
maintain

1535
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,640
some parameter values which have kept

1536
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,760
pace with

1537
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,720
changing local context so that's what

1538
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,520
structures

1539
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,720
these really specific top level traits

1540
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,240
because it's actually the process that

1541
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,319
structures the entire landscape that all

1542
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,040
these things are playing out upon

1543
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,960
table 1 shows some mappings between the

1544
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,599
key concepts in cb5t and their

1545
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,480
definitions

1546
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,880
and the free energy principle or active

1547
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,119
inference

1548
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,079
terms or related topics so cybernetics

1549
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:26,559
itself

1550
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,640
is about governing systems that

1551
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,240
self-regulate via feedback

1552
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,480
and that's related to many of the

1553
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,319
cybernetic underpinnings and also

1554
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,359
information theory and entropic aspects

1555
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:37,599
of

1556
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,720
fep psychological goals

1557
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,839
are representations in cybernetics

1558
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,359
that get enacted through action and fep

1559
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,359
they would say that that is a bayesian

1560
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,599
belief about the expectations

1561
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,599
of uh how prediction errors are going to

1562
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:55,839
be

1563
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,160
minimized so that's preferences via

1564
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,760
policy selection

1565
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,559
psychopathology is a persistent or maybe

1566
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,040
a

1567
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,440
self-diagnosed or not failure to move

1568
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,280
towards one's psychological goals due to

1569
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
failure to generate effective new goals

1570
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,280
over different time scales let's say and

1571
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,480
that could map

1572
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,040
in the fep to a persistent inability to

1573
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,960
minimize prediction error

1574
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,640
and there's a lot of interesting work on

1575
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,200
that in the second part of table one

1576
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,680
personality are the reasonably enduring

1577
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,960
psychological individual

1578
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,119
differences although also it would have

1579
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,960
to do with the ecological niche because

1580
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,800
it can't be defined abstract from the

1581
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,839
relationships and the

1582
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,720
experiments and then the fep active

1583
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,400
inference correspondence would be these

1584
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,760
enduring attractors

1585
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,599
that define systems as weakly ergodic

1586
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,760
processes so states that some systems

1587
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,119
revisit but others don't

1588
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,880
so some people return to a youtube

1589
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,200
channel or a tv channel or whatever

1590
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,040
and some people don't some people it

1591
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,480
never enters into their orbit

1592
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,440
and so that's why it's always

1593
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,800
conditional on what is being received

1594
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,160
from the niche

1595
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,319
those personality traits are those

1596
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,240
probabilistic descriptions of stable

1597
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,040
patterns

1598
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,760
within personality and their

1599
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,000
correspondence suggested for the fep is

1600
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,720
the minimal message length or the

1601
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,240
maximally informative

1602
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,079
descriptions of agents as generative

1603
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,680
models so this is like the parsimonious

1604
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,960
description

1605
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,400
of the agents representing their niche

1606
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,160
the characteristic adaptations are the

1607
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,599
stable goals interpretations and

1608
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,760
strategies specified in relation to

1609
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,680
basically the niche and that relates to

1610
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,839
this whole policy and adaptive component

1611
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,680
of fepai

1612
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,119
so that's basically it for this um

1613
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,319
video and a few questions to return to

1614
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,559
at the end questions that are often

1615
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,480
asked what would we really

1616
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,720
get at with a good framework here so

1617
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,520
what would a good framework enable

1618
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,760
what are the unique predictions and

1619
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,359
experiments of this model

1620
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,839
so what is our knowledge gain what are

1621
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,040
we getting out of

1622
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,400
this specific integration paper um

1623
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,000
and how is it going to influence not

1624
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,599
just how we think about the world

1625
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,359
but how we act in the world in terms of

1626
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,040
which experiments are now optimally

1627
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,839
informative

1628
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,440
even if those experiments the data

1629
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,880
already exist maybe it's just an

1630
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,599
analysis

1631
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,640
but that's still an experiment another

1632
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,480
question is what's the next step for

1633
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,680
active inference

1634
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,559
maybe we could bring active inference

1635
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,119
models

1636
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,520
to bear um using some of these new

1637
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,200
tutorials that are becoming available

1638
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,599
on large psychological databases and see

1639
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,040
if there's an active inference or a

1640
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
cybernetic descriptor of behavior

1641
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,480
that explains more variance more

1642
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,079
parsimoniously than the big five

1643
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,599
structure does another question is what

1644
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,640
is the goals

1645
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,119
of this research what do different

1646
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,400
people want to see

1647
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,040
happen and what are the goals of the

1648
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,240
research

1649
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,720
and also very importantly what are we

1650
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,480
still curious about

1651
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,640
because there's going to be 13.1 and

1652
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,079
13.2

1653
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,680
where we as a group discuss this paper

1654
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,200
and then we'll have more papers to come

1655
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,960
so it's okay to be curious about it

1656
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
any level anytime you're listening to

1657
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,079
this

1658
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,240
live or in replay but yeah just uh

1659
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
leave a comment on the video or join us

1660
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,160
in the discussion if you listen to this

1661
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,599
at the right time

1662
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,440
and it's good to hear about what you're

1663
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,119
curious about because in this video i

1664
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,800
really just tried to

1665
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,920
run through the figures and give some

1666
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,400
background or some definitions so maybe

1667
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,440
some parts were

1668
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,359
a bit too much or too little for some

1669
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,280
people so as always it's just throwing

1670
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,240
it out there

1671
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,680
and let me know uh how can improve

1672
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,079
so thanks for participating even

1673
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,079
listening is participating

1674
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,079
we provide follow-up forms to live

1675
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,520
participants

1676
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,079
and we request your feedback suggestions

1677
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
or questions

1678
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,319
and just uh stay in communication and

1679
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:42,880
hopefully

1680
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,160
we will see you another time so thanks

1681
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
for listening and i'm gonna stop the

1682
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,839
live stream
