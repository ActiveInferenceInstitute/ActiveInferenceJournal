to participate welcome to the active

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
inference lab

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
we are an experiment in online team

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
communication learning

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
and practice related to active inference

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,479
you can find us at our website

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,399
twitter gmail youtube or our keybase

public team and public username and this

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,840
is a recorded in an archived live stream

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
so please provide us with feedback so

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079

welcome here and as far as video

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
etiquette for live stream goes

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
mute if there's noise in the background

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,399

can just raise their hand if they want

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,800
to say something that's

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
related or unrelated uh the same

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
questions from last week will put up and

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
take a little bit of a different go

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
at them so what is something you are

126
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
excited about today

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,199
and what is something that you liked or

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,360
remembered about the paper

129
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
uh anyone can go for it i'd be curious

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
to either of the authors just

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
looking back on it it's not so long ago

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,639
but we are in a new

133
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
year so with the fresh lens of

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,919
the numerology of the year and just

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
maybe these discussions

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
how are you looking back at what you had

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,479
done

138
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
and seeing it in a new or a different

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
way

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,919
or any other participants who want to

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,360
add something that they

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
thought of go ahead

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
oh i i might as well go ahead then i was

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
just going to say that i don't know that

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,680
for me maybe even more so than for adam

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
this particular chapter was sort of

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,080
right at the boundary of the things that

148
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
i've been thinking about and

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,759
working with adam has really pushed me

150
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,360
into um

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
you know making contact with this whole

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
topic of active inference and the kind

153
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,160
of

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
you know fristonian world um and then

155
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
it's also made me

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
think more about about

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
modeling um because i've generally been

158
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,160
fairly skeptical

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,199
about the value of trying to model whole

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
agents that are analogous to actual

161
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,479
human beings

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,720
uh for learning things about psychology

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
just because uh

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
because the brain and people are so

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
complex you know if you

166
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,759
if you have a model it has to have a

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
sufficient degree of verisimilitude

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
in resembling the thing that you're

169
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,039
modeling before you're likely to

170
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
actually learn new things just

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
from studying the model rather than

172
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,199
learning about you know the limitations

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
of the model in one way or another and

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
your skillet modeling

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
but i guess one of the things that

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
writing this chapter with adam

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
made me think about was mars different

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
levels of analysis

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
and the way that if you get a good

180
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
enough uh resemblance

181
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
at the level of uh of function or

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,919
computation

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
you might be able to learn things even

184
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
if uh

185
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
you don't have varisimilitude at the

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
level of

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
implementation uh or or algorithm right

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,960
we don't necessarily have to say that

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
the brain is doing the exact kind of

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
mathematical computations that

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
that you know fep demands and in the

192
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,039
same way that we would do them

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
to model it but as long as we're

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
capturing something that

195
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
truly resembles the functional

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
computation

197
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
that a cybernetic system like a human

198
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
being needs to carry out

199
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
we might actually be able to learn

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
new things about the way that people

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
work

202
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
cool steven and then anyone else who

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
wants to raise their hand but just maybe

204
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
we could hear from everybody

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
in the warm-up so steven and then adam

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
and then anyone else

207
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
i'm really excited by the fact that this

208
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,919
is a you know

209
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,080
taps into a very widely used

210
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
tool in psychology so and then links

211
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
this back

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
to these new potentials of active

213
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,160
inference

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
which you know we've talked a lot about

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,960
maybe in more theoretical philosophy

216
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,720
philosophical ways but this really is

217
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
showing um how it you know the twos can

218
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
start to

219
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
move into each other so i'm curious

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
today to see more ways in which

221
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
you know there's questions about um

222
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
you know the potential for that going

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
forward you know what

224
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
what possibilities in the field of even

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
organizational psychology which

226
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
uses these traits as well it's this

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
these these traits are

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
kind of used beyond kind of

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
work with um sort of therapeutic

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
environment so um and you know even with

231
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
the myers-briggs and other types of

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
things how can

233
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,959
a more dynamic or kind of embodied you

234
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,480
know what's the future basically

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
for applied psychology who

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
adam then scott

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,160
um so this

238
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
actually working with colin on this um

239
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
it really stretched me

240
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
also was that the like limits of what i

241
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
was used to thinking about

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
and uh i think i never

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
like really seriously engaged with

244
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
personality science before this like i

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,000
was always

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
interested but then i think i was also

247
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,839
like skeptical that

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,320
they had any uh chance of carving nature

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
at his joints

250
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
and i was just like uh maybe and

251
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,920
but then as we started exploring the

252
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
correspondences between like the

253
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
cybernetic view of personality

254
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
and the other cybernetic perspective of

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
active inference i started to become

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
more compelled

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
and then i'd say like things are always

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,000
kind of moving around for me in terms

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
of like uh

260
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
perspectives but um i think recently

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
some of the things i've been thinking

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,200
about is

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
like how far can we

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
stretch or apply this these ideas of

265
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,920
personality

266
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
over uh what scales and what ranges of

267
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,519
systems uh

268
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,480
can we think of the personalities of

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
societies the personalities of

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
uh any system uh and so

271
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
that's i think most recently been uh on

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
my mind

273
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
but i'm excited to be here because uh uh

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
i love these live streams and uh last

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
week was awesome

276
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,399
cool agreed scott and then sasha than

277
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
anyone else

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
so a couple of things the the the active

279
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
inference is totally new to me

280
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
and it's really been revelatory as other

281
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,959
people have said

282
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
a couple of things i used to work in

283
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
identity a lot still do

284
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
identity kind of systems federated

285
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,920
identity kind of technical stuff

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
not on the technical side what i

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
realized is the attributes are carried

288
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,399
in these

289
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
markov blankets right so the you know

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
the the access to attributes is through

291
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
this

292
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
the statistical views of the surface of

293
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,320
other systems

294
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
and so that's been really useful to me

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
and then the other part i realized is

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
i realize that a lot of folks um fristen

297
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
and others are coming at this from the

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
biology perspective of seeing

299
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
gee how do these things emerge by

300
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,200
themselves what i realize is as a lawyer

301
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
all i've ever done is construct

302
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
synthetic markov blankets

303
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,240
because contracts are revealing a

304
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
surface of a system in fact

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
the system doesn't exist until the

306
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
contract exists forget

307
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
corporations if i want to put a supply

308
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
chain in place i write a contract and

309
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,279
then

310
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,320
the organism of the supply chain exists

311
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,279
as a result and so it's funny because in

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,240
that idea of

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
if it's too rarified for viewing human

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,480
mind i get it

315
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
and it's interesting because in the

316
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
de-risking context where a lot of folks

317
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,959
are getting together

318
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
they try to make it simpler you know

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
worry about bankruptcy worry about

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
notice worry about these specific things

321
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
boom boom

322
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,279
that's all they care about so it's kind

323
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,040
of like a synthetic

324
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
organism constructed by the contract the

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
markov blanket defines the organism it's

326
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
like the opposite of the

327
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
blind men and the elephant where they're

328
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
trying to find the elephant here there

329
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
is no elephant until there are other

330
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,519
parameters

331
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,040
so the the attributes define the system

332
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
and it's a very bounded system very few

333
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
attributes to it but it simplifies it

334
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
and that's what a lot of regulatory

335
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
market issues are about so that's been

336
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,720
huge for me

337
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
really realizing that we can

338
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
synthetically construct these systems

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
and base them on shared story shared

340
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,800
narrative

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
shared meaning contracts as a formal way

342
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
of doing that but folkways is an

343
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
informal way of doing that and i think

344
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
that's absolutely a very rich

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,079
avenue for for my work and i'm

346
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,839
looking forward to working with others

347
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
on it thanks cool

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
thank you sasha and then anyone else on

349
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,560
the warm-up

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
yeah sasha then adam okay um

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
yeah uh i'm just really kind of

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,959
following up on what adam

353
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
mentioned um thinking about other

354
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
applications for

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
um the big five theory and what other

356
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
groups and organisms they might apply to

357
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,519
and i think uh

358
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,279
very relevantly for this group and

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
of the kind of projects that we're

360
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
working on is um

361
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
personalities of a team um and uh

362
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
thinking about different behaviors i'm

363
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,760
i'm sure this isn't a novel concept um

364
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
but i'd love to hear more about it from

365
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,399
the authors

366
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
of other possible applications

367
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,800
um of these metrics for uh teams

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,160
of varying sizes um and the other

369
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,680
thing i've been thinking about since

370
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
last week is this

371
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,079
um if this paper aims to integrate

372
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,720
these two concepts of active inference

373
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,120
and

374
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,680
um the big five theory um

375
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,000
are there parts that are incongruent is

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
there something that doesn't

377
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
um that can't work together from both of

378
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,120
these systems

379
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
and is there something that active

380
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,399
inference

381
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,839
can glean or kind of take away

382
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,519
from personality research in a way that

383
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,480
you know hasn't really been tried before

384
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
cool questions thanks adam then blue

385
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,040
uh somewhat flipping uh what i said

386
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
before related to

387
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
uh what sasha and scott just said um so

388
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,320
like in

389
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
also not just applying personality to

390
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
other systems where you might not

391
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
normally think of them in terms of

392
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
personality

393
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
um i'm also interested in like reversing

394
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,399
that flow

395
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
so it's like we how might we think of

396
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
the personality of teams but

397
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
the things we know about teams how might

398
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
that influence how we think about

399
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
persons and their personalities or uh

400
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
contracts like what are analogies or

401
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
models that could be derived

402
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,120
by thinking of what you described or

403
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
this like inactive

404
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
contract like creating the mark of like

405
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,160
the contract

406
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,240
in the in the doing

407
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
um to what extent can we

408
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
have this as part of um person formation

409
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,079
and personal evolution personality

410
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,399
evolution um i don't know if that makes

411
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,440
sense but

412
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
that's another place i've been thinking

413
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
is like this bi-directional flow of like

414
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
taking things from persons putting them

415
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,079
in terms of things we might not normally

416
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,519
think of as persons

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,800
taking things we might not normally

418
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,639
think of as persons and then

419
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,839
putting it back to persons and their

420
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
personalities yeah it's kind of like

421
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
finding the human in the non-human

422
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
atom really interesting point so

423
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
personifying and

424
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
enlivening things that are perceived as

425
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
inanimate and then finding the mechanism

426
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
inside of living systems2 so blue then

427
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,320
colin so going back

428
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
to what adam was saying not just now but

429
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
earlier um and

430
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,440
also just something that i liked about

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
the paper so for me psychology has kind

432
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,800
of always been like

433
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
this soft science like you can't really

434
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
do science on psychology but really like

435
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
what what that means is that it's a

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
wicked problem right

437
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
it just falls into the complexity realm

438
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
like people are

439
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
super super intricate complicated it's a

440
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,519
convoluted like thing

441
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
so this paper for me really um was

442
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
awesome in the way that it kind of

443
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,519
concretized

444
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,079
or hardened up for for me like a

445
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,519
quantitative way to

446
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
um really look at personality

447
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,279
interesting colin than anyone else and

448
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,240
i'll put up the third question as well

449
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
well first i'm really glad to hear that

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
this might have convinced somebody that

451
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
psychology wasn't just

452
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,480
soft science uh it's it's definitely

453
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,279
hard

454
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,839
science in the sense that it's difficult

455
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,360
um

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
and that's largely about you know issues

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
well it's two things i think it's issues

458
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
with measurement

459
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,360
um the the kinds of measurements that we

460
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,240
want to do and can do

461
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
you know they don't necessarily line up

462
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,359
very well in terms of precision and so

463
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
you know everyone has physics envy

464
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
because you've got precision down to

465
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
10 decimal places on measurements but

466
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
you know we're lucky if we have

467
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,520
precision down to uh down to one decimal

468
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
place or if it's even clear that our

469
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
measurements are

470
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
you know anything other than essentially

471
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,319
heuristic you know if you have a

472
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,960
if you have a scale and you're measuring

473
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,559
a personality trait

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,240
and essentially what you've got is just

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
a measure of people's

476
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
uh you know degree of a particular kind

477
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
of behavior or experience

478
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
relative to other people so the

479
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
measurement is relative and it's not

480
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
clear that the

481
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
you know one point on the scale actually

482
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
corresponds to

483
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
uh some true interval

484
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,679
rather than just a kind of heuristic

485
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,679
approximation so yeah there are a lot of

486
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
really difficult challenges in

487
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
psychology

488
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
but nonetheless i mean in order to do

489
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,480
science you just have to have some kind

490
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,760
of standardized measurement

491
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
and then be able to uh to replicate

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
right to see if other people can get it

493
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
i used to think that you had to have uh

494
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
you know hypothesis testing too but then

495
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
i realized you can really just do

496
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,520
science

497
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,960
if you do it exploratory work and then

498
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
replicate it

499
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
because once you've found something that

500
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
then de facto becomes the hypothesis for

501
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
the replication attempt

502
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
so all you're really looking for are

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,200
reliable patterns

504
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
in reality fundamentally and i think we

505
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
can do that to some extent

506
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,559
in psychology i wanted to say something

507
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
also about uh

508
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,440
sasha's question about the

509
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
you know whether there are

510
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,440
incompatibilities between

511
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,559
um fep and active inference and

512
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
um general approaches to

513
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
personality and my theoretical approach

514
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
specifically

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,799
um and i think one of the things that's

516
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,640
really nice about active inference is

517
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,120
that

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,799
it's uh it's it's very low level in some

519
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
sense it's this formalism

520
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,120
that is extremely widely applicable um

521
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,400
and the way that i see it is that it's

522
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
essentially a formalism

523
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
that captures the essence of all

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
cybernetic systems

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
um and so you know i haven't found

526
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,280
anything

527
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
that makes me say oh this isn't gonna

528
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
work you know it's like

529
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,679
there's a lot of detail about what

530
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,480
people are

531
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
that isn't captured in active inference

532
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
but only because it's so

533
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,799
low level but like there's nothing about

534
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
active inference that isn't crucial to

535
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
what people are right because

536
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
you know that the process of uh

537
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
you know pursuing goals via feedback

538
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
that is just necessarily the core of

539
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
what an agent is

540
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
and so i guess my concern isn't that

541
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
they're incompatibilities

542
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
it is how to draw out the ai framework

543
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,480
in such a way that it makes contact with

544
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,600
a lot of the

545
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
specifics that we know about humans

546
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
function rather than the generalities

547
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
about how all cybernetic systems

548
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
function

549
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
really interesting answer we'll go to

550
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:04,559
dave

551
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
and then markup hi my professor

552
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,320
of cybernetics gordon pasque in the

553
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,880
1950s and 60s

554
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
developed some very fine-grained

555
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,400
measures

556
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
of learning strategies

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
which is how individuals approach a

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
specific concrete task as they're

559
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
learning it

560
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
and learning styles which is a more

561
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
systematic

562
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
way that folks uh develop

563
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,559
a fixed repertoire of approaches to a

564
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,280
task that

565
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
the extremes of the on that scale are

566
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
serial learning and holistic

567
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
learning i believe the

568
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
the areas of his data where he uses

569
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,000
uh entropy as an important measure for

570
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
certainty and for tolerance for

571
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,159
ambiguity

572
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,120
should tie in with um

573
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,440
the um active what

574
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,200
the not not the active insurance the

575
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
other the other major area

576
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
that we're talking about uh free energy

577
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
and i suspect that the

578
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,480
learning styles should correlate with

579
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
personality and that is an area that i

580
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,760
believe he

581
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,480
uh past did work on so that's something

582
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
i need to dig into the literature on and

583
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,679
compare it cool marco

584
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
hi thanks um also thank you scott that

585
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,159
was very well put

586
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,440
um so

587
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
in general i just really like a lot of

588
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
things that have been said um

589
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
about active influence as a as a

590
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
framework i

591
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,360
i also echo the notion that the beauty

592
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,240
is that it's so

593
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
uh generally applicable that you can

594
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
kind of elaborate it and

595
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,640
that becomes a kind of game of if you

596
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,919
take a bit further with a few

597
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,720
assumptions

598
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
uh when does it touch or overlap or

599
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
align with other existing years or

600
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
empirical data

601
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
but what has been mentioned and

602
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
something i find personally an

603
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,760
intriguing possibility

604
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
is um not necessarily active inference

605
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,080
but if something like active influence

606
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
would be true

607
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
and it would indeed be the most

608
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
approximate description

609
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,400
of our neural dynamics then

610
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,919
naturally follow that it also can become

611
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
quite intuitive so just like colin said

612
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,120
that you can elaborate

613
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
until it kind of touches something else

614
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
in terms of theory you could also maybe

615
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
consider the idea that you can elaborate

616
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,840
your understanding of active influence

617
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,600
relative to personality or other

618
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,880
psychological notions

619
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,360
until start to touch your kind of social

620
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,799
psychological notions

621
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,000
of people of yourself of others society

622
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,080
and i think that's what i think someone

623
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
in the beginning said i think i think

624
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
was stephen about the future of applied

625
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,120
psychology and i think this is really

626
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,080
really crucial

627
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
not just from a scientific perspective

628
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
but also a social and

629
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
humanist perspective because

630
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
i mean i think most people agree that

631
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
folk psychology isn't enough and i think

632
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
also most people agree that most

633
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
scientific psychology

634
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
whether it's a neuro or clinical side

635
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
isn't very easily implementable

636
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
uh in terms of actual understanding

637
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,480
yourself by first person

638
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,840
so i think that's definitely the most

639
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,960
exciting aspect i think this

640
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
particular work is a very nice milestone

641
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,559
with regards to that

642
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
i mean i don't think anyone really

643
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
understands itself that much better with

644
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
uh some ratings on the big five but

645
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
knowing the mechanisms i think is a very

646
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
very beautiful lens to understand myself

647
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,360
so

648
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,760
cheers thank you for sharing steven and

649
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
then anyone else

650
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
yeah so following on from what marco was

651
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
saying though is

652
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
like the the fact that this paper also

653
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
takes in the affordances

654
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
and and active influence like you say

655
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
does this dynamics you

656
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
you gives this generative potential to

657
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,200
the

658
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,640
big five which i know is kind of

659
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
sort of seen to be there but you know

660
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
the the challenges that they can end up

661
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
being

662
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
whether you like it or not prescriptive

663
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
and kind of diagnostic

664
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,960
to some extent and having a way to

665
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
relate them

666
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
opens up that phenomenological sense

667
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,679
because there's a i think what i'm

668
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,120
really interested is

669
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
if people structure their metaphorical

670
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
models of how they

671
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,120
cognized in the world like how they

672
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,679
whether they relate to time as time

673
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,279
coming towards them or they're going

674
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
towards time or whether

675
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
they're um trying to um

676
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,919
build a a more firm career

677
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,400
or they're trying to get on in the world

678
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,600
and travel and go

679
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,919
somewhere so those kind of

680
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
phenomenological ways of structuring

681
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,679
thought

682
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
they they seems to be more ways that you

683
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,679
can then connect them

684
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
as opposed to it being like completely

685
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,520
disconnected

686
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,320
or just too big a gap to bridge so this

687
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,520
uh

688
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,360
this mixture of the affordances the

689
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
dynamics the blanket and the attention

690
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
and the way that phenomenological

691
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,120
um sort of structuring could happen even

692
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
at the individual level

693
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
starts to become more plausible which is

694
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
kind of cool

695
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,440
awesome yeah a lot of cool ideas coming

696
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,919
up

697
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
one theme to return to is that

698
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
by looking at the patterns and thinking

699
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,120
about the frameworks that span

700
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,799
different systems of different levels of

701
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
analysis we can think about

702
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,919
like the traits of organizations

703
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
teams individuals organs cells so that's

704
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,400
the multi-scale

705
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
kind of complex systems approach because

706
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
we set out

707
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,080
to look for patterns across systems and

708
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
then that led to all these interesting

709
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
questions like would there be a big five

710
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
for teams or how are the generative

711
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
models of individual personality

712
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
related to the generative models or the

713
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
generative processes underlying

714
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,960
group personalities and so pretty

715
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,039
interesting things that we're coming to

716
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,000
any other points

717
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
in this intro before we just return to

718
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,840
some of the later pages

719
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,559
colin go ahead and then anyone else i'll

720
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,080
just make one point in relation

721
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
to this issue of uh you know team

722
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
dynamics and personalities at other

723
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
scales

724
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,919
um that's something that

725
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,200
there are different ways to approach it

726
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
right so people have certainly

727
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,559
psychologists have certainly studied

728
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,880
uh what happens to teams that have

729
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,600
different

730
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
characteristics of the individual

731
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
members

732
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,080
uh and so you could think of how do the

733
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
personalities of individual members of a

734
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,240
team

735
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
influence the success of the team

736
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,080
um so for example people having people

737
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
high in openness on the team

738
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,039
tends to uh make it more effective in

739
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,799
various ways and it seems to be because

740
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,679
of

741
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
that's especially true for leaderless

742
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
teams right so if you have a it's not

743
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
necessarily true if there's a clearly

744
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,480
established kind of leadership structure

745
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,679
in the team but if you have leaderless

746
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
teams then having people who are more

747
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
sort of cognitively

748
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,279
flexible enables them to kind of

749
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,360
organize themselves better so

750
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
but i think that what we're thinking

751
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,320
about here is something a little bit

752
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,679
different like is there a personality of

753
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
a team as a whole that might be more

754
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
than the sum of its parts

755
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
um and you know they're

756
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,840
you're probably they're probably going

757
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,000
to be well you you need to do a sort of

758
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,600
parallel kind of research in

759
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
terms of trying to come up with a

760
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,960
comprehensive

761
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,760
just set of descriptors of the

762
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,279
properties of teams

763
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,720
and then seeing if they varied

764
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,919
systematically in the same way that

765
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,919
people did with individuals and

766
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,080
leading to the big five but i guess one

767
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,039
of my intuitions

768
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,120
is that the highest level of the

769
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,799
personality hierarchy

770
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,880
stability and plasticity which are also

771
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,760
the most replicable across different

772
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
languages when people have done the kind

773
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,320
of big five research

774
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
so there's this very clear way in which

775
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
uh what i think

776
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
of as the two fundamental properties of

777
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,039
all cybernetic systems you know

778
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
at least ones that have to be able to

779
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
function in an unpredictable and complex

780
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,360
environment

781
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,120
that is probably applicable at virtually

782
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
any scale even for something that might

783
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,240
not be well

784
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,520
it's i think it's an interesting

785
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,080
question whether something like a team

786
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,520
or a society

787
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
is actually a cybernetic system itself

788
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,919
or whether it is an emergent dynamic out

789
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,559
of a set

790
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
of cybernetic systems interacting with

791
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,159
each other

792
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
but regardless i think you can certainly

793
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
describe the stability and plasticity of

794
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
teams or even societies right you can

795
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,600
describe

796
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,520
them in terms of how much they focus on

797
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
and value

798
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
the lack of disruption of their

799
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
functioning versus how much they value

800
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,080
expansion and exploration and dynamic

801
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
growth

802
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
cool that reminds me so much of the ant

803
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,360
research and

804
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
do colonies have phenotypes or is it

805
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,880
just the phenotypes of nest mates

806
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,200
to selection shape colony traits or is

807
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,399
it just shaping the nest mates and

808
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,520
they're duking it out

809
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
so all these multi-level systems we kind

810
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
of can see these similarities

811
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
so adam and then scott and then anyone

812
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
else

813
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
so in relation what collin just said

814
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,840
um correct me if i'm wrong but i believe

815
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,159
in terms of like cross-cultural

816
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,679
like the robustness um like

817
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
is it the stability and plasticity like

818
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
this like that level of granularity

819
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,559
actually is what is

820
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
the most broadly applicable in terms of

821
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,159
like showing the least

822
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,000
variation like if you look at it in

823
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,799
those two yes so in terms of the lexical

824
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,120
research like starting from a specific

825
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,320
uh language and extracting descriptors

826
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
and then doing the same kind of

827
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,520
you know ratings and factor analytic

828
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,919
work the only truly universal

829
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,520
solution that's been found is the

830
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,279
two-factor solution and those factors

831
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,720
very closely resemble

832
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,760
stability and plasticity okay so yeah so

833
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,960
that would support the idea like if

834
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,120
we're trying to do like a multi-scale

835
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,960
personality story or a

836
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,080
quasi-anthropomorphizing of

837
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
of uh of quasi agents or maybe we should

838
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
just call them agents

839
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,919
depending on our view that yes we will

840
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,600
be most likely to find stability in

841
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,120
plasticity

842
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,000
but um you know because like you

843
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
basically grounded the big five

844
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,200
as part of cybernetic functioning and if

845
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,559
any uh cis like from an active inference

846
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
perspective if any like

847
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,760
sustaining uh system is doing some kind

848
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,480
of

849
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
either explicit or implicit goal pursuit

850
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,559
we actually

851
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
might find like even the big five itself

852
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
like being surprisingly applicable

853
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
although like as you're saying like it's

854
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,240
an empirical question

855
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,320
and so like so i guess the idea is we

856
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,919
actually do the research program of this

857
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:42,480
sort of

858
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,919
derivation of factors and and with and

859
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,520
then we should expect to find things

860
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:47,840
that

861
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,720
might be uh shockingly like the big five

862
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,080
and places where you might not expect

863
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
them

864
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,519
nice i didn't raise my hand but i just

865
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,279
wanted to come in and say like i think

866
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,200
the best analogy for that that's going

867
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
on in science right now is

868
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
uh over the last let's say 20 years

869
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
people have really started to take

870
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,559
seriously the idea of personality and

871
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,840
other species

872
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,000
now i mean whether personality is the

873
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
right word there or we want some other

874
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
one it doesn't really matter right you

875
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,159
have individual differences in

876
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,679
psychological functioning of other

877
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,799
species

878
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,159
and so people have been doing this

879
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,840
attempting to come up with

880
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
you know extensive sets of descriptors

881
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,200
of other species

882
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,679
and uh you know ratings of them or

883
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,200
coding based on

884
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,799
you know video or observation or

885
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,399
whatever and then looking to see whether

886
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,000
there are these similar patterns

887
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
and most of the big five are

888
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
identifiable uh

889
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,279
or you know fairly close analogs in

890
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,559
other species

891
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,279
and um the one that is the least

892
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,360
commonly found is actually maybe sort of

893
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
uh

894
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,399
you know proof of concept in a way

895
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
because conscientiousness is the

896
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,880
dimension that

897
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,240
least appears in other species

898
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
something like conscientiousness and and

899
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
in fact the only two species where

900
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,760
something close to that has appeared as

901
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
its own separate dimension is in bonobos

902
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
and chimpanzees right and so

903
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,120
you think like what really makes humans

904
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,039
special well it's our ability to

905
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,039
plan for the distant future and to

906
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,880
prioritize goals that aren't

907
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,279
uh me immediate or near immediate and to

908
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,000
really

909
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,080
have these elaborate goal hierarchies

910
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
and so it might not be surprising that

911
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,200
it's only our nearest evolutionary

912
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
neighbors

913
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
that have these kind identifiable

914
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
patterns that are

915
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,159
uh that are related to those abilities

916
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:26,960
and that are

917
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
separate from things just like you know

918
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,080
how emotionally reactive you are

919
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
very interesting scott and then i think

920
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,559
adam and then marco

921
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,120
so that this is great this um one of the

922
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
things i thought was interesting is like

923
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,799
you know

924
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,279
what gets measured gets done and what

925
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,039
gets measured gets seen

926
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,240
and so it's kind of interesting because

927
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
we're coming it's like a bio theory of

928
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
everything

929
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,799
kind of idea here and we're like wow

930
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,480
this is really explanatory

931
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,919
my recollection is that quantum

932
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,159
mechanics was just a calculation

933
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:56,960
convention

934
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
originally but it kind of works and we

935
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
kind of use it and even though we don't

936
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,679
understand all of it

937
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,080
it's kind of helpful that way so it's

938
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
not so much is it true but is it useful

939
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
and it's this is broadly useful and so

940
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
it's interesting in living systems or

941
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,760
cybernetic systems

942
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,320
we start to get at these questions we

943
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,159
ask and when we ask questions from the

944
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,919
i don't know i'd like someone to tell me

945
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
what the big five is after i make this

946
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,159
comment but

947
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,000
the um the if they're the big five of

948
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
consciousness then

949
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,000
the um i always think of them as the

950
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
accounting firms but that's just because

951
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,640
i was a lawyer for so many years

952
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,080
but um but the uh what are

953
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
we it's like we're using the turing test

954
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
in a way it's too much hubris about

955
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,080
our form of intelligence right and so if

956
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
we point our

957
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,200
measurement instrument at a certain

958
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,799
thing that's we're going to see if we

959
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,320
point our measurement instrument at

960
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,039
human

961
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,120
cognition human consciousness our sense

962
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,240
of human consciousness

963
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,000
that's what we're going to see and so

964
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
this is a great discussion there's no

965
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,200
it's not a to me it's not a

966
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
truth-finding thing but a

967
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
a usefulness of the paradigm kind of

968
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,559
issue and if someone could tell me what

969
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,840
the big five are just list them that

970
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,039
would be good because i'm not familiar

971
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,080
with the term

972
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,279
as in parlance sure it's the big five

973
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,599
dimensions that are empirically observed

974
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,599
when you ask people personality trait

975
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,399
surveys

976
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,879
and their openness conscientiousness

977
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,679
extroversion

978
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,800
agreeableness neuroticism ocean and then

979
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,359
um

980
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,760
one metaphor on the big five and uh it's

981
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,480
kind of like

982
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,560
the big five continents that's what we

983
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
have in the world

984
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
as we have it and so that is specifics

985
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,760
that's related to history and that

986
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,480
changes

987
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
but the the principle is water and land

988
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
and so maybe in a different system a

989
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,119
different sphere with a different type

990
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,918
of water level

991
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,918
you still would have water and land but

992
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,119
the actual number

993
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,079
of big dimensions might be empirically

994
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,199
seen to be different

995
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
so that's kind of an interesting thing

996
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,480
um i think adam

997
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,079
then marco then colin

998
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,599
uh i don't know if this would be useful

999
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
but perhaps in a bit actually might be

1000
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,400
good to

1001
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,359
have colin talk about like the specific

1002
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,200
mappings of the big five

1003
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
onto uh cybernetic function that he

1004
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,079
describes in his original paper

1005
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
uh that could be useful for people but

1006
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
um

1007
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,079
it's

1008
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,839
interesting about um so conscientiously

1009
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
being less likely to

1010
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
generalize potentially across species or

1011
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,480
systems

1012
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,440
because uh it seems like that makes some

1013
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
sense to me and that

1014
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,160
um in terms of preserving uh goal

1015
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
hierarchy integrity

1016
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
as you're confronted with all these

1017
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,880
different like circumstances but you

1018
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,280
want to maintain this overall ex like

1019
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,160
broadly applicable gold hierarchy that's

1020
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
benefiting you overall

1021
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
um in order for that to be the case you

1022
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
have to have

1023
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,320
a system capable of generative modeling

1024
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,079
with or modeling with a certain

1025
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,119
degree of temporal depth and the

1026
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,240
policies it's pursuing and

1027
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,480
counterfactual richness such that it

1028
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
could actually get itself into trouble

1029
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,240
and get confused and go down like wrong

1030
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,000
paths and so you wouldn't expect this

1031
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
for all systems you would expect this

1032
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,880
you need a certain degree of

1033
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
sophistication even maybe sophisticated

1034
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,320
effective inference in order for you to

1035
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,920
really actually need something like

1036
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,839
conscientiousness so that one actually

1037
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,040
might not generalize as much um

1038
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,079
the and related to

1039
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,280
what scott just said um there seems to

1040
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,000
be this

1041
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
yeah interesting combination it's like

1042
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,040
um

1043
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
realist versus instrumentalists or it's

1044
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,000
like you can think of like this

1045
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,839
personality is almost like

1046
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,280
uh like the big five is like an

1047
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,359
effective field theory over

1048
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,400
persons um where it's

1049
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
um a good approximate description um

1050
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,680
a a useful course screening but now the

1051
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,440
question i would have though is but is

1052
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,079
it like just

1053
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,400
completely so there's a sense in which

1054
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
it's modeler relative

1055
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
it's based on our interests but there's

1056
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
like another sentiment which it's like

1057
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
well

1058
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,760
um like what worked in evolution and

1059
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
like it's like you don't have to take

1060
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,200
the perspective of evolution

1061
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
but it's a we can all kind of converge

1062
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
on it's like quasi objective like

1063
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
it's one of many perspectives but it's a

1064
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,720
pretty darn good perspective

1065
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
or an important one to keep in mind and

1066
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,079
so in that sense the big five actually

1067
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,720
might be

1068
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,480
carving nature at its joints in a really

1069
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,720
powerful way and so i guess one

1070
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,640
more thing along those lines is um uh

1071
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
can be good for probably column to talk

1072
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,480
about this since you discovered them

1073
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,599
uh which is the aspects um and so one

1074
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,560
thing i'm wondering is

1075
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,320
uh so it seems like in a lot of

1076
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,800
studies when you do things at the level

1077
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,359
so

1078
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,920
as a correct me if i'm wrong but it's

1079
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,400
kind of

1080
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,720
um so under so the big five has this

1081
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
hierarchical structure

1082
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,480
over them you'll have these two

1083
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
metatrades which we've been discussing

1084
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,240
of stability as shared variants of

1085
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
conscientiousness agreeableness and

1086
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
inverse neuroticism

1087
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,800
and plasticity a shared variance of

1088
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,119
extroversion and openness

1089
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,079
but then underneath the big five um

1090
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,640
column

1091
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
that you'll get if you like force if

1092
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
you'd like to have the water level uh

1093
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
go there's a down or up

1094
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,599
i'm i'm messing up daniel's like analogy

1095
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,119
but you'll get

1096
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,960
um two and only two

1097
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,760
aspects underneath each of them and

1098
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
what's interesting is they

1099
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,440
oftentimes kind of read as being across

1100
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
purposes with each other

1101
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
it's like these are very different not

1102
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,839
across they're very different it's very

1103
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,040
different to be like

1104
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
industrious versus orderly like these

1105
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,599
are very different ways of being in the

1106
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,800
world or if like you're neurotic

1107
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,880
it's like very different to being like

1108
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
um withdrawing or being like more

1109
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
volatile and like reactive

1110
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,320
like um and so i guess one thing i'm

1111
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
wondering is like

1112
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,960
both in doing um active inferential

1113
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,599
modeling of

1114
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,599
persons and trying to suss out

1115
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,800
personality

1116
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,960
would it be better to actually in some

1117
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
ways focus on the aspects

1118
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
in terms of finding joints there but

1119
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,200
also maybe across

1120
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
other cybernetic systems like could

1121
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,320
there be more purpose

1122
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,680
uh purchase from the aspects who and i

1123
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,280
just flipped to the slide so just

1124
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,200
for anyone can just say go to this

1125
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,040
figure or go to this other thing so

1126
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,240
colin and then marco

1127
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
sorry you're muted

1128
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,160
thank you for the reminder um yeah so

1129
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
while there's a lot to

1130
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
uh think about in what's been said in

1131
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,560
the last

1132
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
couple of comments now um

1133
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
so in terms of this idea of uh

1134
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,720
of continence and water and land i do

1135
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
think that there's a way in which

1136
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
uh you know stability and plasticity are

1137
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,359
like the equivalent of

1138
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,000
of water and land so that pretty much uh

1139
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,599
any organism

1140
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,280
you're going to be able to identify you

1141
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
know if there's any kind of individual

1142
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,000
variability which of course there must

1143
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,079
be in order for evolution to proceed

1144
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,040
like so probably um you know if you take

1145
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,720
amoebas for example they're not going to

1146
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
have a lot of different personality

1147
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,119
dimensions

1148
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,960
but nonetheless you might find some that

1149
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
are a bit more

1150
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
of the same species that are a bit more

1151
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,560
exploratory and others that are a bit

1152
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,440
more

1153
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,800
uh more cautious let's say so

1154
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
you know even at this very simple level

1155
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,359
you may get this trade-off between

1156
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,079
uh do you do things that keep your

1157
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:24,880
functioning

1158
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,599
running uh without disruption or do you

1159
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,800
do things that lead to

1160
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,240
greater uh expanse and uh

1161
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
discovery of new resources so those

1162
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,920
probably do trade off

1163
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,280
i would hope that when we're within a

1164
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
species though that the the big five are

1165
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,480
not

1166
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,960
um like just the continents in other

1167
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
words they're not just a historical

1168
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,520
accident i think that they actually

1169
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,960
reflect

1170
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,200
variation in parameters that have

1171
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
evolved and that are present

1172
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,000
in uh in every you know intact

1173
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,520
organism of that species

1174
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,119
the issue though in terms of carving

1175
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,760
nature at its joints is just that the

1176
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,240
nature in this case is so complicated

1177
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,119
right so

1178
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,520
uh if you look at this is a good figure

1179
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,160
actually that

1180
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,000
uh daniel put up to make this point

1181
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,680
which is that

1182
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,800
um when we draw these kinds of

1183
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,280
hierarchical taxonomies of personality

1184
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
traits

1185
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,280
uh they are necessarily over

1186
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,599
simplifications

1187
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,680
especially at the levels below the big

1188
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,520
five because we know

1189
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,079
that personality does not have simple

1190
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,040
structure

1191
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,720
and what that means from a factor

1192
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
analytic perspective is that

1193
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,240
if you took the taxonomy uh exactly

1194
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
literally that's depicted there

1195
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
you would say well for example uh no

1196
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,319
trait that is underneath

1197
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,000
extraversion that's a subcomponent of

1198
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,400
extroversion can be related to any trait

1199
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,480
that is a subcomponent of

1200
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,839
agreeableness right because there are no

1201
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,040
lines connecting them in that figure

1202
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,680
but in fact the pattern of association

1203
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,760
and covariation among more specific

1204
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
personality traits below the big five

1205
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,520
is considerably more complicated than

1206
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
that would suggest

1207
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,000
and so for example assertiveness is

1208
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,319
negatively correlated with politeness

1209
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,680
right so assertiveness is part of

1210
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,440
extraversion politeness is part of

1211
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,960
agreeableness

1212
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,480
those are correlated with each other

1213
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,240
however it happens that the

1214
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,319
enthusiastic or sociable component of

1215
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,319
extraversion is positively correlated

1216
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,319
with the other aspect of agreeableness

1217
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,920
which is compassion and caring about

1218
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,800
other people

1219
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
and so you have two different components

1220
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,560
of extroversion correlating in opposite

1221
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
directions with two different components

1222
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,599
of agreeableness

1223
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,520
and those end up canceling each other

1224
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,880
out and so at the

1225
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,599
first at the other level you see no

1226
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,440
correlation between agreeableness and

1227
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,640
extroversion

1228
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
uh essentially so this whole thing you

1229
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,200
know the structure it looks simple in

1230
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,319
the picture but

1231
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,880
uh you know it's a lot more complicated

1232
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,440
uh the

1233
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
the lower down you go and so i would

1234
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,640
have

1235
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,000
you know i it seems to me that these

1236
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
aspect level distinctions are important

1237
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
uh they have they're they are supported

1238
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,200
by some

1239
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,119
behavioral genetic research as well as

1240
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,640
some of my own research just at the

1241
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,079
phenotypic level

1242
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,240
um i think that they're probably the

1243
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,160
most important distinction within each

1244
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,079
of the big five in terms of discriminant

1245
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,839
validity in other words

1246
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,520
you often get things that are predicted

1247
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
differently at

1248
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,000
that level um so for example uh

1249
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,839
politeness and compassion are the two

1250
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,839
aspects of agreeableness

1251
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,560
and well it turns out that uh if you

1252
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,640
look at people's political orientation

1253
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,800
people who identify as more left-wing or

1254
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
liberal uh

1255
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,800
score higher in compassion people who

1256
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
identify as higher

1257
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
in uh conservatism

1258
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
uh more right-wing score higher in

1259
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,200
politeness

1260
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,520
right so conservatives are more polite

1261
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,119
liberals are more compassionate

1262
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,319
well what happens when you go up to

1263
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,760
agreeableness you see no correlation

1264
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,040
with political attitudes which people

1265
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,520
found

1266
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
surprising for a long time because it's

1267
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,800
you know issues around altruism and

1268
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
cooperation seem very relevant to

1269
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,440
political

1270
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,400
issues and policy well so it turns out

1271
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,920
that that's because something lower than

1272
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
the big five actually is associated with

1273
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,079
uh with political attitudes in opposite

1274
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,000
directions so i definitely think that

1275
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,680
these lower levels of the hierarchy can

1276
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,800
be useful

1277
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
um you know there's less

1278
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,040
the the evidence for the big five is

1279
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,119
remarkably extensive right whereas the

1280
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,319
evidence for that next

1281
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,800
level down that i've worked on is much

1282
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,920
less extensive

1283
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,560
nonetheless you know again i think there

1284
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
isn't just one way to carve this system

1285
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,240
up because the patterns of

1286
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,720
inter-relatedness are so complicated

1287
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,200
and i do think that these are useful uh

1288
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,760
useful

1289
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
sub-dimensions at any rate even if you

1290
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,000
could focus on others

1291
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,119
so i'll i'll leave that there cool

1292
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,720
thanks marco then scott

1293
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,760
thanks um so the last few comments were

1294
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,359
very very thoughtful

1295
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,119
um so so let me know if i ramble on for

1296
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,880
too long um

1297
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,680
so so i love metaphors so if you don't

1298
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,400
mind i'll try to provide a

1299
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,440
complimentary one so instead of

1300
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,920
maybe landscapes um i have this thing

1301
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,880
with imagining

1302
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,000
the brain as one big dynamical system

1303
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,880
and so all those dynamical flows or

1304
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,800
patterns they need to of course be

1305
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,560
a pattern to order structured and

1306
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,480
adaptive sense so

1307
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,079
this kind of trick structure could maybe

1308
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,160
be seen as

1309
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,160
kind of a kind of grip kind of handle

1310
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,920
kind of heuristic

1311
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,520
um well of gravity to kind of

1312
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,280
heuristically bias particular dynamics

1313
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,920
and at least for me uh that would make

1314
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,400
sense

1315
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,680
because of these um big five factors

1316
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,720
um being quite quite segregated in terms

1317
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
of where i think they would be relevant

1318
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
and that gives me back to the matter of

1319
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,760
personality and and

1320
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
kind of anti-moralization because i

1321
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
agree that there's a big problem

1322
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,560
of our theory laden in the manner in

1323
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,319
which we approach psychology

1324
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,359
um and that also uh

1325
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,400
should exhibit itself in as mentions the

1326
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,280
observations when it comes to animals um

1327
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
but for example when it comes to

1328
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
conscientiousness as adam already

1329
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,599
very nice pointed out there's a matter

1330
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,760
of death and i think

1331
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,599
i think he did allude to it but another

1332
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,440
thing to emphasize is also

1333
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,440
um the kind of field or or a range of

1334
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,720
possible alternatives to

1335
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,839
to care about to someone who would be

1336
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,560
low on contentiousness or carefree would

1337
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,119
perhaps

1338
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,040
uh not simply be lacking

1339
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,480
goal-orientedness

1340
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,839
but be more um aware of in touch

1341
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,880
or have a bigger affinity with the

1342
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,079
notion of play

1343
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,359
of simply uh engaging in behavior that

1344
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,319
is

1345
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,000
reducing expected free energy

1346
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,880
yet um not necessarily defined in terms

1347
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,240
of a particular goal

1348
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,359
right so not all animals would have

1349
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,520
to deal with that right because the

1350
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,720
evolutionaries simply

1351
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,079
aren't trained or evolved to have uh uh

1352
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,720
awareness or sensitivity to a multitude

1353
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,400
of possibilities in what to do in

1354
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,520
environments

1355
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,160
and so the very emergence of a

1356
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,920
particular big five factor might be also

1357
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,960
related to

1358
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,319
the complexity or the kind of yeah

1359
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,319
the complexity of the imperatives that

1360
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,680
they may encounter

1361
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,079
in their life in their niches so

1362
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,720
one may be interesting example is like

1363
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,319
dogs or other social animals

1364
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,319
uh although in general i don't think it

1365
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,760
would be appropriate to

1366
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
project or impose uh our entrepreneurial

1367
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,079
notion of personality

1368
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,920
i do think at least dog owners can agree

1369
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
that dogs tend to have a personality

1370
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,359
that seems to

1371
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,839
develop or evolve and even seemingly be

1372
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,280
similar to their owners

1373
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,200
possibly because the imperatives of

1374
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,040
their environment is expanded

1375
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
by being in relation with human agents

1376
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,880
and so by the expansion of of possible

1377
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
niches possible situations

1378
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,079
um the relevance or the variation uh

1379
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,240
specific to what consensus is

1380
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
is a relevant factor uh becomes more

1381
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,839
apparent whereas

1382
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,599
uh previously that might not be the case

1383
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,119
if that makes sense

1384
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,960
um yeah i'll leave that that because i

1385
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,720
forgot all everything else i wanted to

1386
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,040
say

1387
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
no it's really interesting that it's uh

1388
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
big five is not the essence of an

1389
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,319
individual it's actually

1390
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,559
in a cybernetic framework making the

1391
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,319
individual's phenotype in relationship

1392
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,839
to the goals and the context of their

1393
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,480
niche

1394
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,160
so it actually moves away from some of

1395
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,839
the essentialist types of critiques that

1396
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,559
people might

1397
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,800
naively bring up against big five we're

1398
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
looking at this as an empirical pattern

1399
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
with a generative underlying cybernetic

1400
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,240
reality so scott

1401
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,839
then adam than anyone else so

1402
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,480
fantastic conversation the couple of

1403
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,440
observations one

1404
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,400
personality is for a person and so it's

1405
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,599
kind of interesting when we take

1406
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,640
personality and

1407
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,800
impose it on other systems right i'm

1408
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,160
just playing linguistics there a little

1409
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,640
bit

1410
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
but in a way we what is the delta

1411
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,359
between personality and living

1412
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,400
formality i wonder

1413
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
so that might be in because are we

1414
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,000
assuming the human elements again it's

1415
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,599
that subjectivity question

1416
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,119
one of the things also it occurred to me

1417
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,400
that fristen it kind of

1418
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,119
allows for a notion of situated

1419
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,400
personality

1420
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,599
beyond situated cognition and so maybe

1421
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,480
those are

1422
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,079
overlapping maybe they're not i'm not

1423
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,079
sure if all um

1424
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,559
personality uh elements are seen as

1425
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,760
cognitive

1426
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,960
or if there's some things that are you

1427
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
know effective and hormonal and

1428
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,960
whatever other causation chains there

1429
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,000
are so many

1430
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,240
it's interesting that the um the

1431
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,680
behavioral elements

1432
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,880
we ascribe the personality um

1433
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,319
may or may not may not drive uh through

1434
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,200
all living systems

1435
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,520
i tend to define living systems and it's

1436
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,119
not anything

1437
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,640
reasoned it's just what i've done for

1438
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,680
the last 10 years and it's been

1439
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,960
effective for me is

1440
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,720
i define living systems as auto

1441
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,079
catalytic and

1442
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,200
entropy secreting so they can be in a

1443
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,800
variety of different forms and so i

1444
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,640
think of markets and corporations as

1445
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
living systems

1446
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,760
and so to me one of the questions that

1447
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,160
with with the definitions

1448
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,839
in the fristen notion we have kind of a

1449
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,000
fractal notion

1450
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,200
of uh things that are show scale

1451
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,400
independence i guess is one of the

1452
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,079
elements of fractal systems

1453
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,680
and so to what extent can

1454
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,040
the definition of using these

1455
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
personality traits at different levels

1456
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,440
help us understand the scale and

1457
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,680
dependent possibilities there

1458
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,920
so that's one issue then the last point

1459
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,119
these are kind of random but i think

1460
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,520
they're clustered around the idea of the

1461
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,720
model ascribing the last one is you know

1462
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,559
when we talk if i'm talking to daniel

1463
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,040
there's

1464
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
at least four identities involved there

1465
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,960
my sense of me

1466
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
his sense of me his sense of him and my

1467
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,400
sense of him

1468
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,160
so one of the challenges when you're

1469
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,319
talking to corporations markets

1470
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,640
maybe not dogs because they may have

1471
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,160
quality is that the other

1472
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,640
um the other entity doesn't have qualia

1473
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,760
if you're talking to a corporation it

1474
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,200
does not have quality the people in the

1475
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,559
corporation have qualia

1476
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
but but the corporation itself does not

1477
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,599
and so

1478
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,160
the um well that's obviously we can talk

1479
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,720
about that

1480
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,480
but my point is if they don't have

1481
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,800
qualia can they have empathy

1482
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,240
and if they don't have empathy maybe

1483
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,920
there are differences in kind

1484
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,200
up the fristen stack of fractal stack of

1485
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,240
living things

1486
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
and so maybe that is one way to start to

1487
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,599
distinguish between markets and

1488
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,280
corporations

1489
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,359
and again gets back to the animals issue

1490
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,200
do animals have qualia

1491
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,960
is the quality of their quality is

1492
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,400
slightly different than ours

1493
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,760
such that maybe there's a subset of

1494
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,200
personality that they'd

1495
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,000
show things like that um anyway just a

1496
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,280
couple of random thoughts i think but

1497
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,880
they again that definition of living

1498
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,040
beings i think is bound up in here

1499
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,280
and again not being to us not being too

1500
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,240
stubborn

1501
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,319
in our perspective that the personality

1502
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,079
is something that would describe all the

1503
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,440
attributes that work up and down the

1504
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,880
biological stack

1505
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,240
thanks cool we got adam then stephen

1506
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,960
marco colin

1507
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,160
so go ahead adam

1508
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,880
hi um hmm okay there's a lot uh

1509
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,599
to try to write it in for me um

1510
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,960
i like the so what marco was saying with

1511
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,760
this um basically this this attractor

1512
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
network formation

1513
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,160
perspective the supposed metaphor

1514
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,118
or a really good model the

1515
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
he mentioned like niche construction and

1516
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,480
he mentioned

1517
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,000
um i i think this

1518
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,079
perspective is really important in terms

1519
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,680
of thinking of

1520
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,319
the dynamic character of the processes

1521
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,359
that might give

1522
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,079
rise to these attractors over the course

1523
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,079
of development and situations and with

1524
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,200
development potentially being

1525
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,559
understandable in an

1526
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,520
open-ended sense that never stops um and

1527
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,079
so

1528
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,520
i guess along those lines i'm thinking

1529
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,839
of that causal process model

1530
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,160
that colin has in the original paper

1531
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,760
where it's going from genes and

1532
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,280
environment to

1533
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,559
you're having these cybernetic function

1534
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,640
and then traits and characteristic

1535
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,680
adaptations

1536
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,800
but then there's this feedback as

1537
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,160
and one way of understanding this

1538
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,079
feedback is as a kind of niche

1539
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:18,960
construction

1540
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,160
relationship where you're

1541
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,240
modifying your environment you're

1542
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,760
specializing yourself for these

1543
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,960
environments

1544
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,359
um as you're trying to like get along in

1545
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,079
the world as a goal seeking system

1546
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,200
um one more nice thing

1547
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
um with relation to what uh scott was

1548
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
saying i think that's actually

1549
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,920
uh yeah so i don't know also like while

1550
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,359
i'm interested in seeing like how far we

1551
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,720
can stretch personality i wouldn't want

1552
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,319
to overstate it either because

1553
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,000
there were major transitions in

1554
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
evolution and you know one of them would

1555
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,720
be

1556
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,760
um basically the ability to have

1557
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,119
certain types of generative modeling

1558
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,440
where there might be a qualia

1559
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,280
and quality of different varieties and

1560
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,720
then we might go beyond that not just

1561
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,480
qualia but things like

1562
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,720
access consciousness and if you like

1563
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,920
that distinction i do

1564
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,680
like being able to know your experience

1565
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,000
and report on it and things like being

1566
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,760
autonomic and being able to

1567
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,800
reflect on even your knowing um and so

1568
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,160
this would be

1569
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,559
very different cybernetic systems once

1570
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,000
you introduce this

1571
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,680
um so like you can have like and and

1572
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,760
if you have something like the big five

1573
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,880
showing up

1574
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,280
or the the big ten or the medium ten i

1575
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,359
don't know what you want to say but

1576
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,400
um they might show up differently

1577
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,440
so like you can think of like

1578
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,599
generalized agreeableness as like

1579
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,400
tendencies

1580
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,000
towards like non-zero um interaction and

1581
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,839
like not defecting in generalized game

1582
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:46,880
theory something like that

1583
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,280
like in a multi-agent context you're

1584
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,720
more of a cooperator

1585
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,000
and you you coordinate better but

1586
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,480
very different thing if you're actually

1587
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,720
having something like the feeling of

1588
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,680
compassion or empathy um these are

1589
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,000
different processes getting into the mix

1590
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,240
and you want a different handling and

1591
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,280
some things might not

1592
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,280
actually you want a very different

1593
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,319
handling

1594
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,319
yep interesting like would rather

1595
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,240
somebody act compassionately and be

1596
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,400
perceived as high percentile compassion

1597
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,799
or

1598
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,520
perceived overwhelming experience of

1599
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,720
compassion

1600
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,319
stephen marco colin

1601
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,720
yeah this brings in the idea of how

1602
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,240
people relate in a task-based

1603
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,280
environment or

1604
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,200
a more task-orientated environment i

1605
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,960
suppose where it might structure things

1606
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,319
a bit more clearly

1607
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,680
between the things in the world

1608
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
where the person is and whatever

1609
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,599
mechanism or structure

1610
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,240
is interacting between the two i am i

1611
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,920
picking up at all am i

1612
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,319
there's some sort of delineation one

1613
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,240
thing that sort of comes to mind

1614
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,440
when we talk about so you've got the

1615
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,920
generative model you've got these hidden

1616
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,760
states of the world

1617
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,440
and you've got this markov blanket and

1618
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,799
the thing with the markov blanket is

1619
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,559
unlike it's not a system boundary you

1620
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,400
never can really define it

1621
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,319
so you've got this and what i thought

1622
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,160
was quite interesting really when

1623
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,119
by having the stability and plasticity

1624
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,559
i'm seeing sort of

1625
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,280
the the plasticity with this

1626
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,280
extraversion which you could say is like

1627
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,119
influencing the hidden states in a way

1628
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,960
you're perturbing out there

1629
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,000
and the um the intellect is

1630
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
making models is is the sort of the

1631
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,280
other side

1632
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,799
but the the the the um stability

1633
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,040
in some ways is really stabilizing with

1634
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,480
the markov blanket

1635
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,480
like the the nature of the regime

1636
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,680
because you've got of got

1637
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,319
you know neuroticism is it like a is it

1638
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,160
a very hidden

1639
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,359
landscape of actually like inferring so

1640
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,119
maybe we because i'm really interested

1641
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,440
in how we might have mental space

1642
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,520
psychology approaches which there might

1643
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,760
be some sort of intervening

1644
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,680
um spatial mediator to how we process

1645
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,000
and that spatial mediator of how big and

1646
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,319
scary things are around us and

1647
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,839
in our metaphors it could be sort of

1648
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,839
mediating so the neuroticism the

1649
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,839
agreeableness to conscientiousness seem

1650
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:16,480
to have

1651
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,440
more structuring about how i might

1652
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,920
take data in through a markov blanket to

1653
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,440
the other side

1654
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,960
and the other two seem to have a bit

1655
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,680
more about what's out there

1656
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,240
and what's in here in a in a very crude

1657
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,880
way but

1658
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,079
that's what i'm that's just something

1659
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,359
that came up for me i thought was really

1660
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,400
interesting

1661
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,400
cool thank you marco collin blue thanks

1662
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,880
um yeah i i also want to build up on

1663
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,400
that so i fully agree

1664
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,599
um so so i think i think the pro

1665
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,640
the um prospects that are most

1666
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,440
attractive with

1667
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,760
this kind of approach to personality is

1668
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,079
as stephen alluded to that that you can

1669
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,520
uh associate these aspect factors

1670
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,280
into particular imperatives to

1671
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
particular challenges as it were

1672
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,240
um and uh i think it's nice to know to

1673
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,760
connect that with what was mentioned in

1674
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,040
the beginning about mars levels of

1675
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,079
analysis

1676
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,880
so um mars levels of analysis is a bit

1677
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,640
of a hot topic always

1678
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,160
um so so forgive me i'm a bit biased but

1679
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,599
personally i don't believe that active

1680
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,040
influence should be seen as

1681
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,839
quintessentially

1682
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,160
computational because i think it would

1683
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,559
discredit the fact that it implies a lot

1684
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,839
about um the algorithmic level so

1685
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,880
um just like uh steven kind of

1686
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,480
already said you could have these

1687
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,079
intermediate spaces right and that's

1688
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,520
basically asking you how

1689
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,760
these computational imperatives or

1690
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,839
functions are going to be realized

1691
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,520
um and i really want to emphasize the

1692
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,119
notion of mediation because i want to

1693
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,799
connect that to what scott was talking

1694
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:47,520
about

1695
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,079
so um it should be emphasized that from

1696
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:50,880
what i can tell

1697
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,000
this model of personality um is kind of

1698
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
neutral about consciousness right it

1699
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,520
doesn't we should be

1700
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,559
very very um mindful about not

1701
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,839
conflating

1702
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,359
the first person signs or

1703
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,160
perceptual models of how empathy arises

1704
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,280
within us

1705
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,240
with the process of empathy as such

1706
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,960
because

1707
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,720
if you see the pros of empathy within

1708
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,400
the brain then there's two ways to

1709
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,760
perceive it at the very least third

1710
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,559
person view

1711
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,200
from measures whether physiological or

1712
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,000
questionnaires

1713
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,200
and first person of course um and it

1714
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,480
stands to reason that that

1715
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,319
it's not necessary to have that first

1716
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,480
person encounter with these processes

1717
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880
for this process to happen but having

1718
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,680
said that

1719
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,280
it would be very interesting to to to

1720
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,599
imagine that consciousness would be

1721
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,079
like a sp intermediate in space as well

1722
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:40,960
such that

1723
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,200
the component factors and the respective

1724
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,160
challenges

1725
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,480
of the big five um can actually

1726
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,319
equilibrate in the sense of

1727
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,920
that it's not a trivial challenge to

1728
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,400
balance the respective aspects of these

1729
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,119
factors

1730
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,280
and the factors between each other for

1731
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,319
the uh

1732
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,040
autonomous being of concern and so it

1733
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,799
would stand to reason that indeed

1734
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,240
um there might be another intermediate

1735
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,240
space intermediate between these five

1736
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,119
factors

1737
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,799
which would emphasize the cybernetic

1738
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,880
function of something like

1739
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,760
consciousness as a space which i think

1740
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,880
it might be interesting for you scott

1741
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,480
because i think then you can generalize

1742
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,040
it

1743
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,559
for non-living beings or or composite

1744
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,200
organizations because if you then

1745
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,079
associate personality as heuristics

1746
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,760
for certain domains of challenges or

1747
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,440
domains of imperatives

1748
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,839
and then uh having to bind them together

1749
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,920
through a certain integrative space

1750
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,079
then you could have i think a very

1751
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,160
interesting approach to organizational

1752
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,280
science if that makes sense thanks

1753
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,040
that reminds me a lot of the projective

1754
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,200
consciousness model paper that we read

1755
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,799
in a previous active stream but it's

1756
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,880
almost like wondering if the cybernetic

1757
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
organisms or cybernetic systems other

1758
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,559
than organisms if they have a projective

1759
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:53,280
geometry

1760
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,520
do they also have that awareness so

1761
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,720
colin blue

1762
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,040
scott

1763
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,240
what i wanted to say actually ties in

1764
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
nicely to the point that marco was just

1765
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,920
making i was going to start by saying

1766
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,839
that i think it's important that

1767
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,240
the existence of personality is not

1768
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,440
dependent on

1769
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,799
the existence of qualia so

1770
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,040
this is a i think a mistake that people

1771
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,640
often make when they're considering

1772
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,720
the big five and similar personality

1773
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,839
systems they think oh well these are

1774
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,200
just about how people perceive

1775
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,720
themselves or how about how people

1776
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,200
perceive

1777
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,119
other people and maybe they're useful

1778
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,480
categories in terms of like what you

1779
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,079
need to know about a person

1780
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,839
but actually the claim is that you know

1781
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,119
assuming that these descriptions of

1782
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,640
people's behavior have validity

1783
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,400
they describe patterns of behavior that

1784
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,319
exist regardless of whether people

1785
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,119
are accurately aware of them or not and

1786
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,079
so you could have

1787
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,400
differences in you know persistent

1788
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,160
differences in behavior from organism to

1789
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,119
organism

1790
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,040
in any species that would be directly

1791
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,480
analogous to what we think of

1792
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,200
as personality in human beings now of

1793
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,640
course it is true that we have this

1794
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,480
additional layer in which

1795
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,280
one uh kind of characteristic adaptation

1796
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,960
that we have is that we tell a story

1797
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,880
about ourselves consciously

1798
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,400
and we can describe ourselves and we

1799
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,920
actually make use of that when we try to

1800
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,559
measures

1801
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,400
measure people's personalities because

1802
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,240
we you know often just ask them to

1803
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,280
describe themselves

1804
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,599
but we're not interested just in when in

1805
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,839
their description of themselves as such

1806
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,640
we're interested in or we hope and you

1807
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,920
know we know from a fair amount of

1808
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,480
evidence

1809
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,000
that those descriptions are reasonably

1810
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,079
accurate so it's not just that i think

1811
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,079
that i talk a lot i actually do talk a

1812
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:26,720
lot if you

1813
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,160
if you take some kind of objective

1814
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,599
measurement of that right that's part of

1815
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,839
what being extroverted is about

1816
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,039
um and so you know consciousness is

1817
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,720
obviously

1818
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,920
something that well is mysterious in

1819
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,280
various ways but i think that you know

1820
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,319
if we

1821
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,680
focus on that division between the easy

1822
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,039
and hard problems of consciousness i

1823
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,799
think we actually have some pretty

1824
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,000
important things to say about the

1825
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,760
so-called easy problems of consciousness

1826
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,240
like

1827
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,480
how does it function what does it do um

1828
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,319
and you know i think marco is right that

1829
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,440
one of the things that consciousness

1830
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,480
does is allow

1831
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,799
people to deal with conflicting

1832
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,039
information conflicting goals and to to

1833
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,559
create a sufficiently broad

1834
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,319
model of the world and our attention of

1835
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,000
it that we can then control

1836
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,880
our attention effectively i really like

1837
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,160
jeffrey gray's

1838
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,880
uh perspective on consciousness his last

1839
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,400
book was just called consciousness

1840
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,240
creeping up on the hard problem

1841
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,280
um that's really excellent and then uh

1842
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,160
i also like uh what is his name michael

1843
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,280
graziano's

1844
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,880
theory of consciousness it ties in very

1845
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,039
nicely to this idea that a cybernetic

1846
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:31,920
system

1847
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,240
uh to be a good cybernetic system you

1848
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,280
have to have some kind of physical

1849
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,960
representation of the variables that are

1850
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,240
being controlled that's the good

1851
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,839
regulator theorem

1852
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,400
um and so i think that one useful way to

1853
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,799
think about consciousness

1854
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:43,760
consciousnesses as

1855
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,559
a model of our attentional field that

1856
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,920
allows us to

1857
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,160
uh direct our attention effectively to

1858
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,680
things that are important for our goals

1859
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,720
or things that are potentially

1860
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,720
conflicting between goals

1861
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,079
and so in that sense yes it would

1862
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,000
certainly be relevant to

1863
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,079
conflicts that arise because of

1864
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,000
different needs or goals that are

1865
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,319
related to different personality traits

1866
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,920
but it's not something external to the

1867
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,359
traits mechanistically because the

1868
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,319
traits

1869
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,799
are descriptions of patterns of

1870
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,319
variation that you know

1871
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,640
in a population and so when we ascribe

1872
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,000
them to the person the person has a

1873
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,200
level of the trait

1874
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,440
and so those traits actually should be

1875
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,680
reasonably comprehensive descriptors of

1876
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,079
functioning in all the important you

1877
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,920
know categories of human function and

1878
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,520
that includes consciousness

1879
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,319
and in fact if you look at the contents

1880
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,079
of the big five openness and intellect

1881
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,440
is the trait that is really

1882
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,480
uh related to the qualities of

1883
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,520
consciousness

1884
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,839
people who are high in openness have are

1885
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,200
conscious of more things their

1886
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,000
consciousness

1887
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,799
is broader it's deeper it's more complex

1888
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,280
um

1889
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,119
and you know so there's the openness

1890
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,799
side of that trait in the intellect side

1891
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,160
and so you've got this sort of pattern

1892
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,799
detection

1893
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,440
and then pattern analysis and all that

1894
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,880
is basically about

1895
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,119
uh in large part the qualities of our

1896
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,280
consciousness

1897
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,200
cool very interesting blue then scott

1898
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,839
then adam

1899
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,400
so i am going to totally bypass

1900
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,920
consciousness because it's just

1901
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,119
uh it's a hard problem right but um i do

1902
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:13,599
want to

1903
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,920
to just consider for a minute what would

1904
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,680
happen if we

1905
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,480
maybe maps like not not asking what is a

1906
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,480
person but what is an individual

1907
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,359
could we then like scale over like

1908
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,880
non-human systems

1909
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,440
like you know organizations or even to

1910
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,920
other

1911
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,480
animals like adam brought up like major

1912
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,640
transitions in evolution and how do

1913
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,079
these like personality

1914
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,000
traits maybe influence evolution that

1915
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,680
would be interesting to think about like

1916
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,920
can we think of maybe clams as like

1917
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,200
ultra neurotic

1918
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,599
features and ants as like high in

1919
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,720
conscientiousness

1920
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,039
could we take like these personality

1921
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,280
traits and map them onto

1922
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,960
organisms you know that have evolved

1923
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,960
over time and and what would that look

1924
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,920
like in terms of

1925
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
of evolution and what what is essential

1926
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,680
you know openness to exploration is

1927
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,640
obviously key

1928
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,000
for you know some of the major

1929
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
transitions to happen

1930
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,440
that reminds me of the principal

1931
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,280
components the big fives um

1932
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,480
they're based upon the patterns of

1933
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,240
empirical variation in the actual

1934
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,280
population as

1935
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,200
colin brought up and then the animal

1936
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,039
spirits are

1937
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,640
without making a metaphysical claim

1938
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,960
they're like archetypes like of bravery

1939
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,400
or of extraversion or

1940
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,520
social butterfly or you know a couch

1941
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,200
potato it's still a living creature it's

1942
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,799
a potato it's in the ground

1943
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,200
and so how we model different types of

1944
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,280
metaphors it's like that's on our

1945
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,359
procrustean bed but then what does it

1946
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,960
look like to have it on their

1947
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,880
procrusty in bed for their personalities

1948
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,000
or individualities

1949
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,520
so scott then um

1950
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,680
marco then colin blue i love the notion

1951
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,960
of neurotic clams

1952
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,079
that's my favorite

1953
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,920
um yeah this is this is great and just

1954
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,359
along the same lines a couple of things

1955
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,480
that leaped into my head i was thinking

1956
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,000
of irving goffman stuff where you

1957
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,440
project yourself out as you want to be

1958
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,480
perceived

1959
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,400
so that's kind of you're modifying your

1960
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,240
environment in terms of the persona

1961
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,760
perception

1962
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,440
um that was one thing then also there's

1963
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,079
a lot of self other things in here the

1964
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,160
identity kind of notion and that and

1965
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,240
that idea of presentation of self

1966
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,520
one of the things i was wondering about

1967
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,319
is the dsm diagnostic statistical manual

1968
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,160
dsm-5 just came out

1969
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,599
and really how it plays into the um

1970
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,200
what i guess they would define as

1971
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,520
anomalous persona

1972
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,559
traits um and usually dsm seems to be

1973
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:29,680
the ones that aren't

1974
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,039
the ones that make you not productive in

1975
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,960
the capitalist society kind of things

1976
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,079
because there's a lot of things in there

1977
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,359
you call cultural in there but it's

1978
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:36,000
interesting

1979
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,119
that those are the outer bounds of uh

1980
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,079
what's expected expectations of persona

1981
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,480
and i think a lot of the survivalness

1982
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,880
questions have to do with expectations

1983
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,680
and the uh

1984
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,799
the rising of these variables in the

1985
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,440
corollaries in animals and in people

1986
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,200
have to do with survival and

1987
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,680
increasingly social survival but also

1988
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,440
just that survival of the organism

1989
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,480
and so that idea of presentation of self

1990
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,240
uh might be even related to camouflage

1991
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,599
and issues of that you know how do you

1992
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,359
present yourself or not present yourself

1993
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,480
in society

1994
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,000
so anyway that just that host of

1995
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,799
thoughts that how that naturally evolved

1996
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,719
is kind of interesting also this is and

1997
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,238
this is not a a

1998
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,600
studied thing i'm not an expert on this

1999
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,279
but just functionally again

2000
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,560
i think of the um mind

2001
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,120
and consciousness well i think put

2002
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,040
consciousness aside just like blue said

2003
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,960
but i think of the mind as not in the

2004
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,880
brain i think the mind as in language

2005
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
and material culture and the brain as an

2006
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,000
antenna

2007
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,960
tuned into the local mind so if you're

2008
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,520
my

2009
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,920
sister adopted a child at the age of

2010
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,600
five months and now she's a

2011
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,439
was raised in central pennsylvania and

2012
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,198
she was adopted from china she doesn't

2013
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,479
speak chinese she speaks spanish in

2014
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,238
english she's a u.s

2015
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,839
person but she looks like a chinese

2016
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,640
person so that their mind was developed

2017
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,600
in

2018
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,279
in in the in pennsylvania and so

2019
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,759
if there's no feral consciousness which

2020
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:02,719
let's take that as an

2021
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,839
assumption for a second with no feral

2022
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,600
mind and if it's a learned phenomenon

2023
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,279
it's interesting that we have this

2024
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,040
framing and then we

2025
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,759
keep re-upping the framing reaffirming

2026
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,319
and valorizing the framing

2027
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,839
it's interesting to wonder if there's a

2028
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:20,560
lag

2029
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,120
in terms of survivability what were the

2030
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,238
persona

2031
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,560
characteristics that were selected for

2032
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,839
and i don't just mean

2033
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,640
in biological evolution but socially are

2034
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,399
they identical to the ones that will be

2035
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,158
selected for in a much more

2036
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,080
dense interaction environment for

2037
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,759
instance so there may be some

2038
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,040
interesting questions

2039
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,479
if and to the extent that persona is not

2040
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,198
on board in the brain inherently but is

2041
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:45,600
a

2042
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,198
learned social phenomenon what is the

2043
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,679
how malleable is it and i mean i guess

2044
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,439
that's what education is about and why

2045
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,360
colonialists try to get indigenous

2046
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,040
people in their schools

2047
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,040
their children in schools early to

2048
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,520
render the externality innocuous

2049
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,640
but it'd be interesting from a

2050
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,640
perspective of

2051
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,400
current situations that we have in

2052
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
current policy challenges and public

2053
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,239
health challenges etc

2054
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,320
information challenges how might we

2055
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,440
handle those

2056
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,480
recognizing a more plastic uh

2057
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,760
persona so just a few thoughts

2058
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,320
cool interesting marco colin adam

2059
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,480
thanks um wait i forgot what i was gonna

2060
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,839
we'll come back

2061
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,040
okay well i think that there are

2062
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,199
certainly uh i mean certainly true that

2063
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,320
there are aspects of the mind and

2064
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,560
personality that are learned but then

2065
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,000
uh there are others that are

2066
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,040
evolved essentially and sufficiently

2067
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,120
genetically programmed that they would

2068
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,800
be present even in

2069
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,640
you know feral children but

2070
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,600
and that connection back to the idea of

2071
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,760
the evolution of personality uh when i

2072
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,159
when

2073
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,760
you know blue is talking about neurotic

2074
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,040
clams i was thinking about some of the

2075
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,320
work that's actually been done

2076
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,120
on the evolution of personality and

2077
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,080
animals

2078
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,000
some of it is very interesting there's a

2079
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,840
really nice paper from

2080
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,159
oh i know almost 15 years ago now by

2081
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,679
daniel nettle that talks about the

2082
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,960
evolution of

2083
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,280
personality and humans and other animals

2084
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,480
and so one of the things that he talks

2085
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,159
about are these experiments

2086
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,920
uh where you take uh a bunch of fish

2087
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,120
and you if you just

2088
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,480
naturalistically observe them you will

2089
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,679
see that there are differences in

2090
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:34,960
personality some of the fish are

2091
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,159
relatively bold

2092
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,239
some of them are relatively timid and

2093
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,760
cautious

2094
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,280
and what you can see is that if you

2095
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,800
systematically manipulate their

2096
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,159
environment you can actually

2097
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,440
change uh evolution of that population

2098
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,480
over time

2099
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,159
in interaction with the personalities of

2100
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,920
the individual and so the way that i

2101
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,679
think about this is that personalities

2102
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,360
drive evolution but evolution also

2103
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,880
drives changes in personalities at the

2104
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,159
population level

2105
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,480
so what happens is that if you have a if

2106
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,920
you have those fish in an environment

2107
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,440
that has a lot of predators

2108
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,400
then the bold ones get eaten and the

2109
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,000
frequency of the more

2110
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,600
cautious timid ones increases in the

2111
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,840
population but if you put them in an

2112
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,920
environment that has very few predators

2113
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,920
then what happens is that the bold ones

2114
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,760
uh tend to monopolize a lot more

2115
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,320
resources and the frequency of the

2116
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,520
bold personalities increases in the

2117
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,880
population yes

2118
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,679
so always the ecological selection on

2119
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,760
the development of personality not even

2120
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,960
just personality

2121
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,239
something that can be reached out and

2122
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,719
grasped but actually how personality

2123
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,000
becomes developed in relation so adam

2124
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,520
then marco then stephen

2125
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,120
try to tie together a few threads before

2126
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,840
i lose him um

2127
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,360
so like earlier i was saying

2128
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,679
um you know evolution is one of multiple

2129
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:54,880
perspectives but

2130
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,760
a really special perspective and it is a

2131
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,360
really special perspective

2132
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,719
like i it almost makes me move towards

2133
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,640
like well on some level i'm uh

2134
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,920
an instrumentalist um but with respect

2135
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,040
to like the things like

2136
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,880
what is the ontological status of the

2137
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,320
markov blanket

2138
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
i think there is also like a realism

2139
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,440
like

2140
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,000
realism and maybe a realism so strong we

2141
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,280
couldn't sometimes throw away with the

2142
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,080
word quasi

2143
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,040
we should always kind of keep it in our

2144
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,120
back pockets and that we should keep

2145
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,239
keep in mind that there are multiple

2146
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,480
ways of carving up the world actually

2147
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,000
infinite ways it's just some are going

2148
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,159
to be more or less good for being such

2149
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,280
as us and

2150
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,040
one really good carving would be the one

2151
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,040
that basically

2152
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,560
relates to functional cycles that

2153
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,719
achieve closure on time scales where

2154
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,840
they can be subject to

2155
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,040
cumulative evolution broadly construed

2156
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,960
whether being the development

2157
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,560
of the organism or phylogeny and so

2158
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,080
uh what that might uh

2159
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,280
pick out some particularly uh

2160
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,199
universally agreed upon while still

2161
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,040
subjective joints

2162
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,320
but to kind of bring it together more

2163
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,040
among those

2164
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,760
and with relation to your personality

2165
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,360
characteristics there's an interesting

2166
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,880
thing that can happen for

2167
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,400
species capable of modeling each other

2168
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,080
and themselves with a certain kind of

2169
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,679
richness having certain types

2170
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,840
of consciousness in the sense of

2171
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,880
knowledge

2172
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,920
where um and even without it potentially

2173
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,960
that they can become aware of these

2174
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,080
reliable

2175
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,520
course screenings of themselves and

2176
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,199
others and then

2177
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,120
this forms a basis for your planning

2178
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,040
and then this forms a basis for

2179
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,880
basically not just the niches that

2180
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,840
you're trying to construct but the way

2181
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,840
your niche is constructing you

2182
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,840
and so for all this like active

2183
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,520
inference with its like embrace

2184
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,000
an embracing of circular causality and

2185
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
this mutuality between like system and

2186
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,360
environment in terms of

2187
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,640
each being its own kind of active

2188
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,400
inferential system and exploring this

2189
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,199
interplay

2190
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,199
i think that's really essential for

2191
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,560
understanding personality in both the

2192
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,280
specific

2193
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,400
and the general case uh before i'll

2194
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,480
let you all move on like one final uh

2195
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,760
set of threads

2196
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,360
i would be like when talking about

2197
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,800
something like consciousness so like

2198
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,960
i recently kind of took on the hard

2199
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,080
problem uh

2200
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,080
it has debated how much success i had

2201
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,840
but in trying to make way on this

2202
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,520
um it seems useful to

2203
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,320
not uh and probably with respect to

2204
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,000
discussions of personality

2205
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,199
um all of our words are just words

2206
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,800
they're uh course screenings that we

2207
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,719
agree upon um

2208
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,760
and they don't exist in the world and so

2209
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,960
consciousness part of the

2210
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,560
issue is like we mean very different

2211
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,560
things when we use the word sometimes

2212
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,920
and so um so similar so you might say

2213
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,400
um scott was suggesting like you know is

2214
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,600
um

2215
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,719
we might want to distinguish between

2216
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,640
mind and consciousness or intelligence

2217
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,920
in consciousness

2218
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,480
and so you could say like your mind is

2219
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,440
distributed

2220
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,920
through the world and that your brain is

2221
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,880
an antenna

2222
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,600
i think that's a good perspective but if

2223
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,719
you're thinking of like

2224
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,040
consciousness as like a type of model

2225
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,239
where there's something that it's like

2226
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,760
from the inside to be that

2227
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,159
kind of modeling process that might not

2228
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,199
be extended

2229
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,120
that might be like a subsystem and a sub

2230
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,719
model um

2231
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,800
and so it's similar we're kind of

2232
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,040
building up this onion of complexity

2233
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,280
with respect to consciousness and people

2234
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,320
are kind of kind of

2235
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,080
engaging at different levels but not

2236
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,440
always being clear on the level that

2237
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,719
they're engaging it

2238
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,239
and so you could so recently um i was

2239
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:35,600
engaging at the level of like

2240
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,880
basic phenomenality itself um and

2241
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,480
uh rudroff and like projected

2242
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,400
consciousness models very similar spirit

2243
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,440
um it's uh you know specifically uh

2244
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,120
what are the ways we can describe your

2245
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,120
subjectivity as a particular reference

2246
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,280
frame and point of view in the world

2247
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,840
as you as a cybernetic system how can we

2248
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,199
characterize that

2249
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,640
and so then we go like another level

2250
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,159
still we're getting what colin's talking

2251
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,440
about with things like

2252
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,480
attention schemas and like

2253
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,120
models of your awareness for for

2254
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,520
modeling yourself and others and shared

2255
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,880
uh and shared attention schemas and so i

2256
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,360
guess the

2257
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,280
go further still into things like

2258
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
self-consciousness reflexive

2259
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,080
self-consciousness

2260
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,560
and each of these will be kinds of major

2261
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,760
transitions

2262
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,920
in evolution and development which i

2263
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,159
understand as a kind of evolution

2264
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,199
and each of these will

2265
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,360
now dock with personality in different

2266
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,400
ways

2267
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,360
um now i guess the one final thing with

2268
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,719
um

2269
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,920
that's interesting uh is the way

2270
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,480
in which personality traits if you're

2271
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,600
thinking them as kind of

2272
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,080
coarse screenings it's like with like

2273
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,840
coarse grain descriptions

2274
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,000
and it's a one key core screen you can

2275
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
core screen when you have something like

2276
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,760
a renormalization process when you have

2277
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,360
some sort of like emergent attractor

2278
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,640
structure

2279
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,280
um such that the lower level or the

2280
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,280
smaller fluctuations

2281
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,199
uh smaller dynamics can be kind of like

2282
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,320
averaged out

2283
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,360
because now you're pointing at this

2284
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,520
bigger thing and the bigger slower

2285
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,600
attracting manifold didn't care about

2286
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,800
the particulars

2287
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,960
so uh rather that's not relevant for

2288
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,920
this

2289
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,360
course or phenomena that you're trying

2290
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,000
to observe and so

2291
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,280
there's a sense in which um

2292
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,040
personality is a kind of correspondence

2293
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,719
like what are the nature of these like

2294
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,000
normalization processes and so one of

2295
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,320
them

2296
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,800
it would seem like so what is inducing

2297
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,960
this attracting structure

2298
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,640
it seems like a good part of it would be

2299
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,000
so you can model yourself

2300
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,239
across situations so you know what kind

2301
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,679
of agent am i

2302
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,679
that i am likely to be doing what and

2303
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,960
what circumstances

2304
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,320
and this will be pretty essential for

2305
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,640
pursuing any kind of complex plan

2306
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,440
but similarly for coordination um other

2307
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,159
or

2308
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,640
working around other agents um or

2309
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,679
cooperation or

2310
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,159
competition what kind of agent is this

2311
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,360
i'm dealing with

2312
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,960
but for the sake of cooperation you

2313
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,800
might you know ask someone

2314
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,159
to be uh uh responsible

2315
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,159
they should be able to respond and

2316
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,199
report

2317
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,400
in in a reliable and consistent way

2318
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,560
we actually demand of each other in a

2319
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,440
way

2320
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,600
a certain non-erratic character we we

2321
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,600
demand dimensionality reduction of each

2322
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,239
other

2323
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,920
um just because otherwise we get

2324
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,760
surprised and as a friendly principal

2325
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,120
and active infrastructures we don't like

2326
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,400
being surprised

2327
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,239
um because then we can't plan and then

2328
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,679
we can't outsource our cybernetic

2329
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,400
entropy

2330
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,360
and it's it's bad so there's a sense in

2331
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,960
which um

2332
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,360
to what degree like there's this the

2333
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,360
same way that like personality traits

2334
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,199
are influencing they're emerging from

2335
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,719
evolution then influencing the course of

2336
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:45,760
evolution

2337
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,920
with development uh your personality

2338
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,600
traits are emerging from your

2339
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,000
interaction

2340
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,199
with your environment as you're carving

2341
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,040
out this niche um

2342
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,360
but also they can also become like

2343
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,280
attracting targets and of themselves on

2344
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,880
different levels like if you're

2345
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,600
uh if you have this expectation of

2346
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,080
yourself

2347
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,920
as being this type of agent it could be

2348
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,520
a self-fulfilling prophecy

2349
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,920
i think i'm a neurotic agent i think i'm

2350
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,880
an extrovert agent

2351
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,400
now other people think i'm neurotic

2352
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,520
agents other people think i'm an

2353
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,560
extroverted agent

2354
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,840
and now they're treating me a certain

2355
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,199
way and i'm acting a certain way and

2356
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:16,080
this

2357
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,920
and then it keeps going um yes

2358
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,440
a lot of things you know a lot of no a

2359
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,800
lot of awesome stuff that reminds me of

2360
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,520
the scripts

2361
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,440
it reminds me of the phrase uh the

2362
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,480
common saying the absolute power to act

2363
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,560
absolutely brings responsibility or

2364
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,840
something like that like power and

2365
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,960
responsibility but

2366
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,320
now we're talking about the power to act

2367
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,000
and the responsibility to stimuli

2368
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,800
and that means that we respond so um

2369
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,440
marco

2370
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,719
then stephen thanks

2371
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,760
um adam for that fantastic

2372
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,960
um so first um a bit of a meta

2373
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,679
comment or question so since you said we

2374
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,199
can't use the chat in stream

2375
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,840
um i've been putting some links in the

2376
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,679
youtube chat but i'm wondering if you

2377
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,840
had a recommended way to do that because

2378
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,040
a lot of people are mentioning a lot of

2379
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,239
interesting research

2380
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,960
and i think people are modest to the

2381
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,320
point that they won't advertise their

2382
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,520
own research or link it

2383
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,760
yeah um so what would you prefer daniel

2384
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,199
sure

2385
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,080
to respond yeah to respond to the meta

2386
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,440
and just to clarify so

2387
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,520
in the jitsi for the live stream it will

2388
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,880
make a

2389
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,800
if you use the chat so it's very

2390
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,639
disruptive to use the chat during the

2391
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,360
jitsi

2392
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,199
so the single source of truth for the

2393
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,040
video is the youtube page

2394
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,600
or on keybase so definitely everybody

2395
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,360
should make a keybase username and join

2396
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,120
us at

2397
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,679
actinflab.public and check out

2398
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:36,159
activeactiveinference.org to find out

2399
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:36,719
more but

2400
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,120
the key base at this point is our actual

2401
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,320
organizational hub

2402
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,920
so that's where we're doing the open

2403
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,159
participatory active inference lab

2404
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,600
like this is a project of the

2405
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,360
communications branch of active

2406
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,480
inference lab

2407
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,719
continue okay thank you yeah i didn't

2408
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,400
know but key basis but thank you glad i

2409
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,040
asked

2410
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,600
um yeah so building on saffron's uh

2411
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,719
great comments

2412
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,239
um so i fully agree that personality is

2413
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,000
definitely something scaffolded right

2414
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,520
um so um personally i

2415
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,920
i i i do see this at the the relevance

2416
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,199
of of course spreading but i think it's

2417
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,080
also um

2418
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,000
maybe interesting to use another uh

2419
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
example or metaphor

2420
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,679
of bootstrapping so um

2421
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,719
one interesting thing is so an ai keep

2422
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,560
dealing with interactability but clearly

2423
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,000
we are still

2424
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,679
living and not defying laws of

2425
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,520
computation so

2426
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,600
um there needs to be this kind of leak

2427
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,679
of faith of how to start off

2428
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,480
acting around in the world uh and so so

2429
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,280
so

2430
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,040
one way to see it instead of terms of

2431
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,719
course grading in terms of temporal

2432
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:39,520
scale

2433
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,639
maybe it's simply um then put it this

2434
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,040
way

2435
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,120
it's going to behave over time over time

2436
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
over time across different contexts

2437
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,120
there should be overlap in the kind of

2438
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,960
parameters or hyperparameters

2439
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,719
that govern your behavior approach to

2440
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,159
the world and

2441
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,320
those that are more consistent or more

2442
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,080
covariance or synergetic

2443
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,400
they will consolidate into this kind of

2444
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,679
heuristic

2445
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,199
core to further elaborate and specify

2446
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,920
um and on top of that building answer

2447
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,280
that i was wondering because adam

2448
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,960
earlier asked colin if you could maybe

2449
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,520
uh

2450
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,120
explicitly map the uh the big five to

2451
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,080
mechanisms

2452
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,320
cybernetic or inferential terms but i

2453
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,520
was wondering if it's

2454
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,480
um appreciated or useful to also put the

2455
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:22,960
question

2456
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,480
for everyone since everyone's relatively

2457
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,400
familiar with active inference or

2458
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,840
fustonia terminology

2459
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,800
how they would characterize um the big

2460
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,800
five factors because mostly it's

2461
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,840
in very simplistic uh

2462
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,719
adjectives or purely behavioral but i

2463
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,320
think would be interesting to maybe

2464
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,920
at least attempt faithfully to

2465
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,920
understand them from the inside out

2466
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,320
right what kind of functions or

2467
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,560
processes or inferential problems

2468
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,320
would be associated with them a few

2469
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,080
people already did that but i

2470
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,719
was wondering if people would like to uh

2471
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,320
do that more

2472
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,520
explicitly uh together cool

2473
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,080
great question and also a lot of it is

2474
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,000
enclosed in the paper which is why this

2475
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,600
is so fun to have as a journal club

2476
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,960
because we can always

2477
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,280
superfluously add on top but then the

2478
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,880
paper also references a lot of these

2479
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,440
things

2480
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,320
so we'll go to steven colin scott

2481
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,719
yeah a lot of really cool stuff um i

2482
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:19,440
think

2483
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,560
um well as well as the modeling idea i

2484
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,840
think going back to this

2485
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,760
the the the idea of a timid fish and a

2486
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,159
bald fish and

2487
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,719
the affordances of the environment one

2488
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:31,840
thing that's really been

2489
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,920
i've been really striking me as has been

2490
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,360
trying to integrate

2491
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,320
um drama-based projects and sort of

2492
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,920
experiential workshops with

2493
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,040
psychology is is that

2494
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,880
you've got this kind of reflective

2495
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,040
perspectival

2496
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,719
aspect to psychology like you can take a

2497
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,400
perspective and reflect and you get a

2498
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,440
sense of it

2499
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,040
the big five will use that in the

2500
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,159
reporting um yeah it's tapping into

2501
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,800
some sub-personal dynamics and other

2502
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,159
dynamics which may not be

2503
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:05,120
available at the conscious reflective

2504
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,080
level

2505
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,560
and i think that that that then starts

2506
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,320
to get really interesting with the

2507
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,719
affordances again with the timid and

2508
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:13,840
bold

2509
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,600
and what's been talked of of how this

2510
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,239
all sort of scales because

2511
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,840
um it's not necessarily

2512
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,239
a timid generative model that creates

2513
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,040
the timing like

2514
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,239
if i take too many cups of coffee okay

2515
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,239
now my i don't know if it's my brain

2516
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,440
that's changed or whether it's the

2517
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,880
sensitivity to my

2518
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,360
um of my of my

2519
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,199
perceptual and active action reflexes

2520
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,120
which are kind of now or maybe my

2521
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,239
stomach or

2522
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,239
so you've got this um there's an

2523
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,320
interesting way with this that it can

2524
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,280
bring in

2525
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,600
the kind of the dynamics and the

2526
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,800
affordances and

2527
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,800
so one thing that's quite interesting in

2528
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,960
in this in theater you've got an acting

2529
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,639
method which is basically

2530
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,280
very like you hear a very text

2531
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,800
orientated and what did my character

2532
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,800
want to do but another way is you just

2533
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,440
actually get into the body of an animal

2534
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,840
so you be a spider

2535
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,520
and they actually have in the

2536
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,840
school they do like a set a whole series

2537
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,120
of weeks in the zoo

2538
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,520
and everyone has to be animals and

2539
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,600
inhabit animals bodies

2540
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,280
and but you know there's something

2541
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,199
different about if you're on four

2542
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,520
legs and you're moving around smelling

2543
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,639
things okay

2544
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,600
you're going to be balancing your inputs

2545
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,360
and your options and affordances for

2546
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,120
action

2547
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,960
are quite different right so it might

2548
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,639
well change the way

2549
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,000
um but it will change well i'm not going

2550
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,760
to speculate on that but just

2551
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,960
just basically coming back to the point

2552
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,800
of the timid and the bold and

2553
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,520
this idea that the the way the active

2554
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,280
inference or the inactive

2555
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,239
sort of dynamics of the body with the

2556
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,040
environment

2557
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,080
can be a lot of that could be sitting at

2558
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,360
a sub-personal level

2559
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,920
like you're not really sure how you know

2560
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,760
that bright light has affected my

2561
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,480
retinol

2562
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,360
or my tiredness has affected or my

2563
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,560
alcohol consumption

2564
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,760
you know some of these types of things

2565
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,080
so i thought i'd sort of say that that

2566
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,040
kind of

2567
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,360
can connect in with this the more

2568
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,040
consciousness

2569
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,880
reflective piece and the sort of

2570
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,080
phenomenological

2571
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,360
cybernetic subconscious piece

2572
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,880
cool colin scott adam

2573
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
i just wanted to say that the reason

2574
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,320
that i didn't take up

2575
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
adam's suggestion to go through each of

2576
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,400
the big five and talk about the

2577
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,320
cybernetic processes that we think are

2578
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,000
probably related to them is precisely

2579
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,800
that they

2580
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,159
you know that is all discussed in the

2581
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,600
paper i didn't want to take up a bunch

2582
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,800
of extra time of things that

2583
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,920
um many people have already read um

2584
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,520
in terms of this kind of idea of the you

2585
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,280
know the richness of the psychological

2586
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,880
processes that are underlying

2587
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,840
each of the big five that is something

2588
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,560
that

2589
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,400
you know it's true that a lot of people

2590
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,239
have this very shallow perspective on

2591
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:54,639
them

2592
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,040
um partly due to the way that they were

2593
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,560
derived in the first place and those

2594
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,400
stereotypes that people have about them

2595
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:00,960
as

2596
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,679
you know scientific entities but i could

2597
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:04,159
spend

2598
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,480
the rest of the livestream talking about

2599
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,199
these

2600
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,840
processes in great detail but i think

2601
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,440
would probably be better just to refer

2602
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,360
people to the original paper that i

2603
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,760
wrote in 2015 on cybernetic big five

2604
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,199
theory

2605
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,960
and then also maybe to a theory that we

2606
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,760
wrote on the cybernetic perspective on

2607
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,400
psychopathology

2608
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,960
because the big five turn out to be

2609
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,960
equivalent also to the major dimensions

2610
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,320
of risk for different forms of

2611
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,760
psychopathology and we talked a lot

2612
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,000
about the specifics that might be

2613
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,719
important there as well and that all all

2614
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,080
my papers or most of my papers are

2615
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,560
available on my website

2616
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,600
cool great and that's also why again the

2617
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,360
journal club format it's not the only

2618
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,120
format we're going to experiment with

2619
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,520
in active inference lab but this will

2620
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,880
actually allow us to

2621
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,960
have conversations that are rooted in a

2622
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,159
lot of specifics

2623
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,239
and various papers will be amenable to

2624
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,440
that in different ways

2625
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,960
so scott and then adam

2626
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,120
so and i wanted to apologize for not

2627
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,480
reading not having an opportunity to

2628
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,840
read the paper before this one so it

2629
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,280
would have been better informed had i

2630
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,080
done that

2631
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,520
one i wanted to um this just occurred to

2632
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:09,840
me

2633
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,360
something that might be going on here

2634
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,040
and it's a little bit stretched

2635
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,360
so let me give me a second here so this

2636
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,960
is going to be where i'm going with this

2637
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,320
is whether living forms are entropy

2638
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,560
engines okay that's where i'm going to

2639
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,520
go with this

2640
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,770
so um there was uh

2641
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:26,960
[Music]

2642
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,360
entropy i'm talking about now using

2643
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,960
shannon and von neumann

2644
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,000
and um entropy notions generally

2645
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,080
not by analogy but rather saying you're

2646
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,080
talking about general disorder and

2647
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,159
and so i'll be a little fast and loose

2648
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,679
with entropy for a second here

2649
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:44,960
so penrose wrote a paper a book recently

2650
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,360
we talked about the what we get from the

2651
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,159
sun is not

2652
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,639
energy but rather neg entropy because

2653
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,040
the yellow light of the sun comes in

2654
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,880
infrared light goes out the difference

2655
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,480
is the frequency the information

2656
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,159
carrying capacity of yellow light is

2657
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:58,639
higher

2658
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,800
because higher frequency and so it's a

2659
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,920
net energy

2660
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,920
neutral except for global warming or

2661
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,960
climate change

2662
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,199
but it's um what we get is the structure

2663
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,199
of plants reflects that

2664
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:12,239
higher neg entropy opportunity i guess

2665
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:13,360
is one way to put it

2666
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,480
so let's so starting with that um what

2667
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,800
if entropy was driving a lot more

2668
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,000
and so what if the um

2669
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,239
remember recall my definition of living

2670
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,719
forms as auto catalytic

2671
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,159
entropy secreting entities

2672
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,280
so if entropy universally is increasing

2673
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,400
living forms are localized neg entropy

2674
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,960
areas right they lower entropy locally

2675
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,600
and try to

2676
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,360
preserve it what if the the drive

2677
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,840
both the physical symbiogenesis

2678
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,000
where pre-existing bacteria migrate

2679
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,320
on board to eukaryotes and then become

2680
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,360
mitochondria

2681
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,480
in human in animals and

2682
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,960
chloroplasts in plants so they come

2683
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,719
together because it's a better deal

2684
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,480
basically a better way to be auto

2685
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,320
catalytic and entropy secreting at the

2686
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,760
larger scales

2687
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,719
what if that extends um to where we are

2688
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:09,679
now with the

2689
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,239
with the the what if those stage stages

2690
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:12,800
of perce

2691
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,360
personality have those functions we're

2692
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,719
saying they do

2693
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,520
and um then it has to do with both

2694
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,960
entropy accounting

2695
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,400
so when you're meeting someone who

2696
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,800
shares personality states or has

2697
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,560
predictable and ex

2698
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,320
personality states you can predict

2699
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,080
there's a lower um

2700
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,080
differential so from a second law of

2701
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,320
thermodynamics perspective

2702
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
you have like for carnot's equation you

2703
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,679
need a hot and cold differential to

2704
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:38,159
perform

2705
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,000
work what if the information

2706
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,440
differentials

2707
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,360
that you have between entities that are

2708
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,719
meeting each other

2709
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,239
help to cultivate various responses

2710
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,920
and those responses are we are

2711
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,600
cataloging in those

2712
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,480
five big persona traits and so that's

2713
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,440
ways of being or ways of encountering

2714
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,360
um so it helps you navigate the social

2715
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,800
landscape

2716
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,639
and um that the what what if what we

2717
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,800
have really is what i call an entropy

2718
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,600
engine

2719
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,239
which is that the personality goes out

2720
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:10,880
in the

2721
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,920
and harvests disorder um

2722
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,840
through these mechanisms dissipating it

2723
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,520
obviously but also

2724
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,639
um growing from it and what i mean by

2725
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:21,199
that is

2726
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:25,040
all institutions all of them are

2727
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,920
uh dis de-risk some subset of

2728
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,520
interactions whether it's grocery stores

2729
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,520
or hospitals or banks or whatever

2730
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,199
that's what institutions do at larger

2731
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,520
scale so they're neg entropy expressions

2732
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,880
at larger scales

2733
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,080
but we have those um those those feelers

2734
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,040
that go out

2735
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,360
and maybe the personality types and our

2736
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,400
physical attributes

2737
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,320
are the feelers that go out to figure

2738
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,840
out where there's opportunities

2739
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,880
for proliferation into a community of

2740
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,639
interest around a shared risk

2741
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,840
thanks wow very interesting with the

2742
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,480
jordan peterson the darkness into light

2743
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,639
ordering the universe and you know or

2744
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,800
disordered order as a thermodynamic

2745
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,679
inference

2746
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,360
process so hopefully that will be

2747
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,040
something we can like continue thinking

2748
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,400
about in our last

2749
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,600
20 minutes so we'll do adam then uh

2750
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,159
marco

2751
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:13,840
and anybody who's watching live can

2752
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,679
leave a comment anyone else who's on

2753
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:16,960
here can prepare any

2754
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,480
like last thoughts but this has been a

2755
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,840
super awesome discussion so adam then

2756
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,840
marco

2757
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,600
um with relation to entropy

2758
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,000
um you might want to check out the work

2759
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,719
of uh

2760
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,679
in terms of life jeremy england he has a

2761
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,120
really interesting

2762
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,080
handling of that's free energy principle

2763
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,040
compatible

2764
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,159
of entropy maximization and you might

2765
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:42,800
also

2766
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,639
enjoy terence deakins work colin

2767
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,960
hooked me up with him it's incomplete

2768
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,239
nature he gets into

2769
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,679
um discussions like cough uh

2770
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,239
auto cut discussions of auto catalysis

2771
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:57,600
like kaufman talks about

2772
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,800
and um uh work cycles as ways of like

2773
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,480
describing systems and their reality

2774
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,120
because

2775
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,159
you know if you're talking about

2776
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,280
realities you know differences that make

2777
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,880
a difference uh

2778
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,320
being able to contribute to a work cycle

2779
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,239
is a pretty good criteria

2780
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,320
and if we're able to identify system on

2781
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,960
some sense it's engaging probably

2782
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,400
in some kind of work cycle and you can

2783
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,920
do an entrap like a handling of it

2784
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,600
that's going to involve entropy

2785
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,880
uh also in terms of entropy um

2786
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,280
there is maybe two papers you might like

2787
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,159
one is um

2788
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,639
i posted them in the youtube uh feed

2789
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:29,760
which is um

2790
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,199
uh psychological entropy um from

2791
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:37,360
uh hirsch mar and peterson 2012

2792
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,679
and then a more recent attitudinal

2793
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:40,719
entropy framework

2794
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:44,000
um by daleigh bores boom harvard and

2795
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,880
van der masson forget my pronunciation

2796
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,920
uh but to

2797
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,760
now look back around to some of the

2798
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,960
things um that

2799
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,600
stefan was saying uh that still on some

2800
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,520
level abstraction will involve entropy

2801
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,040
um one of the places i'm actually really

2802
01:34:59,040 --> 01:34:59,920
thinking uh

2803
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,280
now into and trying to understand is uh

2804
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,040
the conditions under which personality

2805
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,119
might be more or less plastic

2806
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,639
the conditions under which you can get

2807
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,639
trait change altered traits

2808
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,040
um and not just altered states and uh

2809
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,199
along these lines of notions of like

2810
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,440
acting like technical acting versus

2811
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,480
method acting

2812
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,639
like to what extent is this sort of

2813
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:23,960
self-fulfilling like the

2814
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,520
self-perpetuating

2815
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,600
attractor dynamic that makes up persons

2816
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,199
and their personalities

2817
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:33,360
um to what extent

2818
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,800
uh is it changeable even if there are

2819
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,719
these enduring cybernetic

2820
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,400
parameters to what extent can you take

2821
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,880
those arrows and columns causal diagram

2822
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,280
and really work them so collins um

2823
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,239
basically

2824
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:47,760
talked about like if you want to have in

2825
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,440
his well-being work in his um

2826
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,679
uh psychopathology work um about

2827
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,600
character adaptations

2828
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
being where you have the most leverage

2829
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,360
like the things you tend to do

2830
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,360
the this like design of your life and

2831
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,639
the situations

2832
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,960
you show up in and how you show up and

2833
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,000
this is where you

2834
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,239
like or clinicians and yourself you

2835
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,440
might have the greatest purchase

2836
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,880
in an acting change um but

2837
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,239
and so this would work on multiple

2838
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,920
levels one would be like it would change

2839
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,199
the nature

2840
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,600
of what you experience and you know

2841
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,119
we're learners we update

2842
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,320
it would also change your niche

2843
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,159
construction and change the way that the

2844
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:23,679
the context in which you're in

2845
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,920
if you if you that would be leveraged

2846
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,880
there

2847
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,480
but um i guess to one more

2848
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,880
thought would be um and bring it back to

2849
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,840
consciousness

2850
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,679
um like to what extent

2851
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,800
it's it's not just chance so to change

2852
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,320
your characteristic adaptations

2853
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,760
would be to change the things you tend

2854
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,560
to do um but what you're describing this

2855
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,600
sort of like method

2856
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,480
acting view or are you bringing that up

2857
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,760
but like acting

2858
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,080
um what extent can personality be

2859
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,520
changed by

2860
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,239
really paying close attention to this

2861
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:00,560
what

2862
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,920
is it like to be me and actually

2863
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,199
and what could it be like to be a

2864
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,040
different kind of me

2865
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,239
and then imagine yourself

2866
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,560
in that way um i won't quite call it

2867
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,239
faking it until you make it but like

2868
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:17,440
um and to what degree

2869
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,679
is this a substantial part of how

2870
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,000
personality forms to begin with like

2871
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,639
children at play copying their parents

2872
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:25,840
pretending to be

2873
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,280
this fair that way but now the question

2874
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,199
would happen in the bootstrapping

2875
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,639
can we still leverage this um as adults

2876
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,520
and one thing along those lines would be

2877
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,320
um

2878
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,639
that makes me think you might be able to

2879
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,320
um i believe in the

2880
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,199
uh tibetan tradition though um i think

2881
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:44,639
it's part of jokes

2882
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:45,840
i don't know how to pronounce it but

2883
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,280
basically um they'll do these kinds of

2884
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,800
like uh deity practices where like let's

2885
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,760
say you have some kind of like

2886
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,119
affliction something that's like

2887
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,480
not working for you um you might pretend

2888
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,560
to be a kind of complementary

2889
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,920
uh deity or spirit but

2890
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,760
you don't pull this off on your own like

2891
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,119
the social context

2892
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,639
and so you create this kind of sub

2893
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,719
persona that you live into

2894
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,560
i believe they call it tulpa marco i

2895
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,080
think actually pointed me to this

2896
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,360
um but uh but you don't do it on your

2897
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,880
own you have a holding in hardness

2898
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,000
social context

2899
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,159
that supports your act and you're able

2900
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,440
to kind of collaboratively

2901
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,760
enacted and that seems to me to be agree

2902
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,560
this is

2903
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,080
we can you know empirically establish

2904
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,080
this as a mechanism personality change

2905
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,360
this seems to be part of what makes the

2906
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,840
magic happen so

2907
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,600
uh yeah that's the things i'm sort of

2908
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,119
thinking into like what are all of the

2909
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,639
levers we have

2910
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,199
to actually design our personalities

2911
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:42,320
going forward

2912
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:46,560
so you know what mental techniques uh

2913
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,040
psychedelics like meditation what what's

2914
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,239
at our disposal

2915
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,880
so that we can have like you know we can

2916
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,440
be

2917
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,320
good meta regulators over ourselves and

2918
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,719
like

2919
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,280
realizing like our deepest values thank

2920
01:38:59,280 --> 01:38:59,920
you

2921
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,400
adam i'm just gonna throw up that

2922
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,840
closing slide and then we'll

2923
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,520
hear from everybody who wants to raise

2924
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,880
their hand with the final

2925
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,520
note um this has really been an awesome

2926
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,000
active stream thirteen point one and 2.

2927
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,840
so in the calendar event for those who

2928
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,360
are participating live

2929
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,679
there's a feedback form a survey which

2930
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:19,280
would be really appreciated

2931
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,199
and all of you are always welcome

2932
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,040
whether you're the author or not

2933
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,080
to participate in a future active stream

2934
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,239
you can go to the spreadsheet and find

2935
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,360
out the calendar

2936
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,119
but all of you would be extremely

2937
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,280
welcome to be in a group active stream

2938
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,400
like this again

2939
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,320
and then if anybody has an idea for an

2940
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,840
event that they want to arrange or like

2941
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,639
an interview

2942
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,880
or a follow-up discussion or a few

2943
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,000
minutes isn't enough during this

2944
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,679
conversation to talk about drama

2945
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,840
or consciousness or whatever it happens

2946
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,760
to be let's just plan that as an event

2947
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,719
so that we can always

2948
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,719
make sure to hold the space for hearing

2949
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,159
about everyone's perspective because

2950
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,440
it's just such a great

2951
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,639
stew when we can have it all going so uh

2952
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,800
marco and then stephen and then anyone

2953
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,159
else who wants to raise their hand on a

2954
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:00,719
last

2955
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,000
uh note thank you

2956
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
i agree this has been very very

2957
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,600
enjoyable so thank you danny

2958
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,800
um yeah scott thank you for the nice um

2959
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,880
metaphorical pictures so i fully agree

2960
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,400
that there's this beautiful notion of

2961
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,840
the feelers right but

2962
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,560
but i think it's also interesting to um

2963
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,040
first

2964
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,560
distinguish reflexive feelers and

2965
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,320
intentional or expressive feelers right

2966
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,920
so how do you navigate

2967
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,040
uh to the world and in that challenge

2968
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,119
how do you navigate yourself and so i

2969
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,280
think personality or yourself model

2970
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,840
regarding you as a person are more of

2971
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,600
those reflexive theaters

2972
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,400
and then subsequently you are more able

2973
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,000
to grip or control or

2974
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,080
regulate the way you navigate the worlds

2975
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,760
with your perceptual feelers

2976
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,360
more specifically the the recognition

2977
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,440
models by which we are able to take in

2978
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,239
the worlds

2979
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,760
because they are what are being compared

2980
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,080
with the sense data um

2981
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,600
and you also said something very nice

2982
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,600
about i i really like

2983
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,080
carnot engines as a picture i actually

2984
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,840
love that you mentioned that

2985
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,400
um and you mentioned information

2986
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,600
differentials

2987
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,080
now information differentials uh is

2988
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,080
exactly what active inference is about

2989
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,400
right so so so the beauty is also

2990
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,360
there's a notion

2991
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,520
you mentioned entropy a lot but there's

2992
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,199
also a notion of relative entropy

2993
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,199
which is also known as the cool block

2994
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,199
library version which is exactly

2995
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,400
what underpins the entire formalism um

2996
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,639
because exactly like the carnot engine

2997
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:27,920
you want to minimize the temperature

2998
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,360
differential but in rain

2999
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,840
temperature is constant right similarly

3000
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,920
the energy consumption doesn't vary with

3001
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,400
more than order of magnitude and so the

3002
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,239
interesting interesting question here

3003
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,560
is okay to what extent is it like a

3004
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,440
carnot engine

3005
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,480
to what extent um does information

3006
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,560
just the minimization of information

3007
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,320
differentials play a part

3008
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,119
in this functional behavior so one very

3009
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,880
nice notion that i like which i got from

3010
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,040
a friend said burnett shout out

3011
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:58,320
um is coordinated equilibration

3012
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,760
so both in the case of normal

3013
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,920
conventional thermodynamic equilibration

3014
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,440
such as incarnate engines

3015
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,280
as well as in my opinion for active

3016
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,840
inference you're basically equilibrating

3017
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
the whole collection the complex

3018
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,320
covariance and co-conditional collection

3019
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,880
of information differentials and so no

3020
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,000
matter what's

3021
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,280
by virtue of it being physically

3022
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,600
instantiated it needs to equilibrate

3023
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,000
physically which has some relation with

3024
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,520
informational equilibration

3025
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,960
so in other words one thing i'd like to

3026
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,560
say is basically we're letting nature do

3027
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,280
the work

3028
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,600
right we're already nature it has to

3029
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:30,400
equilibrate

3030
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,719
and it happens that that finding of

3031
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:33,840
equilibria

3032
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,080
is in itself homologous or analogous

3033
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,560
to particular algorithmic instantiations

3034
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,719
which if you're interested is also

3035
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,719
interesting in computer science because

3036
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,000
apparently there's some nice

3037
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,280
works that connect um icing spin models

3038
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,239
at three models of magnets with a

3039
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,600
self-organized criticality

3040
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,239
right how the brain operates via

3041
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,159
avalanches or cascades of

3042
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,800
activity apparently these are formally

3043
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,719
implementable to solve basically

3044
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,280
most famous algorithmic challenges so i

3045
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,199
think hopefully you might find that

3046
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:11,440
interesting um right so

3047
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,960
yeah and so i'm not sure what your exact

3048
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,800
phrasing was but i want you to note that

3049
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,080
i think it's also a nice picture to

3050
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:19,280
imagine that what we're doing

3051
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,639
effectively

3052
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,000
oh yeah yeah you're talking about neg

3053
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,520
entropy so in fact what you're doing is

3054
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,159
basically

3055
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:28,080
you're you're partially deciding how

3056
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,520
you're going to be imprinted by the

3057
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,159
world

3058
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,320
right and that's the whole power of the

3059
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,760
whole predictive picture

3060
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,199
because the patterns that are out there

3061
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:37,199
in the world um are

3062
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,360
effectively the challenges themselves so

3063
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,360
when we internalize the patterns

3064
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,440
then we're more gripped or attuned to

3065
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,440
our or have a bigger affinity

3066
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,679
with the world so exactly right uh in

3067
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,480
that regard

3068
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,440
uh yeah sorry i forgot the rest of what

3069
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,159
you said

3070
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:53,920
um and regards for adam's beautiful

3071
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,239
point about spasticity of

3072
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:59,360
a personality um i also very much echoed

3073
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,000
this

3074
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,679
kind of criticism slash question of

3075
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,000
the whole assumption that personality

3076
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,360
traits

3077
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,639
is static right it's rigid but i think

3078
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:11,760
what he said earlier about course

3079
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,080
grading and what i called bootstrapping

3080
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,960
kind of maybe is a path to understand

3081
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:17,679
better how it

3082
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,920
shouldn't be seen as so static because

3083
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,040
if it indeed is

3084
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,199
a bootstrap in a time where it lacks

3085
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,800
self models and basically the

3086
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,960
accessibility of changing that initial

3087
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,239
bootstrapping model

3088
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:32,000
is uh is is inhibited or it's obstructed

3089
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,119
effectively right

3090
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,800
because if you want to reflexively act

3091
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,239
upon these models

3092
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,239
then you need to have a path towards

3093
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,280
these models

3094
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,639
so that you have to um act upon whatever

3095
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:44,239
influence your personality

3096
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:45,520
through layer and layer layer from

3097
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,480
superficial to deeper right um

3098
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,840
and that's a big challenge and i think

3099
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,760
indeed things like topaz things like

3100
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,440
visualization exercises

3101
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,840
are one example but i also really like

3102
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,119
siemens notes on

3103
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,600
drama and more situated experiments

3104
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,440
situated design

3105
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,960
where i think the notion of porosities

3106
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,719
was very interesting right to what

3107
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,199
extent do you allow the environment

3108
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:10,719
to influence you um and finally i just

3109
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:11,600
wanted to note

3110
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,080
that's because i mentioned it uh

3111
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,920
psychedelics yeah absolutely because the

3112
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:16,480
whole

3113
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,040
phrase is psychedelic the revealing of

3114
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,239
the mind

3115
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:21,920
but that's only one step the second step

3116
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,080
is reveal such that it becomes

3117
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,600
accessible to to systematic change um

3118
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,320
so yeah so so those are my thoughts and

3119
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,360
thank you for

3120
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,520
giving me these thoughts nice it's

3121
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,280
really great how you tied so many of

3122
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,480
those elements together

3123
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,800
so in the last couple of minutes just

3124
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,560
quickly from anyone who wants to speak

3125
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,360
we have stephen

3126
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,280
then scott then anyone else who raised

3127
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,719
than adam than anyone who raises their

3128
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,880
hand

3129
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,320
i mean this is what this paper is so

3130
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,159
interesting about is the way that it it

3131
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,040
gives these this dynamic mechanism

3132
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,159
which is good for active inference but

3133
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,520
it's also

3134
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,920
also quite an intuitive way to break

3135
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,159
down all these genetic models and

3136
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,600
and different things it gets hard when

3137
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,440
you start to layer different areas i

3138
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,960
suppose the two things that come up when

3139
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,239
i was thinking about

3140
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,639
the comments on the drama or acting is

3141
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:13,679
um

3142
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,520
is i think sometimes the acting or

3143
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,280
having a chance to go and do

3144
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:20,239
a performative event or action that's

3145
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,760
more like you're

3146
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,040
you're going on stage and

3147
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,719
that could be like that mounting car

3148
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,159
problem i don't know if you see

3149
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:30,239
if you see the paper of exploring a

3150
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,360
landscape

3151
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,119
um using your model and seeing different

3152
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,800
possibilities so it could extend

3153
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,440
out the possibilities and that mounting

3154
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,040
car that

3155
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,119
problem was quite good for looking at

3156
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,440
how that issue of expanding out

3157
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,400
can be important and then there's also

3158
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,840
and there's different ways that for

3159
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,920
instance method action is actually

3160
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,440
can be quite dangerous a lot of people

3161
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,800
have psychological issues if they go

3162
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,000
down that route

3163
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,239
um so the result there's a basically

3164
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:57,199
putting on an act

3165
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:59,440
is like you're still a performer and you

3166
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,440
know that you're in a sort of a field of

3167
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,000
practice

3168
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,600
presenting and being aware of where the

3169
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,920
audience is how close they are what size

3170
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:08,239
they

3171
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,840
of you they can see however

3172
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,920
just by doing that you will have that

3173
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,840
experience so you will have expended

3174
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,239
your

3175
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:19,119
expanded your range your entropy of

3176
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,760
possibilities or states of the world

3177
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,480
there's also participatory type drama

3178
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,000
where you could revisit

3179
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,840
a real life experience and go back into

3180
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,719
um through psychodrama social drama an

3181
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,639
actual experience that you had

3182
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:37,199
and look at that and then that also

3183
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,960
could give different ways to

3184
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,760
maybe understand your actual lived life

3185
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,600
now whether that would change

3186
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,239
the big five i don't know it may not be

3187
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:48,159
about changing the big five

3188
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,199
for someone it may be something else

3189
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,840
within that you know but it um so i

3190
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:54,560
think it's really

3191
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,560
there's a i just thought i'd add that to

3192
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,159
the great competition

3193
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,719
okay thank you scott and then adam then

3194
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,119
colin just in the last couple of minutes

3195
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,040
this is great very rich discussion i

3196
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,040
like the fact that we raised more things

3197
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,400
and this is really the beginning of a

3198
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,199
discussion

3199
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,239
than we resolved and that's beautiful um

3200
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,560
the tilpa really struck me because it's

3201
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,400
something where there's an imagination

3202
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,600
in an internal which is re valorized

3203
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,760
reified by the external in a

3204
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,239
in a process way and it really reminded

3205
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:24,960
me of law

3206
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,600
in law if you say you have a right but

3207
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,719
there is no duty

3208
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,800
of anyone else to respect that right

3209
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,159
like if i say i have a right to free

3210
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,000
speech a right to sit anywhere i want on

3211
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,719
the bus

3212
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,239
and no one else respects it i don't

3213
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,159
really just i just have words on paper i

3214
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,000
really need the duties and the rights

3215
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,760
and that dyad i think is really

3216
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,360
interesting that reification that

3217
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,719
valorization

3218
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,199
and it started to wonder whether it's it

3219
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,040
feels like something like behavioral

3220
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,960
catalysts or consciousness catalysts

3221
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,119
where you have that external and

3222
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,320
internal element

3223
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,080
are necessary for that coordinated

3224
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,480
equilibrium

3225
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,480
equilibration that as marco was alluding

3226
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,400
to so i'm fascinated by the discussion

3227
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,600
here i feel like there's we're just

3228
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,480
beginning

3229
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,000
and looking forward to other ways for us

3230
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,119
to continue because there's a lot of

3231
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,639
pieces that we still need to explore it

3232
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,880
feels like

3233
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,000
totally agreed uh so we'll have uh

3234
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
adam then colin and if anyone has

3235
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,920
thoughts on where we could explore next

3236
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,520
or what would be fun to explore they can

3237
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,920
mention it too adam then colin and a

3238
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,520
special thanks to both of you authors

3239
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,719
for coming for

3240
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,320
both of these conversations it was just

3241
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,840
it really made the whole thing come

3242
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,520
together so adam colin blue

3243
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,920
yeah i've been loving this thank you all

3244
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,960
of you

3245
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,080
um i'm really glad marco brought up

3246
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,280
criticality because

3247
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,520
it gives me an opportunity to hold forth

3248
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,560
for uh

3249
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,800
that's what colin knows is my religion

3250
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,000
um

3251
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,480
the and i think this someone harkens

3252
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,320
back to last week's discussion of um

3253
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,280
meditation and mindfulness um so one of

3254
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,719
the ways um

3255
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,719
i view mindfulness is a kind of like

3256
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:00,480
psychological manifestation of

3257
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,480
self-organized criticality

3258
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,560
so it's like there's this edge of chaos

3259
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,920
or this enter regime

3260
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,960
where you have enough uh variation

3261
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,159
enough disorder

3262
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:11,840
to give birth to a dancing star or

3263
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,080
rather to have variation for evolution

3264
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,199
to work with but then you have enough

3265
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,560
stability to get this cumulative

3266
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,480
evolution to have structure built upon

3267
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,520
structure

3268
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,920
and so on and so if it's the one regime

3269
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,080
where evolution is possible

3270
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,000
yeah this is a multi-scale phenomena

3271
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,840
this is probably this is a universality

3272
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,599
class like you'll find it everywhere

3273
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:31,520
at all scales and so at the

3274
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,960
psychological level

3275
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,000
um whatever you're really doing

3276
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,239
um in some sense i think it's going to

3277
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,199
be involved

3278
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,840
with respect to optimality and if one of

3279
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,119
the things you're doing is trying to

3280
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:43,679
like

3281
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,520
uh for instance uh try out something new

3282
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,639
um and like regulate like the amount of

3283
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:51,840
psychological entropy you're

3284
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,960
experiencing

3285
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,400
um this um basically setting up for

3286
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,639
yourself this return to this metastable

3287
01:50:58,639 --> 01:50:59,520
place

3288
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,040
where you can balance stability and

3289
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,639
plasticity where you can sort of

3290
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,560
ride along the edge of chaos and not

3291
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,000
fall in or

3292
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
or go too straight too far away from it

3293
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,280
um this is

3294
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,320
i think if you want to um either

3295
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,080
maintain your personality or change your

3296
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,199
personality

3297
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:18,320
or work within the bounds of it

3298
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,119
this seems to be really essential and uh

3299
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,159
i i

3300
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,520
this final thing is like i've been

3301
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,639
increasingly thinking like the way we

3302
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,000
think of mindfulness

3303
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,560
is like all wrong and that rather than

3304
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,080
thinking of it as like

3305
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,480
um this is a really nice state to be in

3306
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,599
and you're watching your breath and

3307
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:34,000
everything

3308
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,560
is like super great that's good but like

3309
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,639
more like the face space description

3310
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:41,520
and more as process and rather than like

3311
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,639
a thing you get

3312
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,760
it's a return to like a kind of

3313
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,320
a unnecessary home and really an

3314
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,040
essential part of cybernetic functioning

3315
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,880
of balancing stability and plasticity

3316
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,840
that you're going to need for anything

3317
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,280
thanks so much adam colin then blue

3318
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,119
i'm glad this whole idea of the edge of

3319
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,360
chaos came up because

3320
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,280
adam earlier you said at some point you

3321
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,719
know we're talking about active

3322
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:07,440
inference so

3323
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,360
talking about free energy and we and we

3324
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,800
don't like surprise

3325
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,320
and of course as soon as i hear that you

3326
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,679
know what i think well no we do like

3327
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:14,719
surprise

3328
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,520
um uh we seek out surprise often we like

3329
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,880
surprises right we like

3330
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,040
uncertainty we like uh we like risk

3331
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,320
people enjoy these things that's

3332
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,679
exploration

3333
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,639
and so and the reason that we have both

3334
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:27,679
it's

3335
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:29,199
one i think maybe the most important

3336
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,040
fact in psychology that we have an

3337
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,159
innate

3338
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:35,119
ambivalent response to uncertainty and

3339
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:36,719
an increase in entropy which is

3340
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,639
simultaneously positive and negative

3341
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:39,440
right we

3342
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,480
obviously don't like surprise we fear

3343
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,520
entropy we need things to be predictable

3344
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,599
or everything disintegrates

3345
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,040
but at the same time we like surprise we

3346
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,119
like uncertainty we like exploration and

3347
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,199
if we don't do that then we don't adapt

3348
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:57,840
and eventually we get too rigid and

3349
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,440
everything disintegrates right so

3350
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,440
you have to seek out entropy in order to

3351
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,159
avoid eventual catastrophic increases in

3352
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,599
entropy right you have to seek it out

3353
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:06,960
and master it

3354
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,360
um and so that's why you need to be at

3355
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,159
that

3356
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:13,520
line between order and and chaos right

3357
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,480
between order and

3358
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,960
and disorder and you know as adam's

3359
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,320
pointing out that's what

3360
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:21,119
uh that's what evolved systems evolve

3361
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:22,239
towards is toward the

3362
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:24,000
edge of chaos because that maximizes the

3363
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
possibility for computation it maximizes

3364
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,199
the possibility for adaptation um

3365
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:32,400
and there is

3366
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,040
to make a segway from the abstract to

3367
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,400
the more

3368
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
creep because i feel like that's sort of

3369
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,520
like what

3370
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,280
my collaboration with adam it's like i'm

3371
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,280
tying this to more concrete

3372
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,119
psycho psychology he's trying to more

3373
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,440
abstract theory

3374
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,280
there's a lot of work in the last 20

3375
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,119
years in personality psychology on

3376
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,639
personality change and especially

3377
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,800
personality trait change

3378
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,840
one of the things we know from this

3379
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,679
research is that virtually everyone has

3380
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,280
at least one personality trait that they

3381
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,119
would like to change

3382
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,920
we also know that personality traits can

3383
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:04,320
and do

3384
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,639
change over time it might not always be

3385
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,159
easy to change traits they might not

3386
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:09,280
always change

3387
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,679
you know dramatically but we do see

3388
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:13,280
change in personality traits over time

3389
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,719
we know that things like therapeutic

3390
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,560
interventions change personality traits

3391
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,760
especially reducing

3392
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:20,800
neuroticism and personality

3393
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,639
psychologists have recently been trying

3394
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:23,920
to develop

3395
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,080
uh systematic programmatic interventions

3396
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,199
to help people to change

3397
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:29,199
different personality traits and of

3398
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:30,639
course a lot of it is through

3399
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,800
first just changing more specific habits

3400
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,719
more specific characteristic adaptations

3401
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:36,000
because that's what as adam said you

3402
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:36,719
have more

3403
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,840
of an immediate grasp on is how to uh

3404
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,360
how to change your habits how to change

3405
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,280
your particular strategies

3406
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,960
but it is possible for those to

3407
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,639
generalize to these more

3408
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,560
uh general changes and i would think of

3409
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,960
that as you know you you learn specific

3410
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,400
things but eventually those things that

3411
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,000
you learn may actually tweak some of the

3412
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,599
underlying general parameters that

3413
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,599
actually enact those specific things

3414
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,760
over time

3415
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,239
thank you colin for those who need to

3416
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:03,199
drop off

3417
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:05,119
thanks for coming just to respect the

3418
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:06,880
end of the official event but

3419
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,880
blue dave and then we'll chill for a

3420
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,719
couple more minutes but thanks everyone

3421
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:11,520
so much for

3422
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,159
coming today

3423
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:17,360
um so i want to thank the authors

3424
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,119
especially for for being here and

3425
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:21,199
livening up this conversation but just

3426
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,280
as far as things that i think we could

3427
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,960
continue talking about or that would be

3428
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,400
interesting to pursue

3429
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,960
in the active inference framework um are

3430
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,639
things like personality change or things

3431
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:32,639
that do change the personality right

3432
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,679
like trauma therapy psychedelics

3433
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,599
mindfulness meditation like all of these

3434
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,440
things can really have drastic effects

3435
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,280
on who a person is

3436
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,239
um fundamentally i i expect in like

3437
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,000
terms of big five as well

3438
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,400
and then also like maybe in a non-active

3439
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,080
inference kind of way like the

3440
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,360
discussion on consciousness

3441
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,320
is is big and heavy and uh maybe not for

3442
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,599
this live stream but

3443
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,119
something that is definitely always

3444
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:00,320
worth um talking about

3445
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,599
thank you blue dave yeah

3446
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:07,119
um sean carroll interviewed carl frist

3447
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:08,480
in a few months ago

3448
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:11,280
and he brought up i think the same point

3449
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:11,840
that

3450
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,880
professor de young just mentioned wait a

3451
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,520
minute

3452
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,599
we don't try to be certain about

3453
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,000
everything we want novelty we want

3454
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,440
we want to be confused and professor

3455
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,239
christian became

3456
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:27,520
even slower and more methodical and

3457
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,560
self-critical and self-qualifying

3458
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,280
than usual and really went i think was

3459
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,920
working through all these levels of

3460
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,320
mathematization

3461
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,239
that i'm sorry in my humble opinion he's

3462
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,320
kind of gotten trapped into

3463
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,199
that's something that professor edelman

3464
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,159
was terrified

3465
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,560
as this incredibly brilliant young kid

3466
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,159
and he's gonna get his brain

3467
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:52,239
sucked by the algebra

3468
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:55,040
thank you dave um you know it reminds me

3469
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,400
it's controlled novelty

3470
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,800
we can't just say more it's more as

3471
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,560
different as what we say in complexity

3472
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:00,960
and

3473
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,280
when it comes to cybernetic goal-driven

3474
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,880
edu chaos systems

3475
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,199
it's not so simple as just take a linear

3476
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:08,480
aggression and you know

3477
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,639
more ants is better for the colony no i

3478
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,000
mean selection has

3479
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
clearly in different niches resulted in

3480
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,119
colonies that have different

3481
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:18,719
shapes of everything so it's a local

3482
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:21,440
vector of selection but then the broader

3483
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,719
space is actually not

3484
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,880
quite so linear so i hear you on that

3485
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,800
marco

3486
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,400
yeah thanks i'm glad you mentioned that

3487
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,400
podcast actually uh in my opinion

3488
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,480
the best conversation with carl because

3489
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,080
sean being also

3490
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,920
professor carol also being a physicist

3491
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,520
he really was able to

3492
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,920
get carl um active and and it's more

3493
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,599
playful and cheerful about talking about

3494
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:42,560
it but i'm not sure

3495
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,560
what you mean with the with the getting

3496
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,000
more required and stuff critical i think

3497
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:46,719
it's more

3498
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:49,599
is awareness that that's really the the

3499
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,360
main challenge in dealing with these

3500
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,639
kind of seeming

3501
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:55,440
tensions or or paradoxes because i do

3502
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,280
think there's a very important

3503
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,960
intention to point out when it comes to

3504
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,480
formal modeling especially

3505
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,480
when it comes to formally modeling

3506
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,080
brains or humans

3507
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:06,880
as we are all also familiar with um

3508
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,920
which concerns

3509
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,239
um as seen for example in the

3510
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:11,520
personality model

3511
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,800
and there are often these

3512
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,040
complementarities these trade-offs

3513
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,679
um and often in infor psychology in

3514
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:18,400
normal

3515
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:21,280
communication we tend to pick a trade or

3516
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,560
pick a characteristic and just say

3517
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,440
that's good or bad

3518
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:26,560
it's always decontextualized it's rarely

3519
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,480
in relation to the trade-offs

3520
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,880
um in relation to which they obtain an

3521
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,320
actual normative value

3522
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:36,239
or valid normally value might be um

3523
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:39,679
and crap something else oh yeah so um i

3524
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:40,560
link to the youtube

3525
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,040
on the youtube chat but but i really

3526
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,119
personally am very fond of the theme of

3527
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,960
pleasant surprises pleasant

3528
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,400
perturbations

3529
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,440
um and this controls

3530
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,840
on these controlled unknowns for example

3531
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,760
um well steven's gone now but but he

3532
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:56,960
mentioned the idea of space

3533
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,800
right so we could imagine um well first

3534
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,599
should be more formal so formally um

3535
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:04,320
that's

3536
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,679
already resolved in 2017 um a paper i

3537
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:09,360
was happy to be the co-author on

3538
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,400
um because if active influence doesn't

3539
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,480
concern itself with free energy per se

3540
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,400
it's expected free energy right and the

3541
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,920
more sophisticated your models

3542
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,679
the more sophisticated your temporal

3543
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,560
death and your contrafactual imagination

3544
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,719
uh imagination is very formal but i but

3545
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:25,840
i like

3546
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,080
allowing us to talk about imagination as

3547
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,040
if it was formal

3548
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,719
right kind of liberating it's from

3549
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:32,320
psychological connotations

3550
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,960
and way too many centuries of philosophy

3551
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,080
kind of dunking on it

3552
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,599
right because it's simply because you

3553
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:39,679
didn't have the grounding so

3554
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,920
so it takes exactly an active influence

3555
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,960
that these tensions

3556
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,599
disappear if we allow ourselves to to to

3557
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:46,400
accept

3558
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,000
uh what the mathematics actually say but

3559
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,840
there is this kind of trade-off but

3560
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,360
there is this kind of complementarity

3561
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,440
that indeed it is kind of the hidden

3562
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:56,400
notion of yin and yang um and so it's no

3563
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,480
surprise that stability and plasticity

3564
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,639
is the meta trade in my opinion

3565
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:02,560
um and oh yeah sorry and i linked uh

3566
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,159
that paper from heinleich

3567
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:05,920
who is uh at the for university of

3568
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,599
brussels and a pretty prominent research

3569
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:08,639
ceremony

3570
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,639
and he has a very interesting notion

3571
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,960
which quite like about um

3572
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,000
challenge propagation so um that's

3573
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,199
continuing the theme of pleasant

3574
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:19,280
surprises because

3575
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,679
we design challenges for each other

3576
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,119
social situations

3577
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:26,480
games work all these cultural niches

3578
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,400
our designs challenge is simply by

3579
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,239
virtue of the fact that

3580
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,159
they were selected by our social

3581
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:34,320
cultural dynamics we allowed these to

3582
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:34,880
persist

3583
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,199
throughout time in culture knowing that

3584
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:38,480
in their persistence they

3585
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,800
enact positive effects on us as we try

3586
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,000
to adapt to them

3587
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,080
right and so i in that sense i find it

3588
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,280
very very beautiful

3589
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,800
um that these kind of controlled

3590
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,639
unknowns is controlled chaos

3591
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:50,719
is such a common theme in how we design

3592
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,880
each other and allow each other to

3593
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:55,760
cultivate and in that sense to another

3594
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,320
theme

3595
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,719
we co-regulate each other and in that

3596
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:00,719
co-regulation of each other

3597
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:02,400
we develop these kind of super personal

3598
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,719
personalities which i think

3599
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,239
well hopefully people can agree that we

3600
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,080
sometimes really feel that viscerally

3601
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,800
the kind of personality or vibe as as

3602
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,679
millionaires

3603
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:13,920
us like to say and there's some certain

3604
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,280
vibes in aries

3605
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,119
wow and these vibes tend to resonate

3606
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:18,480
with our personalities

3607
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,599
because we already have these models of

3608
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:23,520
this kind of strategies and goals and

3609
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,639
values we

3610
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,280
we instantiate for particular situations

3611
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,719
and so it's not far-fetched that the

3612
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:29,840
same models

3613
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,080
afford us also send certain

3614
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,199
personality-like

3615
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:36,239
themes in situations because that is

3616
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:37,119
literally

3617
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,800
the kind of brain system we use we use

3618
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,280
the brain system of persons

3619
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:44,080
to do this right the the brain system

3620
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:44,719
somewhere

3621
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,960
frontal there's a lot of performance

3622
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:47,840
area

3623
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,480
um we have next to each other a brainery

3624
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,760
activated when we

3625
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,000
do self-modeling and next to that

3626
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,679
modeling other people

3627
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:57,679
and so that is also exhibited in how

3628
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:00,000
easily we attribute personality

3629
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,159
or intention to inanimate super

3630
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,679
simplified objects

3631
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:06,080
right and that speaks to in my opinion

3632
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,080
the validity of the core assumptions in

3633
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:08,400
this

3634
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,320
paper uh that personality can be

3635
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,840
decomposed and indeed that's been

3636
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,639
perfected of values strategies and goals

3637
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:17,119
um sorry i went on a ramble i thought i

3638
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:18,000
was going to say but but

3639
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,040
yeah our relational architecture

3640
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,320
the way that we talk about organic

3641
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,639
chemistry and this chlorine wants to do

3642
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:26,080
that and this galaxy

3643
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,679
exactly that the intention the

3644
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:29,119
intentional stance

3645
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:31,280
that relational thinking is so deep and

3646
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,480
the way that you put it with a super

3647
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,679
personality it's like

3648
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:37,119
the superman is the collective leviathan

3649
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:38,480
it's not just the better

3650
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,760
individual nest mate it's that and

3651
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,360
in the context of something that's

3652
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,800
actually super

3653
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,920
or supra like above not just better

3654
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,000
um scott and then anyone else who wants

3655
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,520
to make a final comment but this has

3656
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,080
been really

3657
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,719
great marco this is i mean that was so

3658
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:55,199
beautiful

3659
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:56,560
he's starting to think of the

3660
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,040
choreography of consciousness

3661
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,159
you know that's what it felt like you

3662
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:02,480
know it's such a beautiful notion

3663
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,159
i always used to tell my kids now

3664
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:06,000
they're in the 20s i used to say the

3665
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
only time you see reality is when you

3666
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,920
see paradox

3667
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,280
and any other time you're inside a model

3668
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,599
and the paradox and that goes right the

3669
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:16,800
paradox is

3670
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,880
the reality that's the reality of our

3671
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,560
interaction you know you're interacting

3672
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,119
then

3673
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:23,119
you know you know you're in encountering

3674
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:24,159
something

3675
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:27,199
and so that notion of embracing the

3676
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,159
paradoxical

3677
02:03:28,159 --> 02:03:30,800
and the dance and the and the

3678
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,880
negotiation of it it reminds me the last

3679
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,320
point i was going to make is it reminds

3680
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,320
me of the research they did on fish

3681
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,119
swimming they took a semi-rigid piece of

3682
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,840
plastic and they put it in a

3683
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,199
stream and they started increasing the

3684
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,360
speed of the stream and at a certain

3685
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,599
speed of the stream the plastic

3686
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:50,320
undulated with a periodicity that was

3687
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,199
akin to how fish swim and they realize

3688
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,199
that fish don't swim through water they

3689
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,599
pass through the water

3690
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:00,480
and because they the water is causing

3691
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:01,280
them

3692
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:05,360
their swim similarly that choreography

3693
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,880
of consciousness

3694
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,280
is that right we're not we don't just

3695
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,400
situate our

3696
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,679
cognition we situate our persona and our

3697
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:16,159
and and it's constructed externally and

3698
02:04:16,159 --> 02:04:16,960
internally

3699
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,840
so the last thing i wondered about is is

3700
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,639
each system gdelian

3701
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:24,719
so each system is incomplete has

3702
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,159
questions within it that can't be

3703
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:27,760
answered from within it

3704
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:30,000
and maybe our novelty seeking is an

3705
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,079
intrinsic recognition that we're all

3706
02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:34,239
gdelians

3707
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:36,320
that we need to go outside to find

3708
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,440
answers

3709
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,920
so anyway great discussion love it thank

3710
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:40,480
you guys

3711
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,679
thanks as always coming on

3712
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:47,280
scott um so uh let's just go from uh

3713
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,239
dave colin marco and then we'll probably

3714
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:51,360
call it unless someone else has a

3715
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,199
burning desire

3716
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:55,760
the only time we need to be conscious is

3717
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,000
where we're in that zone of paradox

3718
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
we ought to understand it and we don't

3719
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:06,560
nice colin well on the same theme

3720
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,320
i really like that idea of paradox being

3721
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,920
reality too and that's the same

3722
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,199
as the prima materia of the alchemists

3723
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:16,960
right it's what is the thing behind

3724
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:17,679
everything

3725
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,280
that gives birth to those things and

3726
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,119
it's precisely the thing that we don't

3727
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:22,400
understand

3728
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,480
it's the thing that's unknown right and

3729
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,719
so that's the chaos that's on the you

3730
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:28,079
know the other side of

3731
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:29,440
the border where we're at the edge of

3732
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:32,159
chaos uh and yeah from

3733
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:33,440
especially from the perspective of

3734
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,040
consciousness what you need to be

3735
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,800
conscious of is precisely only those

3736
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,679
things that you

3737
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:42,320
don't understand perfectly already

3738
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,000
marco

3739
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,920
yeah um uh yeah scott thank you that was

3740
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:50,560
beautiful

3741
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,960
um uh yeah i just wanted to riff on that

3742
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:53,599
so so

3743
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:56,800
i i laughed because um i mean i feel

3744
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,800
comfortable saying this here so so

3745
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,079
you know me and my friends we were

3746
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:02,000
interested in psychedelics so

3747
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,159
so i find it very very fascinating that

3748
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:05,679
there's a huge variety

3749
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:08,719
in what i call idiosyncratic encounters

3750
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:10,159
so a lot of my friends with the

3751
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:11,760
psychedelics have this one thing that

3752
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,040
they feel like oh wow that was so

3753
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,079
fundamental

3754
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:15,760
and one of my friends uh let's call her

3755
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,520
luta um

3756
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:20,000
she had exactly that right she said i

3757
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
couldn't escape the idea that everything

3758
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,960
is parallax

3759
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,639
right and uh though i won't go into it

3760
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,639
but every other such quintessential

3761
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:27,520
encounter

3762
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,599
it is a great culture also in my opinion

3763
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,280
relates to something

3764
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,000
formalizable in terms of active

3765
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,960
inference

3766
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,119
um and i really really like the notion

3767
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,800
of choreography of dance i i use the

3768
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,079
metaphor a lot too

3769
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,239
the um you might also be interested in

3770
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:43,360
fridge of kaplan's

3771
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,520
who also wrote the tao of physics and he

3772
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:47,280
also had this moment

3773
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,679
of insight about physics simply being

3774
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:50,320
this uh

3775
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:53,280
dance right he used a metaphor of god a

3776
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,639
deity in hinduism

3777
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:57,119
but more formally and interestingly well

3778
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:58,159
my attempt to form

3779
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:00,400
formally make it interesting is as we

3780
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,280
noted right

3781
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,760
cybernetics acts upon configurations of

3782
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,320
models

3783
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:07,040
simply because systems are composite or

3784
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:08,000
compositional

3785
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,360
and distributed and constantly

3786
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:11,440
reorganizing so the very least can say

3787
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,119
that it's about configurations

3788
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:16,000
yes um going back to an earlier thread

3789
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,320
if

3790
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,320
conscious indeed is intermediating

3791
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,239
cybernetics then they need to

3792
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:22,480
intermediate the balancing or the

3793
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,960
meta configuration of configuration

3794
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,159
which themselves

3795
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:28,560
are constantly changing so exactly in in

3796
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,159
the example you took with the fish

3797
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:32,719
they are embedded or immersed in fluid

3798
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:33,520
dynamics

3799
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,280
right there are flows and i say that

3800
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,440
formally these are informational flows

3801
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,599
so they're immersed in all these flows

3802
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:41,040
and they need to find

3803
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,239
or the space needs to find uh the space

3804
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:45,440
need to situate itself

3805
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:47,840
in between those flows and by virtue of

3806
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:48,880
doing that

3807
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:51,280
it is regulating them right and so i

3808
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,960
think that's a very beautiful idea

3809
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,800
um and the last thing i think is also

3810
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,400
very beautiful so um we're all good

3811
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:56,719
earlier

3812
02:07:56,719 --> 02:07:58,800
we're all in completes uh which reminds

3813
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,320
me of conversations i've had with a

3814
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:03,040
simon de deo a research at sfi institute

3815
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,480
very very good researcher very

3816
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,880
interesting has some very very nice work

3817
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:07,440
on

3818
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:10,320
bayesianism and the nature of knowledge

3819
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:10,800
um

3820
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,920
and and um i i think i said to him

3821
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:15,280
exactly what you said right they saw

3822
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:17,199
kadalian but but how i phrase it is

3823
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:19,599
we're all each other's oracles so an

3824
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:20,480
oracle and

3825
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,840
you know in computer science but they

3826
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,800
give you an answer that you can't

3827
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,079
actually compute but if you would have

3828
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:26,239
the answer then things would come easier

3829
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:29,440
so it is by virtue of the noise we are

3830
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,199
incomplete and that is allowed

3831
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:32,800
because other people's incomplete

3832
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,119
systems can act as an oracle for us

3833
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:36,560
and so i think that's also something

3834
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,880
that speaks to our experience of how

3835
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,679
we aware certain things but we're it's

3836
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:42,480
in in fact

3837
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,079
actually very complete but we trust that

3838
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:45,520
it's okay to be complete

3839
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:47,520
and if interested in that then uh i'm

3840
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:50,639
sure you know hofstadter goddess

3841
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,320
terence deacon in complete nature as

3842
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,760
adam mentioned

3843
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,920
and the day as i mentioned so yeah

3844
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,360
thanks so much that was very simulating

3845
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,599
