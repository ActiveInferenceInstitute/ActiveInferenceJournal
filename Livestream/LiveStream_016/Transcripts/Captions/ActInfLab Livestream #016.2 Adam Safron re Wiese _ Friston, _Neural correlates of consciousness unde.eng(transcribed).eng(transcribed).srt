00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
hello and welcome to the active

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,480
inference live stream today is active

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
inference live stream 16.2

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,199
on february 23rd 2021.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
welcome to the active inference lab

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,680
everyone we're a participatory online

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
lab that is communicating learning and

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
practicing applied active inference you

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
can find us on our website twitter email

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,439
youtube

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
discord key based teams

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
this is recorded and an archived live

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,520
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
feedback so that we can be improving on

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
our work

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
welcome and as far as the netiquette the

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
video etiquette for the live streams

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,680
we'll be muting raising our hand writing

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
down our points using respectful speech

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
behavior

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
today in 16.2 at the end of february

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,920
we are having a follow-up discussion on

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
the paper of wanja visa and carl fristen

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
neural correlates of consciousness and

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
last week we were really um it was

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
really special to have laundry come on

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
the stream and quite interesting stuff

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
and next week we're going to be having

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,840
our first ever quarterly round table

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,159
which will be providing some updates on

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
the different projects of the active

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
inference lab

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,240
also as far as upcoming streams and

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,200
events

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
we have a new i guess uh series called

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
the guest stream so this is the live

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
stream which is the participatory group

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
discussion we have the model stream

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,439
which is the walkthrough or a tutorial

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
of a more technical piece and then the

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
guest stream is going to be kind of like

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
anything goes just anytime somebody has

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
a new paper out

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,640
or they want to be raising some topic to

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
visibility we want to be there for them

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
and help them on that so tomorrow we're

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
going to be having majeed benny speak on

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
his recent paper a critical analysis of

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
markovian monism and then in march and

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,159
in may we'll have guest visits from

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,200
demetrius bolas and anna siaunica

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
and if you have a suggestion for any of

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
these other events

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
or you want to be featured on an event

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
or you'd like to co-organize an event

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,520
with us then all you have to do is let

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
us know and we go from there

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
today in active stream 16.2 the goal is

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
to learn discuss and hear from everybody

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,680
and just knowing dave and adam i think

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
will be able to have a really awesome

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,840
discussion where we are going to bring

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
up a lot of fun ideas centering and

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
strangely attracting back to this paper

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,480
the neural correlates to consciousness

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
under the free energy principle from

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
computational correlates to

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
computational explanation from visa and

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
firstin in 2020.

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
so today uh with a small group and a

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
follow-up discussion

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
there's a bunch of slides from last time

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
that we can definitely go to there's

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
also the paper itself but let's just

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
start with um an introduction so

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
we're gonna go around and introduce

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
ourself and again seeing as um just dave

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
adam and i are here we can each

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
introduce ourselves and maybe provide a

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,519
little context on some of these warm-up

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,159
questions so whichever of you two would

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,200
like to

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
go first um

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
we can still utilize hand raising or

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,319
perhaps it'll be a little easier um

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
to just have it like a regular

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
tripartite conversation so we'll go with

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
dave and then adam on the introduction

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
and on the context thanks

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
okay i'm gathering up

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,760
some reference material from a number of

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,879
different

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,200
ontologies

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
in order to get those aligned with the

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
topics for the edu project

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,040
i'm also going through a great big brain

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
dump from

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,920
the

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,959
most noted neuro psychoanalyst in south

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
africa who has give gotten two papers

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,000
and a book out just in the last two

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
weeks and i'm struggling through those

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
he has rewritten

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,840
the

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,239
project for a scientific psychology by

107
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
sigmund freud from 1895

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
in absolutely state-of-the-art

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
carl fristen

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,399
uh terminology the only thing he doesn't

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
hammer on a lot is specifically active

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
inference but all the other cool stuff

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,840
and it's just a brain breaker who is

114
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,000
this

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,720
thanks for the update um so we'll post

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
any links and we'll try to like keep it

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
on the discussion that people are here

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
to be listening about so if you have any

119
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
other thoughts dave otherwise adam go

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
for it

121
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
um

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
hi

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
uh

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
so i guess up uh

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
i'm adam uh

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
like an introduction or just what i'm

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,639
working on or just

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
how um say you know say hello we can

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
just ask how did we come to be here how

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
did we follow fall into a follow-up

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
discussion on a computational

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
consciousness paper

133
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
okay so um

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
i guess i have been

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
uh working for some time to try to

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,199
understand

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,080
uh

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
what the heck consciousness

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,520
is uh if that question even makes sense

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
uh

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,759
from different perspectives where the

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,039
free energy principle and active

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,240
inference um

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
has in general been i guess the

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,039
overarching view from which i'm

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
attempting to think

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
and so i've been

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
following what different people are

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,240
saying

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
proposing some ideas of my own um

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
and uh

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
just uh

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
along these lines of learning about

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
active inference i found like the live

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,080
streams and what daniel's doing and the

156
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
um

157
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
the discussions slash uh

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
potential movements that he's creating

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,440
and

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
um this is just one of the most uh

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
interesting conversations around as far

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,280
as i'm concerned

163
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
thanks adam

164
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
also dave i have a question i know you

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
have a lot of background in

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,919
classical cybernetics if it could be

167
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,720
called that so how does cybernetics deal

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
with this question of consciousness or

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
what have been some of the long-running

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
threads as far as the way cyberneticians

171
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
pre-active inference have been thinking

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,039
about this question

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
well

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
there's uh gregory bateson did a lot of

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
work on this in the 40s through the 60s

176
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,960
um

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,479
working as a therapist and as an uh arc

178
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,280
anthropologist

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
he

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
paid a lot of attention to

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,800
how people get fouled up

182
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
um he uses the term schizogenesis that

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
is the the origins of splits

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
sometimes it's a sort of a good thing

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
it's a way that a society can become

186
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
more differentiated

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,599
but in a child it's a great danger the

188
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
child for instance the uh

189
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,479
the thesis which turns out not to be all

190
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
that useful is that um

191
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,759
small children are constantly

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
misunderstanding what their parents are

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
saying the parents are not addressing

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
them very effectively they're assuming

195
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,960
the kids

196
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
either have less in intense in emotions

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,039
than they do

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
or that the kids understand more about

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
the shared the world of shared reality

200
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
so the kid will get flustered uh

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
demoralized alienated and in the best

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
case there's a reconciliation and the

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,080
the mother typically and the baby will

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
get back in sync they're now happy with

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
one another uh but sometimes the split

206
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
gets worse and worse and those same

207
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,680
combination of rage and demoralization

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
plays out into adulthood and

209
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
too often

210
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,639
as parents

211
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,039
uh and bateson uses draws a lot on great

212
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,680
on bertrand russell's theory of types

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
so he does he analyzes society's

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
interactions roles

215
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
with a very elaborate treatment of

216
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
hierarchies of meaning hierarchies of

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
reference hierarchies of control

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,879
and communication

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
uh so it loops right back to the old

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
definition of

221
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
the study of communication and control

222
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,440
and now my teacher gordon pasque put a

223
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,240
great deal of emphasis on two areas that

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,640
i i don't see addressed

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
adequately today

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
on the one hand

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
uh the inevitability of dialogue or

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
conversation in any

229
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
conscious occasion he says there's no

230
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
consciousness without dialogue

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
second point there's no consciousness in

232
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,399
fact no cons no concept without emotion

233
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
and third there's no persistent concept

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
without circular causation

235
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
and we know how important circular

236
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,600
causation is in explaining

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
how the mark of the the

238
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
markov bounded system and its

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
environment co-create

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
and stuart kaufman does a lot of

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,880
discussion of co-creation between the

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
niche

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
and the worker that is the organism the

244
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
society

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,959
the person the evolving language culture

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
whatever it might be

247
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,880
so it's not that these concepts are

248
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
completely missing but they're not as

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,560
articulated as they were even in the

250
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,040
1970s when pasc was developing the first

251
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
really effective

252
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,399
teaching learning

253
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
systems

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
with tiny clunky computers that were

255
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
half

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
made up of cards that people the the the

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
students had to be prompted to pick up a

258
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,959
cardboard card and put it on the display

259
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,519
because there was no way to display text

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,839
other than what you had to like little

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
lights and that would be labeled a1

262
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,519
which means go grab card a1 and read it

263
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
cool it's like we're better off now in

264
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
some ways sounds like playing battleship

265
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,560
with your computer um but

266
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
what you said there about the multiple

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
like perspectives in pursuing this

268
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
consciousness question there's the

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
anthropologist studying humans there's

270
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
the therapists who might be interested

271
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,519
in social systems more generally but

272
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
they're in a very specific relationship

273
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
and they might not be trying to do a

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
full ethnography or an anthropology

275
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
research project the therapist

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
relationship is one that's based upon

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
it's it's more medical it's based upon

278
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
helping reduce someone's suffering and

279
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
then even zooming out further and

280
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,680
further away from the experience there's

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
the biologist who might compare human

282
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,200
society or behavior with other animals

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
and then even a systems researcher that

284
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
might even go beyond the biological and

285
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
ask about where computers fit into all

286
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
this and so it's like in the center we

287
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
have our own experience and the

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
experience of other people and that is

289
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
what is negotiated

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
in that uh sort of kernel of the therapy

291
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
relationship or in the dialogue if it's

292
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,040
not which can be therapeutic even if

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
someone's uh not licensed but then we're

294
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
like going in these concentric shells

295
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
out

296
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
towards broader

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
systems thinking so i think that is what

298
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,760
i liked and remembered about the paper

299
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
and one of the things that motivates me

300
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,560
to

301
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
think about it go down different rabbit

302
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
holes and hear from people's

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,320
perspectives on it because there isn't a

304
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
priori a best approach and even within

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
an approach or one of those concentric

306
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,959
spheres it's not like there's one way to

307
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,279
do biology or one way to do anthropology

308
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
one way to do therapy so

309
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,000
how are we going to make adequate

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,560
guidance and navigation for the bigger

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,519
system

312
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,560
when

313
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,959
if we just get lost in all the possible

314
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
ways it could go then we are going to be

315
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
doing a lot of moving words around but

316
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
maybe not a lot of useful actions so

317
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
looking forward to hearing about that

318
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,680
and then also what you said about the

319
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,839
different developmental phases having

320
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
different cybernetic or communication

321
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,040
needs

322
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,600
so cybernetic principles like

323
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
having requisite variety or good

324
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,959
regulator whether we want to use the

325
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,760
classical cybernetic terminology or just

326
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
thinking about communicating systems

327
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,480
different developmental stages are able

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,399
to deal with different stresses and are

329
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
able to achieve different goals and so

330
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,760
there might be some things that are

331
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,240
overwhelming for a child but then maybe

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
later on we hope that that information

333
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
could be integrated or virtualized or

334
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
emulated or somehow

335
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
used in a controllable way

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
um any other just

337
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,279
off the top of the head thoughts because

338
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
i think we'll actually have a lot of

339
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
great

340
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
discussions stemming from just walking

341
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
through some of these slides is that

342
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,639
cool

343
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,240
all right nice

344
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,120
so just to recap maybe those who have

345
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
listened to the zero and one

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
conversations or not

347
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,440
but the paper that we're following up on

348
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
today is called the neural correlates of

349
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
consciousness under the free energy

350
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,320
principle from computational close to

351
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
computational explanation

352
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
and the

353
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
aims and the claims of the paper were to

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
integrate the neural correlates of

355
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
consciousness

356
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
with the computational correlates of

357
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,160
consciousness

358
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,040
and

359
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
implicitly also the behavioral

360
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
correlates of consciousness bcc if we

361
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
could use that and then think about how

362
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
free energy principle and active

363
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,199
inference are going to be integrating

364
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,160
these

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
we went through the abstract

366
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
and uh the roadmap

367
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
last time

368
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
so today we're gonna just start off

369
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,760
by

370
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
uh looking at some of the questions that

371
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
people had raised in 16.1 which

372
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
we've now separated out into different

373
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,800
slides and added cc images in the

374
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,839
background so if anyone in the live chat

375
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
is just wanting to post a question or

376
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
something comes to mind we're definitely

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,160
open otherwise we'll just slowly march

378
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
through these fun slides and then

379
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,399
hopefully get to look at some of the

380
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
paper as well

381
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,160
so the first question and the one that

382
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
blue sort of brought back to the table

383
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
in 16.1 and

384
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
helped integrate into the construction

385
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,279
of 16.0 is how do we define and measure

386
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,160
consciousness so it's related to what is

387
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,519
consciousness

388
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,440
but we're almost approaching it

389
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
instrumentally instead of what is it

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
um which is the realism question we're

391
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
going to take the instrumentalist

392
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
approach how do we operationally define

393
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,959
it and how do we measure it or what are

394
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
we measuring because if you're

395
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
discussing what something is or isn't

396
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,639
without the instruments in mind how

397
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
you're actually going to be measuring it

398
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,800
or observing it

399
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,680
what is it going to be there for

400
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
so we had a few different terms that

401
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,399
people brought up

402
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,279
but

403
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
either of you would be welcome to give a

404
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
thought or adam might be curious just

405
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
from yeah you can speaking i'll ask you

406
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
a question too is in your

407
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,279
approach to studying consciousness what

408
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
measurements do you think are the most

409
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
important whether they're data sets we

410
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
already have or whether it's a kind of

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
data that doesn't quite exist yet but

412
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
what measurement would be the most

413
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,040
informative for you

414
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,079
oh

415
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
so

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
this is oh can you hear me yep

417
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
okay

418
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
um

419
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
microsoft says my microphone is noisy

420
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
but sometimes just the little background

421
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,920
sounds but it doesn't sound noisy to me

422
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,519
so i would let people know if it did

423
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,600
thanks

424
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
so i guess the approach i'm trying to do

425
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
is um

426
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
factorize as much as i can consciousness

427
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,839
into different senses of the word

428
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,320
and then try to bring those in

429
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
relation to each other in some coherent

430
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
way

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
and so

432
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,440
um i might think of consciousness in

433
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,839
terms of a set of uh concentric circles

434
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,399
which might be approached differently at

435
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
each level

436
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
so at maybe like the innermost

437
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
core shell we might have a minimalist

438
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
core you might have some kind of um

439
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,600
proto-creature consciousness we might

440
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
not even want to use the word some sort

441
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,160
of

442
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,000
organismic modeling

443
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,959
um

444
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,560
whether or not we talk about this terms

445
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,079
of consciousness could be a matter of

446
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,040
debate

447
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
and then

448
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
at some point we get to this like the

449
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,000
appearance of a world to a creature um

450
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
subjectivity uh what it is likeness

451
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
um

452
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,839
qualia

453
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,560
phenomenality

454
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
there's um

455
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
i i haven't heard like a definition that

456
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
really satisfies people universally and

457
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
they all sound very vague but just you

458
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
know the lights coming on what it is

459
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
like

460
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
uh to be us

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
um but then again since what is likeness

462
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,280
and then there's all the particular ways

463
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,079
of what it is like and now

464
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
the actual stream of experience is

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,039
shaped by

466
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
in different ways and has certain other

467
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,000
properties you might get into like

468
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
access consciousness so this would be

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,439
like networks distinctions between like

470
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
phenomenal consciousness or your

471
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,760
experience itself and this would be

472
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,039
where the framework like integrated

473
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
information theory would come in

474
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
um or you might have uh then another

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
level of complexity access consciousness

476
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,360
or the ability to manipulate um on the

477
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
objects of experience in your mind or

478
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
and report on them

479
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,600
um to have knowledge of them

480
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
but then it's like we're still somewhat

481
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
vague in terms of

482
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
what we mean by um uh knowledge of like

483
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
what how much knowledge what kind of and

484
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
so you might have even more

485
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,720
complexifications things like

486
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,320
self-consciousness like autonomic or

487
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
reflexive consciousness

488
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
and um it's

489
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
there there might not be like any bound

490
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
in terms of the complexification and so

491
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
at each level you might have a different

492
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,520
handling

493
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
and as you go like out at the outer

494
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,840
shells it seems like they blend

495
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,240
themselves best to operate

496
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
authorizationalization and

497
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
experimentation

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
where it's you know you can actually do

499
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,559
tests

500
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,120
did you um pass the mirror test even

501
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
though people

502
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
uh debate about what that means like do

503
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,960
you have certain can you report what's

504
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
the nature of the reports um how

505
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
sophisticated are they as you're dealing

506
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
with the more complex varieties of

507
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
conscious experience

508
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
so that's very straightforwardly lend

509
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
itself to empiricism as you start to go

510
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
into uh like i guess the phenomenality

511
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,960
itself to the to the degree that we want

512
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
to hold to this distinction between

513
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
phenomenal access consciousness or

514
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
different kinds i personally make use of

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
it but

516
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
once you get to experience itself you

517
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
have the problem of the first person

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
versus third person ontology the

519
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
privateness of it it's like you can make

520
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,559
inferences

521
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,679
about

522
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,919
different systems based on

523
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
their properties and what you think is

524
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
helpful for realizing

525
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
uh what might allow a world to appear to

526
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
a certain type of system but you can't

527
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
know because consciousness is private

528
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,440
you can only comment it indirectly and

529
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,160
so

530
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
it's

531
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
there's things like no report paradigms

532
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
people work with things like you know

533
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,600
are there coherent like um

534
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,960
most recently a paper just came out

535
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
looking for basically um uh

536
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
neurodynamics and are they responsive in

537
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,240
a certain way that um suggests like a

538
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
sensitivity to knowledge but still it's

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
an indirect influence and it's a problem

540
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,200
it seems like we always have to go

541
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
through usually

542
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,120
by some degree of directness report

543
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,840
and

544
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
to get it experienced

545
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,679
so it's to actually like where the

546
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
rubber hits the road of the initial

547
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
emergence of a world appearing to a

548
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
system

549
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
it's as far as i'm concerned really

550
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
super fraught and so my best attempt has

551
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
been to try to basically cross reference

552
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
as many perspectives as possible and try

553
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
to basically like line up

554
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,039
all three of like marion levels

555
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,679
to the extent i can of functional

556
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
algorithmic and implementation level

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,840
cross references with phenomenality and

558
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
then try to say okay

559
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,200
what types of

560
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,039
computational principles what types of

561
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
algorithms might help to create a world

562
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
that could appear

563
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
to a system

564
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,679
and

565
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
um

566
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
further thoughts on that but

567
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
i can

568
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
stop for now and keep talking about it

569
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
thanks

570
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
for this um this idea of

571
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,159
cross-referencing doing the scholarship

572
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
and really being up to date with what

573
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,000
people are actually asking and the ways

574
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,679
that they're really investigating it and

575
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,400
then looking for some underlying or some

576
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
inner

577
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
generative processes it's very

578
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,400
similar to what is being done in um

579
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
wonders

580
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
previous work on the minimum minimum

581
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,520
unifying models which is like could we

582
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
find a cluster of attributes that seem

583
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,400
to be

584
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,799
um co-extant like they're existing

585
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
together and then could there be some

586
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
minimal underlying

587
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
um speculated model that would lead to

588
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,159
those clusters of traits and then would

589
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
that help us design better experiments

590
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
reduce our uncertainty about how to act

591
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
and then the other part that i would

592
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
just ask about is like you know we hear

593
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
a lot about first person that's the i

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,559
and then we hear a lot about third

595
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
person like third person um bird's eye

596
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,760
view but then i'm wondering about this

597
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
second person because that's actually

598
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
where dave's questions um

599
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
about the no consciousness without

600
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
dialogue or without

601
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
interchange of information

602
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,120
as well as um

603
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,320
vygotsky and even demetrius boluses and

604
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
showbox work on becoming

605
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,919
who

606
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
we are through interaction so it's just

607
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,200
like

608
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,760
will we be able to localize it in the

609
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,159
brain or in the brain body or in the

610
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,960
brain body niche in the social niche

611
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
because if it turns out that it's

612
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
something that's distributed a little

613
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,039
bit beyond the cranium

614
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
then maybe neural measurements matter

615
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,360
maybe button tapping can matter

616
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,799
just like you could have one thermometer

617
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,480
and make an assessment about a broader

618
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
area but we shouldn't confuse the map in

619
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
the territory or the measurement and the

620
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,360
territory if we think it's relational

621
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
then any kind of objective measurement

622
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,200
is only ever going to tell a partial

623
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,159
picture

624
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
what do you think about that dave or how

625
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,520
does the second person come into play

626
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
i don't think i can advance the

627
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
discussion right now

628
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
yeah all good positions

629
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
yeah go ahead adam

630
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,440
um so

631
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
i think

632
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,679
in terms of like the release so i've

633
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
tended to um in terms of like degrees of

634
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,760
i guess internalism versus externalism

635
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,440
um i tended to i guess separate out

636
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
consciousness or

637
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
experience

638
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,320
from

639
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
a mind or intelligence

640
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,240
or modeling

641
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,200
where i think like the relevant um

642
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
generative modeling for

643
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
intelligence or mind would indeed be

644
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
distributed and extended and would spill

645
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
out beyond and exist between agents

646
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,400
um i've tended to reserve um

647
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
thinking of like a subset of these

648
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
generative processes a subset of

649
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
generative modeling

650
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
um

651
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,919
as being kind of stuck in the cranium of

652
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
the generation of consciousness itself

653
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,600
um

654
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,880
the and

655
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
even more i've tended to actually like

656
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
restrict it to even like not the full

657
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
like i wouldn't like draw the boundary

658
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
or the markov blanket across the whole

659
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
nervous system but actually

660
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,760
within the scope of these sort of

661
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
metastable

662
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
um

663
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
synchronous complexes which

664
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,679
through their synchrony would entail i

665
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
guess message passing in the calculation

666
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,559
of a

667
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,440
a joint estimate

668
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
over the entire

669
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,760
sensorium of the agent of its

670
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
embodied embedded interaction with the

671
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,799
world

672
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
and so for me this would be like not

673
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,720
even like the whole when these estimates

674
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,080
are being generated when these

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
metastable states are forming you could

676
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
think of them as a kind of um

677
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,080
non-equilibrium steady state um

678
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
that

679
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,799
there would be a

680
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,120
a general boundary around them that

681
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
wouldn't include the whole nervous

682
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
system and on the act

683
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
and but

684
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,960
um in terms of like practically

685
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
what would

686
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
so so in terms of like so in terms of

687
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,480
like the onion of consciousness in terms

688
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,799
of like the kind of consciousnesses that

689
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,039
we have that the exact nature of our

690
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
streams of experience our our

691
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,640
self-consciousness

692
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
and you know our

693
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
biographical you know auto and allo

694
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
biographical consciousness

695
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
um

696
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
that would definitely be relational that

697
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,080
would definitely be um

698
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
uh

699
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
even if like the like the pulp the

700
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
generative pulses for

701
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
the qualia might not be and any given

702
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
well they might be confined in the skull

703
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
the processes that where whereby

704
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
you would come to

705
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,679
model yourself in the world and we'd be

706
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
able to coordinate and just live that

707
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,279
would definitely be relational

708
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,559
um but

709
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,200
um i'm wondering whether the initial

710
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
generation of phenomenal itself while

711
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
practically

712
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
requiring for at least for mammals and

713
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
birds most of them

714
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
this communication this relationality

715
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,480
sometimes even maybe like a

716
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
bootstrapping or a back and forth

717
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
between perspectives between a second

718
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
person point of view and a first person

719
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
to actually

720
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
like you figure figuring out like who am

721
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
i by figuring out

722
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,039
that through interaction like who are

723
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,279
you who am i who am i in relation to you

724
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
and this is how you bootstrap the whole

725
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
thing and also just practically like um

726
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
i think you're later gonna have like

727
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,120
anna on and like this perspective of

728
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,279
like inherent interdependence you're not

729
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,559
gonna even be

730
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
homeostatic at all without the

731
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
relationality and so like the first

732
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
priors the exact nature of your

733
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,120
consciousness deeply interdependent that

734
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,159
being said

735
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,559
i wonder whether you can have systems

736
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,400
that are never in relation to any other

737
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
system

738
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
except for the world itself

739
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
and that

740
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,120
and that that they come to model

741
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
and that if they have the right

742
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,320
architecture that the

743
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,840
this could entail

744
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,400
an integrated world model

745
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
which would there be something that's

746
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
like to be such a system i don't know

747
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,640
where this begins and ends

748
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,679
but i have speculations but those are

749
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,120
some thoughts

750
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
it's definitely

751
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
clarifying where you're coming from with

752
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
the integrated world modeling it's

753
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,400
almost like if you could have a program

754
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,840
on a computer

755
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,400
that you you could know what was getting

756
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
passed into the program so you could say

757
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,279
yes when i hit run this program is going

758
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
to start from nothing or from the kernel

759
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,640
that i've specified and then if it ends

760
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,480
up doing this autopoesis or

761
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
self-reflection and then can do things

762
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,200
like the mirror test or

763
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
responding in a way that is akin to a

764
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
person

765
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,679
then

766
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
at least from a computational

767
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,080
perspective it's exhibiting some of

768
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
these important

769
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,399
features or attributes now you're still

770
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,760
going to have people who deny

771
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,480
consciousness or think everything has it

772
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
so for me

773
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
the question will

774
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
eternally be open because there's going

775
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
to be people who say it's all just an

776
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
illusion or it's not real

777
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,559
even for humans and there's other people

778
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,840
say well you just don't understand the

779
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
electron consciousness so you know

780
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
there's no point in even you know trying

781
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
to falsify that so it's going to remain

782
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,520
an open distribution

783
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
but we may be able to

784
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,559
focus

785
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,720
on some of these interesting

786
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,559
differences between ourselves and the

787
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,919
computational system it's like a little

788
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,760
model system

789
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
it's not the same thing as us but um

790
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
let's return to this computational

791
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
question because i think

792
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,080
it's related to the next question

793
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,440
with a jpeg of a hand reaching out to

794
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
the sky

795
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,279
how do we relate

796
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,320
experience or phenomenology

797
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,200
to

798
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
neural computational and all ad

799
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
behavioral dimensions

800
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,480
so

801
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
how do we connect

802
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
seemingly

803
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
it's it's like a a marketplace of two

804
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
different types you got the soda machine

805
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,799
that transforms the dollars into the

806
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,840
soda cans but how are we going to go

807
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
back and forth from a behavioral

808
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
observation to

809
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,559
phenomenology to computational i think

810
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,880
this is just it's definitely an open

811
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
question

812
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,200
like these are

813
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,159
just

814
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,760
starting point

815
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
discussions because

816
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,480
they're not resolved questions i would

817
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
say people barely even know what the

818
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,320
structure of a resolution would look

819
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,120
like

820
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
but it has related to

821
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,159
this

822
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
question we just asked which is for a

823
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
virtual machine or for any type of

824
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
system

825
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
for it to interface out

826
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,039
to the outside world so in active

827
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
inference we call that action states

828
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
whether it's typing or your voice box or

829
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
whether it's your eye movements it's an

830
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,840
active state um it's part of the blanket

831
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
states with sense and action so however

832
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,120
you come to know about a system through

833
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
the act action and sensory states

834
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,399
you're not going to have access to those

835
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
internal states and then it's almost

836
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,919
like even if you knew it those internal

837
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,000
states where it wouldn't always clarify

838
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
the situation so

839
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,120
how do we um think about this connection

840
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
or the interface between systems of

841
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
different kinds virtual machines

842
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,640
or

843
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
seemingly conscious systems how are

844
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
those linked to the outside world and

845
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,360
how do we

846
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,840
talk about that rigorously and then i

847
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,799
believe it was um cambridge breaths last

848
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
time who just

849
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
at the end brought up this question

850
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,760
about quantum and classical computation

851
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,200
it's not

852
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
something i know a ton about but it's

853
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,000
interesting to think about whether the

854
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,039
sort of

855
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,480
turing computation zero one von neumann

856
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
architecture just what people think of

857
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
when they hear a computer just like this

858
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,880
laptop in front of me

859
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,320
how is that

860
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
part of a broader perspective on

861
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
computation especially when we're

862
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
thinking about computational dimensions

863
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,760
like we're not just thinking about

864
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
windows 10 we're thinking maybe about

865
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,960
unconventional computation and

866
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,240
um

867
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
so these were just some questions that

868
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,720
people addressed if anyone

869
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,399
has a thought they can go for it

870
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
otherwise we can just keep on walking

871
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,039
through it yep go for it

872
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,720
so i guess um

873
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
i might start with um

874
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
neural behavioral in terms of like in

875
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,279
the systems where i think i have some

876
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,760
understanding and then move into more

877
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
general like

878
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
types of computational systems that

879
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
could potentially

880
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,440
realize things similarly whether we're

881
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,640
talking about

882
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
like a von neumann architecture

883
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,120
or like the blackhead experiment with

884
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
the nation of china

885
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
or

886
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,080
like use social insect colonies

887
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
or

888
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
you know any kind of system but like

889
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
starting from i guess where we have

890
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,519
maybe the most purchase

891
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
it would seem

892
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,000
to me

893
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,039
um

894
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,399
that experience

895
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,360
would correspond to potentially

896
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,399
or try to like identify a

897
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,000
neurocomputational object of a joint

898
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
marginal distribution

899
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,840
um

900
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,799
from a probabilistic world model

901
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,519
which would over you basically the

902
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,840
sensorium of the organism as as it is

903
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,760
coupling with the world

904
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,799
and so

905
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,519
for

906
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,000
me it would be basically an estimation

907
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,880
of

908
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,120
a visual spatial field

909
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,960
um which would connect to like uh

910
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
rudroff's work with the projected

911
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
conscious modeling a point of view

912
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
but also

913
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,919
um the feeling of having a body the

914
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,120
lived body

915
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,000
and the relation between these things um

916
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
potentially involving something like an

917
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
attention schema like bringing like

918
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,279
graziano's type of work and so i'm

919
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,159
basically thinking like all like

920
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,600
many different theories of consciousness

921
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,720
are actually pointing to different

922
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,559
aspects of what we need with none of

923
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,039
them being uh on their own jointly

924
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,880
sufficient but if we bring them together

925
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
we might be able to get joint

926
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
sufficiency and so

927
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
the idea in terms of neural substrates

928
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,360
i'm thinking that the appearance of a

929
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,039
visual world could correspond to

930
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,000
basically

931
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
um some kind of maybe the pecunius um

932
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
this like midline structure as like the

933
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,720
top of the since the top of the visual

934
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,679
spatial sensorium um coupling with the

935
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,320
posterior cingulate um

936
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,559
and the reason i would like point to

937
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,679
these i guess would be partially

938
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,880
empirically in terms of like what

939
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
happens if you lesion these areas

940
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,799
and also the types of information

941
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
available to them so it's both like

942
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,399
where they are their high centrality um

943
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,320
being hierarchically higher

944
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
the empirical associations like if you

945
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
lesion the posterior the pecunius you're

946
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,919
going to have um

947
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
lots of problems but also in terms of

948
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,760
mental imagery this is like these would

949
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,399
be

950
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,720
neural corals that tend to be associated

951
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
i i bring in like the cingulate because

952
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,799
you're seeing that because um basically

953
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,159
i think that area might be the most

954
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,760
crucial one for establishing a

955
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,320
particular point of view on the world

956
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
so you would have there's this like old

957
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,080
idea of the pez circuit where um he was

958
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,120
basically um dropping electrodes kind of

959
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
like figure out epileptic form loci and

960
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
you feel like this highly central

961
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
inner circuit for emotional memory where

962
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
you go from the mammillary bodies

963
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,360
to i think it's like the

964
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
anterior lateral thalamus

965
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,519
posterior cingulate into the hippocampal

966
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,559
formation

967
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,840
out through the phorinx back to the

968
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,480
mammary bodies and like this this basic

969
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,520
loop

970
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,918
of emotional memory i bring it up

971
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,159
because if you think of the types of

972
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,119
information that you would get there

973
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,639
part of what the mammillary bodies are

974
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,320
doing is they have this um stretch

975
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
receptor information from the neck and

976
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
so this will actually tell you like

977
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
where your inner lamprey's head is

978
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,760
pointing

979
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,399
and then if you go to the um the

980
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
thalamic nuclei they're now getting that

981
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
information they're also getting

982
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,760
information from the vestibular

983
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,040
apparatus

984
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,359
and so you have from the inner ear this

985
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,560
like crazy conch shell nautilus i don't

986
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
know how to describe this like crazy

987
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
shape that basically has these like

988
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
little particles that move around and

989
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,199
stimulate these hair cells that cause

990
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
different action potentials so basically

991
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
you can get the yaw pitch and roll of

992
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,199
the head

993
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,560
and so you're getting both like the

994
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
positional and the vector information of

995
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
your head

996
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,960
coming into

997
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,800
this area before it feeds into the

998
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
hippocampus's top of the cortical cutter

999
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,480
or gate that basically gets your entire

1000
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,160
sensorium all the modalities coming

1001
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,960
together pegged according to what you

1002
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,119
need for an egocentric uh perspective

1003
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
and reference frame anyway so that would

1004
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,800
be like any human

1005
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,960
yeah just one one note on this because i

1006
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
think it's really important is um the

1007
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,240
question of estimating a visual field

1008
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,119
isn't like just what a convolutional

1009
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,359
neural network does it's not just a fill

1010
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,839
in the dots paint by lines

1011
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,560
as we heard from rudraf and willaford

1012
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,760
and and others it's actually a very

1013
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,839
of a complex affordance driven

1014
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,720
projective model

1015
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,560
that entails a locus of the observer so

1016
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,960
if a computer is trying to auto complete

1017
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,320
some image

1018
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,119
it is taking a matrix and it's doing

1019
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,040
transformations based upon statistical

1020
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,280
regularities in a matrix so we can sort

1021
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,240
of computationally sketch that out but

1022
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,240
in the um locus of our awareness

1023
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,400
visually even it's not quite even the

1024
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,640
same computational problem because it's

1025
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,839
integrated like you're saying with um

1026
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
inputs of information that we can

1027
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,839
observe and you you made a great point

1028
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,079
with the the neck position and then the

1029
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,240
angle of your ear

1030
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
it's probably super non-linear how that

1031
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,320
gets integrated into the control

1032
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
mechanisms but that's like the um

1033
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
gyroscope and acceleration on a phone

1034
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
it actually does convey the information

1035
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,119
about

1036
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,400
the pitch and direction but then it's

1037
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,599
being conveyed in this very

1038
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,359
action-oriented way and that's

1039
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,200
egocentric action oriented because

1040
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,160
otherwise

1041
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,200
if you're if you're calculating the

1042
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
actions for somebody else

1043
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,800
what's the point

1044
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,160
and in some ways it might even be the

1045
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
lion's share of the information and like

1046
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,640
except for rare circumstances like

1047
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,000
unless you're in like the midst of a

1048
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,640
gale force hurricane it might be like

1049
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,800
the most

1050
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,119
purchase you have on like what the like

1051
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
what is causing the most change in your

1052
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
sensorium would be your own

1053
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
self-generated actions whether we're

1054
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
talking about like overt motions or like

1055
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,359
now i'm changing what's coming in or

1056
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,920
like even just the might like or cicadas

1057
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,200
at three times a second or even like

1058
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,280
these potentially faster jiggles and

1059
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,119
microcycles like it's actually all

1060
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,960
coming from you and if you're gonna try

1061
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,880
to make sense of like make sense of your

1062
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
sensors without this it might be pretty

1063
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
hopeless unless you're actually

1064
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
accounting for this inactive

1065
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
embedded

1066
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,359
like

1067
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
situating of of of what's coming in

1068
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
and so yeah you need all this

1069
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,400
information

1070
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,760
for uh

1071
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,040
you know we're not just like sitting

1072
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
there locked in

1073
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,320
videos being displayed in us with our

1074
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
eyes open like in clockwork orange you

1075
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,960
know it's we're actually engaged in the

1076
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,720
world and even there your eyes are

1077
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
moving around even there would be

1078
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,240
hopeless without the efference copy

1079
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
here's a fun thing is in active

1080
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
inference we know that the imperative is

1081
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,960
to reduce surprise minimize free energy

1082
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,880
of a system and there's two ways the

1083
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,359
system can go about doing that it can

1084
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
learn which is updating its internal

1085
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,640
model or it can act so you could do

1086
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,480
action or inference

1087
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,119
integrated under the same imperative and

1088
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,760
so let's think about this super

1089
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,480
clockwork orange 1984 situation where

1090
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
even the oculomotor

1091
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
muscles have been paralyzed so someone

1092
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
cannot blink they can't move their eyes

1093
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,640
and they're get they're they're it's

1094
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
like just they can't act at all they're

1095
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,440
maybe in a hopeless yes

1096
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
in that situation

1097
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
there would be an internal experience

1098
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,560
let's just say

1099
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,440
and um because they couldn't

1100
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,880
act

1101
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
all the adaptation and the free energy

1102
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,119
minimization would have to be

1103
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,720
based upon their internal model now

1104
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
their internal model could be a

1105
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,839
crystallization of i don't like what's

1106
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,760
happening to me and i'm not

1107
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,119
listening to the propaganda and that's

1108
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,440
not me for example

1109
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
but that's not um always

1110
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,079
maybe the case and then we can go from

1111
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,880
that super limited uh situation

1112
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
into cases where we actually do have

1113
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,119
degrees of freedom of action

1114
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
and degrees of freedom of thought and

1115
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,440
it's a really interesting point that

1116
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,000
our active experimentation in the

1117
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,359
environment

1118
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,560
is what is leading along the trajectory

1119
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,400
of our experience it's like oh what's on

1120
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,079
the other side of this pen i picked it

1121
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,079
up and now all the experiences my arm

1122
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,079
all my visual field is different but

1123
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,480
that wasn't externally induced

1124
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960
it was part of an endogenous

1125
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
active sequence of active

1126
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
experimentation in the niche

1127
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
and then

1128
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,839
so it's really okay cool that's where we

1129
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,920
get action and inference coming together

1130
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
so continue on

1131
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
like an ai like they're trying to like

1132
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
figure out how to get inductive biases

1133
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
for things like objectness and different

1134
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
kinds of core knowledge

1135
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,720
and i think it's actually um a real

1136
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,400
problem that they're

1137
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
that this inactivist perspective is

1138
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,040
lacking

1139
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
because they just want to sort of like

1140
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,599
plop in um different as coronology's

1141
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,920
different evolutionary priors as

1142
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,119
inductive biases right from the

1143
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,880
beginning so it's like you have somehow

1144
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,000
you know wave your hands bay's magic

1145
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,720
object is prior causation you might have

1146
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
things such as this but it's going to

1147
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
actually be helpful

1148
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
for an object inspire if the system

1149
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
actually has

1150
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,079
experience with objects that might be

1151
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,400
helpful and and it's still this idea

1152
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
that like you're trying to solve vision

1153
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
completely divorced

1154
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,319
from the engagement with the world so

1155
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,960
you can actually like reach up and

1156
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,440
if you have experiences like do

1157
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
touching and moving things around it's

1158
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,880
like huh i have uncertainty i'm gonna

1159
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,000
like you're just saying i can resolve my

1160
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
energy

1161
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
oh that's what's on the other side and

1162
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,079
now i'm building up an object model and

1163
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,520
now i'm building up causal models of

1164
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,880
like what happens if like i let go of

1165
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
this i'm not going to do it but

1166
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,400
now you've had

1167
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,880
a sense of the causation of the world

1168
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
that is basically allowing you to have

1169
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,640
this internal model instead of just like

1170
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,880
hammering it into the architecture

1171
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
somehow through something like you know

1172
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
some sort of architectural prior i'm not

1173
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,520
that those things don't exist and are

1174
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,200
going to be crucially important

1175
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,680
but i think it's completely hopeless

1176
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,359
that they're going to solve that

1177
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,119
enduring problem of ai

1178
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,240
without

1179
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,920
this inactivist perspective i think it's

1180
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
just the hypothesis space is way too

1181
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,079
unconstrained you will be lost there

1182
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
forever you can throw all the compute of

1183
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,319
the universe at it it still might not be

1184
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,079
enough i could be wrong about that but

1185
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,960
that's

1186
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
yep oh that's a clean

1187
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,119
another way of thinking about that is

1188
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,599
like let's say the space of all possible

1189
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,200
chess boards or the space of all

1190
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,000
possible cup designs it's a big number

1191
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
but actually the space of all strategies

1192
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,520
for chess

1193
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,040
it has to be bigger than the number of

1194
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,720
chess boards because any chess board

1195
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,800
there's multiple strategies or the strat

1196
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,400
the number of strategies for determining

1197
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
the coffee cup like what is each joint

1198
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,000
gonna do

1199
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,920
as you're seeking to infer what kind of

1200
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,240
coffee cup it is again it's like chess

1201
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
strategies it's another level

1202
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,680
of strategy above the state

1203
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,720
and so active inference sort of cuts the

1204
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,520
knot

1205
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,160
on seemingly the simpler problem how do

1206
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,680
we figure out what kind of coffee cup it

1207
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,760
is rather than just doing exhaustive

1208
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
mapping of all possible coffee cups we

1209
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,079
actually step back to asking what

1210
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,079
strategy is going to help us resolve

1211
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,400
uncertainty about the coffee cup

1212
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
and then that strategy

1213
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,040
might be encapsulated with just a few

1214
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,640
lines of pseudo code like a good

1215
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
strategy for game theory might be start

1216
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,560
nice and retaliate but then act randomly

1217
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,640
once in a while and forget sometimes

1218
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,319
something like that that's quite a

1219
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,680
compression

1220
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,240
of a lot of things that are relational

1221
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,640
in the world and so it's almost like

1222
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,119
sometimes the state estimate is

1223
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,720
too hard or not even what we really want

1224
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,240
to know you don't want every pixel in hd

1225
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,160
of your visual field you need to know

1226
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,880
how to act and then that way even if

1227
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,160
you're um

1228
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,720
if you have something in your eye or one

1229
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,560
eye is injured or there's some sort of

1230
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,960
other visual impairment or even no

1231
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
visual input

1232
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
someone can still act

1233
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,480
effectively whereas if you just have an

1234
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,880
image recognition module you disconnect

1235
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,520
that and now it's like you're you're you

1236
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
know walking on

1237
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,599
nothing but if you have action as the

1238
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,119
core loop

1239
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
and then sense as it is an active

1240
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
inference is being integrated to the

1241
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,640
extent um that it shapes action it's a

1242
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
very different perspective than sort of

1243
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,119
this input process output

1244
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,200
control theory model and i think this is

1245
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
going to come back in a second when we

1246
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,000
look at the circular closed causality of

1247
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
the actual action inference loop with a

1248
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,560
blanket state intermediating so that's

1249
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,400
pretty cool any other thoughts there

1250
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,680
um i guess along those lines um

1251
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,440
something that's something an open

1252
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
question for me right now

1253
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,520
and also speaks to like illusionism you

1254
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,119
mentioned recently um i i

1255
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,119
i kind of bristle against all things

1256
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,640
illusionist um in that like uh i think

1257
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,599
indeed

1258
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,680
i think it implies things like it

1259
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,280
implies things like you are not

1260
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
conscious or that consciousness is not

1261
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,160
um an important um

1262
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,240
basically adaptation or component of

1263
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
experience but this the idea that it

1264
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,440
might be different than we think i think

1265
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,319
is valid and useful so in that sense

1266
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
i like illusionism but i also bristle

1267
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,760
against it but the idea with though

1268
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,119
being with this sort of

1269
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,359
the the most useful compression and the

1270
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,760
most useful like how is the how is it

1271
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,240
encoded um

1272
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,400
what is the richness of experience we

1273
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,880
could actually be somewhat mistaken

1274
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
and that it might be as if we have this

1275
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,880
hd visual field all available to us all

1276
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,520
at once or it might just be when we

1277
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,720
query it

1278
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
we can have it when we need it

1279
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,400
and so um like i think uh is it a reagan

1280
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,599
i think like with sensory motor

1281
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,000
contingency theory that's his model and

1282
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
it's more extended and it's like you

1283
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
just query the environment

1284
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,480
but um potentially like even internally

1285
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,680
you might just be querying an entailed

1286
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,400
like generative world model and it might

1287
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,079
even be potentially

1288
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,280
at the

1289
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,599
resolution of the sensory engagements

1290
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,599
themselves which are like for instance

1291
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,079
for visual sampling you have basically

1292
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,400
for the phobia it's it's a thumbnail

1293
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,079
held out at arm's length that's

1294
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,760
basically all you got

1295
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,160
and so it might be in any given moment

1296
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,240
that is actually what's in your ex your

1297
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
visual experience it could be but it's

1298
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,160
just you're moving it around and so you

1299
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
never notice because there's no place to

1300
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,000
stand to look at yourself not realizing

1301
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,040
it's like kind of like the

1302
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
refrigerator-like like whenever you open

1303
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,240
it there it is

1304
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,040
um

1305
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,040
interesting so it delights this one

1306
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,040
i map like though like part of like

1307
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,960
perceptually like i suggest that there

1308
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,560
is some sort of richer filling and this

1309
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
is part of like i think so like um i've

1310
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,720
suggested and can i have suggested that

1311
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
like you can think of cortex in terms of

1312
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,480
principles of like variational auto

1313
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
encoders and part of what they can do is

1314
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,119
they can fill in a more rich thing so

1315
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,720
for instance they might be used for

1316
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,520
instance like for like a a 4k or an 8k

1317
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,040
television or something for like super

1318
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,440
resolution for up sampling and you have

1319
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,319
a

1320
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,079
more impoverished signal and then you

1321
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,680
film the missing details or you have

1322
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,760
like an included image and then you fill

1323
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,119
in wasn't there and this maybe this is

1324
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,319
like for instance

1325
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,079
partially how we handle the blind spot

1326
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,359
that's unclear

1327
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,240
but how much filling in exactly happens

1328
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,560
i have no idea it could be just like

1329
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,480
almost like an etch-a-sketch thing that

1330
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,359
is at the really shockingly

1331
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,040
low dimensional

1332
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,079
uh

1333
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,319
resolution of the actual sensors

1334
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,200
themselves or not i don't know

1335
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
another thought on the richness or the

1336
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,599
paucity those are comparators they're

1337
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,119
relative terms and so imagine another

1338
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,040
agent in the niche has different

1339
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,440
affordances and say only 400 to 700

1340
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,079
nanometers you know you can't see

1341
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,480
anything beyond this it's like who's

1342
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,440
having a rich experience now and so we

1343
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,800
are having our experience and then as

1344
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,319
you're pointing out

1345
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,040
feeling like things are uh not changing

1346
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,800
or like we have good clarity outside of

1347
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,280
our main focal point that's a story

1348
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,640
we're telling ourselves that actually

1349
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,920
might be a very adaptive and

1350
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,559
self-protective belief because if it's

1351
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,160
the case that when we're unsure about

1352
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,520
something it produces or it is anxiety

1353
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,240
and then tunnel vision is like sort of

1354
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,280
our de facto sensory reality as far as

1355
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,119
what the resolution capacity of the

1356
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,040
retina is so

1357
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,119
how do you square the circle with

1358
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,079
limited sensory capacity but not wanting

1359
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,920
to have over anxiety well you make rapid

1360
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,079
cicading and then you have a continual

1361
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,400
story that everything is okay until

1362
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,640
something semantically is not okay in

1363
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,480
the visual field um dave

1364
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,920
yeah uh did you see the uh

1365
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,079
the youtube address that i just sent

1366
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,400
through chat several minutes ago

1367
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,640
um i don't look at any chats during the

1368
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,319
live stream but what can you tell us

1369
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,680
about it or how would people find it

1370
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,559
yeah

1371
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,839
yeah this is a recent um

1372
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,440
presentation by mark sorms about

1373
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,040
uh why

1374
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
summarizing his rece his book that just

1375
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,839
came out um and he's

1376
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,400
he's he's addressing how it is that

1377
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,880
thomas nagle and david chalmers ask

1378
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,040
these really good questions really

1379
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,359
important questions super smart people

1380
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,280
the tremendous amount of knowledge have

1381
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,839
been working at this for decades

1382
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,400
and they've some of them are despairing

1383
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,720
how can we ever possibly answer these

1384
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,760
questions

1385
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,119
and he said well if you refuse to pay

1386
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,839
attention to the brain

1387
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,680
stem and the midbrain and think you're

1388
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,359
going to find the answers to

1389
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,079
consciousness and what it's to be like

1390
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:54,880
and

1391
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,720
feeling

1392
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,319
in the cortex

1393
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,480
you are not going to find it because it

1394
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,640
ain't there there is you want to know

1395
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,559
what does it feel like and you want to

1396
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,079
look at and you're you've confined

1397
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,839
yourself to a part of the brain where

1398
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,400
feeling isn't happening the part that

1399
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,240
isn't dedicated to feeling but rather is

1400
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
a sort of

1401
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,280
you might say computing machine that

1402
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,839
might pick up some consciousness when

1403
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,800
the brain stem needs the neocortex to do

1404
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,040
consciousness rather to help it do

1405
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,400
consciousness

1406
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,800
so i'll send um

1407
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,160
i don't know maybe i should send an

1408
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,480
email or the other thing leave a comment

1409
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,920
on this youtube video and if someone's

1410
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,119
curious they'll check back out i don't

1411
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,720
know if i can do that i don't know that

1412
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,800
i i've tried to put comments on the

1413
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,119
youtube and i see no evidence that

1414
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,200
anything that i put in ever goes

1415
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,280
anywhere that anybody can see

1416
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
interesting

1417
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,480
but anyhow yeah but suddenly you can put

1418
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,200
it in the in the the text maybe later on

1419
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760
the other thing uh maybe you both heard

1420
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,240
me talk about this before but uh some

1421
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,760
folks working on uh

1422
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,119
the memory

1423
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,680
that's used for chess the recognition of

1424
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,680
chess positions

1425
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,079
uh they took a bunch of people from just

1426
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,319
really beginners who just basically know

1427
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,319
only how you can move what are the legal

1428
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,440
moves to really good players to masters

1429
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,680
and they would give them chest positions

1430
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,200
and let them look at it for a few

1431
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,839
seconds or 30 seconds or however long

1432
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,079
that was that was varied and then say

1433
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,640
now write it down for me or just say

1434
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,800
tell me what you can remember about it

1435
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,520
you know 30 60 seconds or 15 minutes

1436
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,359
later

1437
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,960
and

1438
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,040
in a real position

1439
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,960
the master was really really good they

1440
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,359
could sometimes reproduce all of the

1441
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,480
pieces in an endgame or a mid game

1442
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,680
and the amateurs couldn't could barely

1443
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
do it at all they say well uh white's

1444
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,440
kind of still in white's territory and

1445
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,920
the right side of the board had a lot of

1446
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,040
stuff in it but if they put up

1447
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,760
impossible positions positions that you

1448
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,640
cannot possibly legally move position

1449
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,880
pieces into

1450
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
the masters would get really upset

1451
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,599
because they couldn't remember i don't

1452
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,599
know i don't know

1453
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,559
in fact the amateurs were better than

1454
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,000
the masters

1455
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,839
at reproducing

1456
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,720
impossible boards

1457
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,480
and the folks analyzing this said this

1458
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,960
well it seems like people don't remem

1459
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,920
people who know chess don't remember

1460
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,079
positions at all

1461
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,079
they remember

1462
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,599
trajectories

1463
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,200
that seems to be the only thing they

1464
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,960
remember and then they they drill down

1465
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,119
on that you know how can you distract

1466
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,920
from remembering trajectories and and so

1467
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
on and they says yeah this seems to be

1468
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,160
what people remember the meaningful

1469
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
moves they don't remember

1470
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,000
positions i think that might address

1471
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,839
some of the things adam was saying about

1472
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,839
what's what's really deflated what is

1473
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,559
really the more efficient way to to

1474
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,839
uh store data uh you've got storage in a

1475
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,680
computing machine

1476
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,200
and you've got

1477
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,359
the knowledge and the information and

1478
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,880
the

1479
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,520
information about my

1480
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,680
position and where i want to go from

1481
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,400
here

1482
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,079
the living brain uses and they may have

1483
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,760
no relation

1484
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,119
thanks for that dave and i'm going to

1485
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,800
pass to you adam with a question from

1486
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,599
the chat um cambridge breaths asks a

1487
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,960
question to adam regarding the

1488
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,280
computational approach to

1489
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,559
neurophenomenology how would the

1490
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,880
generative passages possibly help to

1491
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,480
describe consciousness in a way that

1492
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
generative models can't do

1493
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,640
so it sounds kind of related i'm not

1494
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,319
sure about the degenerative passage but

1495
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,880
it's sort of this trajectory idea i

1496
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,720
think is what we're getting at so

1497
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,559
anything you wanted to say or respond in

1498
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,800
that

1499
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,440
okay so um

1500
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,280
there's a few things off the stack and

1501
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,440
i'll address that if i can

1502
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
um or to the extent i can

1503
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,440
oh with relation to the um different

1504
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,000
types of um uh

1505
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
potential illusion or

1506
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,839
richness or lack thereof um just there's

1507
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,359
this one book that reviews a lot of

1508
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,200
these phenomena the mind is flat by nick

1509
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,559
shader

1510
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,520
which is interesting um

1511
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,720
i know if the book should be called the

1512
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,440
mind is flat or the mind is surprisingly

1513
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,680
rich and deep it just it's a better

1514
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
perspective but um

1515
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,640
with respect to and i also want to

1516
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,839
address uh psalms and the idea of a

1517
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,280
conscious brain stem which i'm going to

1518
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,200
push back on that a little bit

1519
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,800
um

1520
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,079
the

1521
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,680
but i guess i'll go to the generative

1522
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,760
passages versus um like generative model

1523
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
idea

1524
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,520
um and i i think that that first and i

1525
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,680
think that actually speaks to

1526
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,280
what you were saying daniel in terms of

1527
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,400
like

1528
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
wanting to have this balanced

1529
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,040
information like dealing with what's the

1530
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,960
information you actually got

1531
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,000
um and then what can the agent handle in

1532
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,839
terms of it's like um

1533
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,720
it's

1534
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,040
effective read on itself by which it's

1535
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,680
regulating itself as a cybernetic system

1536
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,599
not getting overwhelmed by uncertainty

1537
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,079
any given point and potentially a kind

1538
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,040
of

1539
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,200
additional filling in both for the sake

1540
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,240
of

1541
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,119
having

1542
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,400
um

1543
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,079
like a richer cause of the world but

1544
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,400
also just to not freak out the agent

1545
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
to allow it to be more copacetic

1546
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,079
in handling the uncertainty that it's

1547
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,839
going to have to handle

1548
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,280
in engaging with the world and trying to

1549
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,640
via potentially some sort of integrated

1550
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,839
world model

1551
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,040
now the

1552
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,200
i guess the

1553
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
i'm still um

1554
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
trying to understand aspects of the like

1555
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,440
so the distinction between uh so there's

1556
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,079
a pre-print that just came out um by

1557
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,400
maxwell ramsey and a few others on

1558
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,720
neurophenomenology which is which talks

1559
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,520
about

1560
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,760
this generative passage idea

1561
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,640
um but

1562
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,920
i guess part of it would be if

1563
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,960
the modeling processes we're doing are

1564
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,799
temporarily deep

1565
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,200
and they're counterfactually rich

1566
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,640
and this would be different than for

1567
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
instance just necessarily

1568
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,880
inverting

1569
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,400
your degenerate model from your

1570
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
sensoring so like for instance if you

1571
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,200
take

1572
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
the posterior lobes it might

1573
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,799
um

1574
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,559
which iit says are the physical

1575
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,880
substrates of consciousness and

1576
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,839
could be

1577
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,440
on another perspective viewed as like a

1578
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,000
kind of workspace that provides a global

1579
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,240
availability or could be viewed as like

1580
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,760
a predictive global journal workspace

1581
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,799
this could be

1582
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,079
um

1583
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,160
uh predicting what you think your

1584
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,640
century states are each at each point

1585
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,240
um

1586
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,559
this

1587
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,160
this could get you a good amount of

1588
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,520
temporal depth and counter factual

1589
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,839
richness however

1590
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,040
really though the unfolding is um

1591
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,079
not just a sequence of sensory estimates

1592
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,680
just stitched together your time but

1593
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,520
it's they're inactively stitched

1594
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,480
together through time where they're actu

1595
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,839
the whole process whether you're

1596
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,280
engaging the world or you're imagining

1597
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,599
it it's these action perception cycles

1598
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,119
and so now the frontal lobes are in the

1599
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,280
mix and now it's getting complicated but

1600
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,559
now the agent is shifting its

1601
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,319
perspective around

1602
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,079
um within either

1603
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,240
an actual world's engagement or some

1604
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,760
sort of virtual world

1605
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,720
and

1606
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,520
with some sort of relation between these

1607
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,559
and

1608
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,480
this is now more extended this is a

1609
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,920
different thing where um the closure of

1610
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,200
these functional cycles the

1611
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,400
informational closure um is

1612
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,599
more extended so things like for

1613
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,079
instance the temporal the the inherent

1614
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,839
depth of the present moment the sort of

1615
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,280
specious present

1616
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,599
that might be part of it in terms of for

1617
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,680
instance it's not just this

1618
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,160
as i'm suggesting like the actual quail

1619
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,319
are discrete they're being estimated at

1620
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,839
alpha frequencies

1621
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,400
primarily with a foci kind of

1622
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,160
encompassing the posterior lobes and

1623
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,680
this is where you're getting

1624
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,040
basically these nests these

1625
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,480
non-equilibrium steady state densities

1626
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,640
or i call them self-organizing harmonic

1627
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,400
modes and this is the stream of

1628
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,920
experience however

1629
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,480
the actual what's in the stream

1630
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,680
that's

1631
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,400
involving other things that's involving

1632
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,280
this the cybernetic action perception

1633
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,559
context and where it begins and ends um

1634
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,480
the actual operations engagement that's

1635
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,079
a different and much more complicated

1636
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,319
story and i think we're basically going

1637
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,000
to need to have things

1638
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,359
actually think like the hippocampal

1639
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,440
system might be at the core of that and

1640
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,880
that's going to be like the key puzzle

1641
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,040
piece i'm currently working on moving

1642
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,200
from basically this basic like what

1643
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,440
could do phenomenality to what could do

1644
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,280
these more complex forms i'm trying to

1645
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,799
grop the hippocampal system to figure

1646
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,640
that out but that's like one distinction

1647
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,079
between like generative

1648
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,359
i think i might speak to generative

1649
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,680
passages versus just the components of a

1650
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,400
gender model to be being inverted that

1651
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,760
could entail

1652
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,079
um basic

1653
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,599
creature consciousness phenomenally or

1654
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,880
just the the

1655
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,480
estimates of the world the stream of

1656
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,920
experience i don't know if that makes

1657
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,920
sense okay so one more thing though yeah

1658
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,839
or just one on the passage just we'll

1659
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,079
then we'll go to the other topic so

1660
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,160
think about um memorizing something like

1661
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,599
the chess board but think about

1662
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,839
memorizing a sequence of sounds so if

1663
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,240
there's sounds that you cannot make like

1664
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,400
um some sort of whistle or some sort of

1665
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,920
sound that a human can't make it's going

1666
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,520
to be really hard to memorize it you

1667
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,799
could recognize it but it's going to be

1668
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,880
hard to reproduce it now there's sounds

1669
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,400
that you can make in a language you

1670
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,160
don't know if you tried hard enough you

1671
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,680
might be able to memorize a song in a

1672
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,880
different language but it's going to be

1673
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,680
hard

1674
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,920
next would be in the scale of how easy

1675
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,079
it is to memorize would be like random

1676
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,000
words in english or language that one

1677
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,079
speaks but not grammatical that's like

1678
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,760
the chess boards that are impossible

1679
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,760
it's real pieces but it's not linked in

1680
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,000
a way okay now up another level of easy

1681
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,839
to memorize natural language like

1682
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,440
conversation could be pretty easy to

1683
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,720
memorize

1684
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,960
another layer up would be a composed

1685
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,839
natural language like a story or a poem

1686
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,760
and then even above the story or the

1687
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,640
poem

1688
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960
as we know from those who have great

1689
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
experience with memorizing

1690
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,920
epics

1691
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,880
is the embodied and the inactive poem so

1692
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,799
where um from the head of the story to

1693
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,359
the to the toes of the story or it it

1694
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,680
invokes your own body and so when we

1695
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,400
think about this generative passage it's

1696
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,599
almost like it's increasingly natural

1697
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,520
for us to um

1698
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,079
condense or to distill

1699
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,720
memory in terms of a narrative

1700
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,520
at increasingly inactive increasingly

1701
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,000
self-referential ways

1702
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,640
instead whereas stimuli that aren't able

1703
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,680
to be easily brought on board our own

1704
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,640
narrative

1705
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,559
in a relational way

1706
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,400
they're kind of like non-sequiturs to

1707
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,359
our

1708
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,480
memory

1709
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,960
and so that's who and what we are uh the

1710
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,480
stay of the system and how response and

1711
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,839
then also on the passage versus the

1712
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,440
generative model thinking about the

1713
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,040
generative model even though we know in

1714
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,400
active inference that it's beyond

1715
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,480
internalism and externalism and tale of

1716
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
two densities and so it's not just like

1717
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,559
the generative model is a matrix but

1718
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,960
thinking about a generative model makes

1719
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,640
you think that you can like pause the

1720
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,000
sensory input and just okay what's the

1721
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,680
state of the model but when we think

1722
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,920
about generative passages and trajectory

1723
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,040
estimates we get past present future we

1724
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,160
get self and other and we get planning

1725
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,079
under uncertainty so those are some of

1726
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,640
the very very key aspects of passage

1727
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,280
inference that aren't quite captured by

1728
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,040
just asking about generative model which

1729
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,079
makes it sound like you're doing like a

1730
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,880
linear regression

1731
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,359
okay then to the other aspect

1732
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,598
yep

1733
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,839
that was beautifully said uh

1734
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,720
um just need a moment

1735
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,680
okay

1736
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,919
um

1737
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,200
yeah so um

1738
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,880
okay so for i guess the the brainstem

1739
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,640
part um

1740
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,799
so

1741
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,839
i i really like um marx home's

1742
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,200
perspective and i'm actually uh

1743
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,839
very sympathetic to neuropsychoanalysis

1744
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,240
um i think it's developmental it's

1745
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,799
relational i think it um acknowledge

1746
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,119
like i think basically since we we are

1747
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,359
either you know we say

1748
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,040
because we're reinforcement learners it

1749
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,319
would be shocking if there weren't

1750
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,559
things like defense mechanisms because

1751
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,160
there's uh some thoughts you're having

1752
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
more of some things

1753
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,319
you're having less of and the

1754
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,200
contingencies of value and optimization

1755
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,599
are too numerous and varied sometimes

1756
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,200
subtle for you to track

1757
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,480
and so you can go down all sorts of

1758
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,119
garden paths so i'm generally like while

1759
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,200
the particular aspects of the freudian

1760
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
framework you might question i think we

1761
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,400
probably should be thinking something

1762
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,559
kind of psychoanalytic to get at the

1763
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,480
weirdness of mind and what it's like to

1764
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,799
be a person that being said

1765
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:49,920
um

1766
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,000
while i agree about the fundamental

1767
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,400
nature of the necessity

1768
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,319
of the brain stem

1769
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,200
as part of what's contributing to

1770
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,400
consciousness

1771
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,839
um as

1772
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,200
not just

1773
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,559
as being necessary you take it out

1774
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,640
you're done however

1775
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,720
the claim that brings himself is the

1776
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,119
locus of consciousness i find to be

1777
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,880
somewhat questionable

1778
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,200
um and that i think we're in an even

1779
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,799
worse position

1780
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,160
in some ways um

1781
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,880
well

1782
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,720
we're it it's

1783
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,319
the reason i would say so one i i would

1784
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,559
question the evidence that's cited for

1785
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,359
this

1786
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,520
um but the other is i think you probably

1787
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,760
need the

1788
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,400
at the very least something like to do

1789
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,160
temporarily deep

1790
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,920
generative modeling

1791
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,240
of a kind that would be able to give

1792
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,640
rise to an integrated world model

1793
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,839
it seems like the branson doesn't have

1794
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,880
what it takes i suspect you need the

1795
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,440
flamma coracle system with its ability

1796
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,319
to do

1797
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,079
this hierarchical sequence memory and

1798
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,319
its ability to

1799
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,680
capture this hierarchy of time scales

1800
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,599
all coupled

1801
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,720
to

1802
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,760
model

1803
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,559
your

1804
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,319
hierarchically

1805
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,079
your hierarchy or the dynamics unfolding

1806
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,119
heart rate and your engagement with the

1807
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,880
world you need a system that has those

1808
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,160
properties and i don't think the branson

1809
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,760
quite has what it takes

1810
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,640
um

1811
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,720
the you know basically for me to have

1812
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,559
consciousness i want to have

1813
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,480
i as i say an integrated world modeling

1814
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,319
theory i want

1815
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,720
the um an integrated role model that has

1816
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,799
coherence with respect to space time and

1817
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,039
cause and maybe also um agency some sort

1818
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,839
of basic autonomy as part of it and

1819
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,480
these are all necessary properties that

1820
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,039
potentially might be jointly sufficient

1821
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,640
but they're definitely necessary and so

1822
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,920
i don't think the branson can do all

1823
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,720
that

1824
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,599
um in terms of the data they cite um

1825
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,440
one would be um an

1826
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,760
ant phallic patients or um

1827
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,000
children without a developed verbal

1828
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,119
cortex

1829
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,839
and um or whether it's just not there

1830
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,520
and they're showing like this rich

1831
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,039
emotionality

1832
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,000
but

1833
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
my pushback would be um that

1834
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,799
that's

1835
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,799
that emotions they go all the way back

1836
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,799
um

1837
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,160
all life like that's like and like

1838
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,839
demacia's thinking and like the strange

1839
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,280
order of things

1840
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,359
um and the um

1841
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,960
2012 book i forgot what that one's

1842
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,880
called but it's

1843
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,680
this

1844
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,599
every single this it's these coherent

1845
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,920
changes and organismic modes

1846
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,960
that are corresponding to

1847
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,200
means of engaging with the world these

1848
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,520
classes of events and this is a state of

1849
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,400
basically action readiness over your

1850
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,319
system that allows you to adaptively

1851
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,359
couple and i think like this is what

1852
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,640
emotions are and so this is being shaped

1853
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,240
all the way back to a single cell and

1854
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,400
maybe we want to push consciousness that

1855
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,799
far down i personally wouldn't but the

1856
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,480
idea is i think you can have very rich

1857
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,760
unconscious emotions very rich affects

1858
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,839
and it should be organized

1859
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,520
organismically and so this will all be

1860
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,440
the level of the brainstem you'll see

1861
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,240
these things you'll see like for

1862
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,400
instance potentially laughter you'll see

1863
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,559
fear you'll see rage

1864
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,240
but i would argue you'll see in some

1865
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,920
ways homologs of these things going all

1866
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,079
the way back to bacteria bacteria going

1867
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,240
into like a sporulated form to protect

1868
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,200
itself

1869
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,039
that could be a kind of like fear thing

1870
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,520
or a bacteria releasing endotoxins that

1871
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,119
could be a kind of anger response or

1872
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,079
like extending a pilus to exchange

1873
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,920
circular chromosome little chromosome

1874
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,440
bits of 100 that could be a kind of

1875
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,960
bacterial lust

1876
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,319
i don't think there's anything it's like

1877
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,880
for these affects for the bacteria so i

1878
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,680
kind of push back and that basically the

1879
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,680
reflex these reflex arcs being engaged

1880
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,039
coherently

1881
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:41,839
for

1882
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:42,960
these things that are basically at the

1883
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,440
core of our experience was

1884
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,359
some of the most important part

1885
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,240
still

1886
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,799
um i think this can be done uh

1887
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,280
potentially just mechanically and like

1888
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,440
from like a kind of brooksian robotics

1889
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,480
emergency perspective uh where it's

1890
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,599
just the

1891
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,079
systems intelligence is in

1892
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,280
it's

1893
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,119
the what's available like the different

1894
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,240
modes its body can go into which will um

1895
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,599
allow for certain types of adaptive

1896
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,599
coupling yep it's the one more thing i

1897
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,599
would say would be um they also point to

1898
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,760
um

1899
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,319
the so like um like you got pancetta

1900
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,240
like you'll stimulate these areas and

1901
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,280
then they'll generate the emotion

1902
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,880
okay um

1903
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,039
but i think that might be the same story

1904
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,440
like the generation of affects we don't

1905
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,680
know right or rather okay so we know if

1906
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,119
you stimulate it

1907
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,520
in us

1908
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,960
so you can stimulate these areas and

1909
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,760
you'll generate the ocean but that that

1910
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,920
area itself is sufficient for it that we

1911
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
don't know i would suggest probably not

1912
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,359
and then for us if we experience the

1913
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,640
issue though is you have these looping

1914
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,000
effects you haven't cut it off it's

1915
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,240
circular causation so you stimulate

1916
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,079
these like brain stem nuclei or

1917
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,000
hypothalamic nuclei and then you

1918
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,520
generate the emotion well the cortex is

1919
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,200
still online for us

1920
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,839
and so that's

1921
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,760
uh i i would quite i basically i think

1922
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,680
the evidence is questionable for the the

1923
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,200
conscious brainstem

1924
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,119
even though i love everything else about

1925
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,720
someone's perspective

1926
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,960
i think we should move away from

1927
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,640
conscious brainstorms

1928
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,599
okay thank you yeah this um

1929
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,760
freud talks about

1930
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,000
different qualitatively different kinds

1931
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,240
of consciousness the consciousness

1932
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,799
that's in the brainstem and the cortical

1933
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
at least though i'm sorry i shouldn't

1934
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,400
say it that way the way psalms updates

1935
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,200
freud that there's certain consciousness

1936
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,920
that does seem to be confined to the

1937
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,599
brain stem and i know listening to his

1938
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:36,559
talks

1939
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,839
he he will say it's conscious and then

1940
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,079
in the next sentence it's unconscious

1941
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,200
and

1942
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,720
that

1943
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,359
that differentiation is really important

1944
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,520
it may be that if we were in the habit

1945
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,920
of talking about what i'm canning just

1946
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,880
now versus what we're witting

1947
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
it wouldn't be as confusing if we

1948
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,640
separate the body knowledge from the

1949
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,680
um

1950
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,839
visual knowledge or visual

1951
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,720
oral knowledge thank you yep thanks for

1952
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,880
that dave and um

1953
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,720
i'm not ready to say that consciousness

1954
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,319
isn't a helpful word but when you're

1955
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,559
talking about subtypes just brainstem

1956
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,359
function or the neural computational

1957
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,439
components of brainstem function in this

1958
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,960
or that state it's all of a sudden like

1959
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,799
it's like explained away

1960
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,238
and then also this question about the

1961
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:25,679
lesions and the measurements which is

1962
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,359
what is really important to us when

1963
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,679
we're thinking about this pragmatically

1964
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,000
it reminds me a lot of genetics where

1965
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,238
they'll take a gene even just going with

1966
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,238
the molecular dna concept of a gene so

1967
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,600
just saying they'll take a gene and

1968
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,279
they'll knock it out or they'll remove

1969
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,520
its function and then let's say blood

1970
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,880
pressure goes up when you delete the

1971
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,399
gene and they'll say oh well then this

1972
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,319
gene lowers blood pressure because it

1973
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,319
went up without it but that's actually

1974
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,759
not true to use out of your terminology

1975
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,520
the blood pressure is a phenotype that

1976
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,080
is like a self-organized harmonic mode

1977
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,920
and then when you change one of the

1978
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,279
nodes

1979
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,920
it's going to lead potentially to a

1980
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,600
if it's a buffered node then it's not

1981
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,960
going to change the mode at all so it'd

1982
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,960
be like a phenotypically silent mutation

1983
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,120
or it could be like a key linchpin just

1984
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,719
like the you know epigenetic landscape

1985
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,640
behind me um it changed one of these

1986
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,920
guys that are key

1987
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,000
and then it changes the self-organizing

1988
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,799
mode and so just like you said a brain

1989
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,880
region when you lesion it if it removes

1990
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,399
some trait that doesn't mean the trait

1991
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,359
was in that region it's actually a total

1992
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,279
integrated network and then you change

1993
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,600
the network or the system's phenotype

1994
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,920
when you change the system so i'm always

1995
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,319
extremely skeptical of well this removal

1996
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,839
of this brain region remove this trait

1997
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,520
so it's in there it's like actually you

1998
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,198
could almost say it isn't in there

1999
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,560
because the system was able to

2000
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,279
reorganize without it and so it's just

2001
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,439
it's it's almost like the opposite of

2002
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,040
what people think is being shown with

2003
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,560
lesion experiments it's being shown that

2004
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,479
the system has capacity

2005
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,640
that is modified by key elements like if

2006
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,400
you inject ketamine you know into your

2007
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,920
wrist there's going to be a different

2008
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,920
phenotype than if it goes into some

2009
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,760
brain region like there's brain regions

2010
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,239
where a different drug being dripped on

2011
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,920
is going to lead to different phenotypic

2012
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,880
changes so that's actually not simply

2013
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,400
evidence that the brain is the locus of

2014
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,560
consciousness it's just saying yeah

2015
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,320
there's you know your elbow is a pivotal

2016
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,960
spot for the movement of your arm and

2017
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,800
there's brain regions that

2018
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,679
play critical message passing roles and

2019
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,520
neural functional roles

2020
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,159
but that doesn't uniquely identify this

2021
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,280
sort of object reductionist um or

2022
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,280
regional perspective

2023
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,400
um this is fun stuff i think we can um

2024
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,199
let's

2025
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,360
um adam yeah go for it yeah yeah

2026
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,599
um

2027
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,560
i guess in terms of um things like

2028
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,360
uh

2029
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,199
virtual machines

2030
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,360
and what what's

2031
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,520
types of systems so i'm like kind of

2032
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,239
pushing back on brainstorms but i'm also

2033
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,880
um in some ways broader i guess than

2034
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,120
like um maybe potentially wandering

2035
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
carl's perspective and that i'm actually

2036
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,280
really happy with consciousness

2037
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,800
being supported by a virtual machine in

2038
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,159
fact i think you might want to even

2039
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,520
think about it as a kind of virtual

2040
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,640
machine

2041
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,840
um

2042
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,199
and

2043
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,400
for me

2044
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
um though part of what i want to have

2045
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,040
happen it's not just this potentially

2046
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,520
the ability to have um

2047
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,280
you know a hierarchy

2048
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,360
of representation

2049
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,199
with like synchronous dynamics

2050
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,520
facilitating the message passing but

2051
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,920
what i'm going to want is for basically

2052
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,120
these estimates of the organisms

2053
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,280
or the the system's engagement with the

2054
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,159
world

2055
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,760
to be generated

2056
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,679
on a time scale

2057
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,560
that would allow it to both inform and

2058
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,800
be informed by evolving action

2059
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,719
perception cycles

2060
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,840
and where basically the role for me of

2061
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,159
this basic phenomena awareness would be

2062
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,040
a series of estimates who through their

2063
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,719
basically

2064
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,080
high degree of coherence can also exert

2065
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,199
um

2066
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,280
powerful control energy they end up

2067
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,719
constituting this center um

2068
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:03,760
slow

2069
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,920
synergetic attracting manifold that can

2070
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,920
enslave the rest of the system to

2071
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,800
degrees and influence its its dynamics

2072
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,440
basically influencing action selection

2073
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,880
series of estimates that can influence

2074
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,320
action selection and be updated

2075
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,640
via your engagement

2076
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,960
so this doesn't necessarily need to be a

2077
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,040
brain but for me i want that i want

2078
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,679
basically a rich enough estimate of the

2079
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,199
global state

2080
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,360
of the system and i want these estimates

2081
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,960
to be

2082
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,600
occur on a time scale where they can

2083
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,199
significantly

2084
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,960
enough that there's a good amount of

2085
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,640
grip enough that you can actually do

2086
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,880
active inference both in form and be

2087
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
informed by

2088
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,400
the engagement i want one more thing

2089
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,480
potentially or maybe two more

2090
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,199
um which would be um i would want uh

2091
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,239
a

2092
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,559
um

2093
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,760
[Music]

2094
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,400
a large enough network

2095
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,600
that you can get some sort of

2096
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,280
non-equilibrium steady state or

2097
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,800
self-organizing harmonic mode among some

2098
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,120
aspect of it some subset of it

2099
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,920
um

2100
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,880
which

2101
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,320
would

2102
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,239
where the closure would be achieved

2103
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,239
within this system

2104
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:17,760
that there that you could describe such

2105
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,640
a object such a harmonic or such a nest

2106
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,760
density

2107
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,560
and

2108
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,560
i think what you might potentially need

2109
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,640
is a big enough system

2110
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,520
that

2111
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,400
you're can get almost like an inner loop

2112
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,920
or that when you're forming this

2113
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,679
metastable state it's not immediately

2114
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,920
disrupted by the engagements with the

2115
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,800
world

2116
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,560
via the sensory states and so i want to

2117
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,760
be big enough

2118
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,120
that there's this

2119
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,600
it can form these internal

2120
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,520
complexes can i tie this to a question

2121
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,280
in the chat because i think it's great

2122
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,760
okay cambridge breaths asks

2123
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,400
carl fristen was asked if hurricanes

2124
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,239
have a markov blanket

2125
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,320
he said reluctantly no

2126
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,520
what would that say about markov

2127
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,040
blankets in general and is there any

2128
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,199
mathematical way to attribute markov

2129
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,199
blanket to a hurricane so i'm going to

2130
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,120
put up the image where we have the

2131
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,360
blanket states whether it's a markov or

2132
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,040
a first in blanket and the internal

2133
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,800
states with a generative model but what

2134
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,080
you just said there about the

2135
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,800
persistence through time of an inner

2136
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,760
loop

2137
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,199
how would you relate that to this

2138
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,360
question about the hurricane and about

2139
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,199
what systems like is a hurricane

2140
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:24,239
conscious

2141
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,400
um it has little inner loops doesn't it

2142
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,960
little turbulent eddies but what is it

2143
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,320
about the sort of like sustained memory

2144
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,080
and this inner looping

2145
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,400
where does that come into play and

2146
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,159
is that a way almost to go about

2147
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,480
identifying which systems

2148
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,360
hint might be able to be measured as

2149
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,040
conscious because they'll have an

2150
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,800
internal dynamics

2151
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,800
that um are complex

2152
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,840
no idea especially with the hurricane

2153
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,640
but

2154
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,800
although a thought that i've been like

2155
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,719
trying to think into recently

2156
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,000
is

2157
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,960
um

2158
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,000
i'm wondering whether this inner loop

2159
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,840
might actually be important

2160
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,239
so maybe we can only define a markov

2161
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,880
blank a fristen blanket mark all blanket

2162
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,400
when you have

2163
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,080
this sort of

2164
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,320
separability and maybe only for these

2165
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,080
like inner loop processes if you're not

2166
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,840
basically immediately being disrupted

2167
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,600
by the engagement where you can't draw

2168
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,960
the boundaries just like immediately

2169
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,239
effaced

2170
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,080
um and that would still you could still

2171
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,280
do an inference maybe they'll be kind of

2172
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,960
like i don't know if it'd be amortized

2173
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,000
influence but it'll be you could still

2174
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,679
do inference and coupling but it

2175
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,480
wouldn't be this uh

2176
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,520
uh

2177
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,880
you you wouldn't have these series of

2178
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,719
estimates but the

2179
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,960
thing i'm wondering actually is whether

2180
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,480
in some ways

2181
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,159
the solution to the hard problem and the

2182
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,840
solution to what is life

2183
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,760
along the lines of markovian modernism

2184
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,719
even though

2185
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,880
uh it might be one and the same

2186
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,640
and that like the boundary of life

2187
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,640
non-life the boundary of conscious

2188
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,920
non-conscious

2189
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,440
what actually makes for this

2190
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,719
adaptiveness is to have estimates which

2191
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,280
can evolve slightly independently

2192
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,159
from

2193
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,000
the world such that you can do things

2194
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,760
like counterfactuals

2195
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,840
in terms of your modeling so you can get

2196
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,400
this sort of um

2197
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,880
sussing out of different possibilities

2198
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,080
and then using this as a means of

2199
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,640
surfing your uncertainty your engagement

2200
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,920
now i wouldn't want to go as far as to

2201
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,880
say that all life is conscious i'm not

2202
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,440
personally of that view like you can

2203
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,040
make a case for it because i want the

2204
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,320
additional coherence properties i don't

2205
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,080
think all life has but this idea though

2206
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,320
that the boundary problem of life and

2207
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,640
non-life of unconscious information

2208
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,640
processing or unconscious perception

2209
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,719
conscious perception it might be exactly

2210
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,400
the same issue

2211
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,159
let's connect it let's connect it to

2212
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,600
what the paper says because i think this

2213
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,880
is really

2214
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,760
what we're on the brink of so this is

2215
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,600
quotations from the paper this is about

2216
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,400
where

2217
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,679
free energy principle and active

2218
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,440
inference is going to step into some of

2219
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,440
these very challenging perennial

2220
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,120
questions like what is consciousness how

2221
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,280
do we measure it who gets to have it so

2222
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,760
the first summary point of wanja and

2223
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,760
carl was according to free energy

2224
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,080
principle we need to be thinking about

2225
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,320
neurodynamics not just neural states so

2226
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,840
i think that's very related to what

2227
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,520
we've been talking about not just the

2228
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,520
states like oh well this neuron has this

2229
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,880
action potential and this one's doing

2230
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,920
that we need to think about the

2231
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,880
trajectory through time so short clean

2232
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,800
point and the third point is also a

2233
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,719
short clean point it's more of like a

2234
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,280
literature claim which is that other

2235
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,600
people's models were generalizing above

2236
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,360
them okay so the first and the third

2237
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,760
point i think are um

2238
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,280
short and sweet

2239
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,880
let's really go into the second point

2240
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,400
because it relates to

2241
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,760
what's the difference between being

2242
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,640
conscious and simulating consciousness

2243
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,760
people can have different opinions on

2244
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,960
this but this is where the authors are

2245
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,640
taking it and then what kind of

2246
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,719
biological or non-biological systems

2247
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,679
might have or be conscious so hurricane

2248
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,360
how about a pilot in the hurricane what

2249
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,679
if the hurry yeah so what do they

2250
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,440
actually say here according to the free

2251
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,040
energy principle there's a relevant

2252
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,239
distinction to be made between the

2253
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,320
probabilities of the neural states

2254
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,080
um or the trajectories and the

2255
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,560
probabilities they encode so i i think i

2256
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,679
had to read this a bunch of times

2257
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,080
because they sound so familiar but it's

2258
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,159
basically saying there's the probability

2259
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,640
of the neural state itself

2260
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,520
um which is like the probability of the

2261
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,080
brain is in that exact stance which is

2262
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,640
actually never going to return to

2263
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,120
and the probabilities that the brain is

2264
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,560
encoding

2265
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,199
so um for example if the brain is

2266
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,719
involved in a

2267
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,719
decision making task

2268
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,000
there's the probability of the

2269
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,560
microstates the brain which you can go

2270
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,320
reduce all the way down and it's never

2271
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,880
going to replicate those microstates so

2272
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,400
instead of focusing on the probability

2273
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,080
of the states or even the probabilities

2274
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,320
of the trajectories which are always

2275
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,560
going to be vanishingly zero

2276
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,840
we can think about what are the

2277
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,640
probabilities encoded by those states

2278
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,960
like the action readiness is this person

2279
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,840
in a global dynamic state where they're

2280
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,480
action ready to move like they're awake

2281
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,320
or they're not action ready so they're

2282
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,000
like asleep

2283
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,640
how are we going to do this

2284
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,400
subtle shift from thinking about the

2285
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,960
probabilities of states and trajectories

2286
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,440
versus the probabilities encoded by

2287
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,239
states and trajectories well this is

2288
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,080
where they introduce the information

2289
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,280
geometry

2290
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,920
and they call this partitioning between

2291
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,120
the probability of the state and the

2292
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,760
probability encoded by the state as

2293
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,480
intrinsic versus extrinsic information

2294
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,679
geometry

2295
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,760
so in line with this distinction neural

2296
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,880
dynamics

2297
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,719
are movements on this intrinsic

2298
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,719
statistical manifold

2299
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,360
and then the computational component

2300
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,880
what the observer

2301
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,280
is modeling them as what's the shortest

2302
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,159
algorithm that generates that behavior

2303
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,480
that is movement on the extrinsic

2304
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,679
manifold

2305
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,239
and so this relates to what is being

2306
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,320
conscious versus simulating it

2307
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,280
for

2308
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,199
the um hurricane

2309
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,480
let's just say

2310
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,719
those two manifolds are actually

2311
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,080
mapped like there's no hidden states the

2312
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,590
microstates and the macro states are um

2313
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:15,920
[Music]

2314
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,120
they're

2315
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,520
they're they're one and the same

2316
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,159
whereas when you have systems that are

2317
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,080
engaged in these very

2318
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,560
vanishingly rare micro states but then

2319
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,960
they converge upon reproducible

2320
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,719
algorithmic or computational or

2321
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,880
behavioral features

2322
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,280
that partitioning can tell us something

2323
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,960
if there's a system where those are one

2324
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,320
in the same like it's a double pendulum

2325
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,239
and you're curious about its behavior it

2326
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,920
still could be chaotic but there's no

2327
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,639
like hidden interactors whereas there's

2328
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,320
other systems where computationally we

2329
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,360
have to approach them in a really

2330
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,639
different way i'm not sure if that's

2331
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,440
correct but that's kind of what we tried

2332
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,800
to um

2333
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,480
read about in this paper and explore

2334
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,400
where is the intrinsic and extrinsic

2335
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,719
concepts coming into play

2336
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,960
and how do we

2337
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,480
how do we take all these interesting

2338
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,760
things that are happening here and

2339
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,000
move towards a definition or some sort

2340
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,280
of um

2341
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,880
operationalization adam

2342
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,800
yep go for it

2343
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,159
i don't know

2344
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,040
but

2345
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,080
um

2346
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:24,960
but

2347
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,600
that won't stop me um

2348
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,679
so

2349
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,000
i guess

2350
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,199
so as i was saying before i think

2351
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,560
actually we might want to think of

2352
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,080
consciousness

2353
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,239
as a kind of virtual machine

2354
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,679
and i think especially once we get to

2355
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:41,520
this sort of generative passages and

2356
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,760
these richer senses of consciousness i

2357
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,960
think we're definitely dealing with a

2358
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,040
virtual machine in these cases

2359
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,920
um

2360
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,960
but

2361
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,199
in terms of this um this maybe this

2362
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,920
place where it's this one-to-one

2363
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,920
mapping between the extrinsic and

2364
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,600
intrinsic

2365
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,440
manifolds is this one-to-one mapping of

2366
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,360
information geometries

2367
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,560
um

2368
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,159
i guess at least within

2369
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,120
um

2370
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,880
kind of come back to brains

2371
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,000
i'm

2372
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,760
so for instance i focus on um

2373
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,880
alpha frequencies because these are

2374
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,560
though basically if you look at like the

2375
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,120
scope of what could be synchronized it's

2376
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,719
this big swaths of posterior cortices

2377
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,560
um so about eight to twelve times a

2378
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,239
second you can generate these metastable

2379
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:29,040
states where the neurons are all um

2380
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,719
basically

2381
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,600
more aligned in their activity and so um

2382
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
i think pascal freeze we call this

2383
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,199
communication through coherence there

2384
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,400
you can actually

2385
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,159
get integration and message passing and

2386
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,719
so i'm claiming that this is entailing

2387
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:43,920
basically

2388
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,480
some joint marginal um

2389
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,280
of

2390
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,639
the sensorium

2391
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,719
the engagement with the world um or

2392
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,280
potentially a maximum a posterior or a

2393
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,679
estimate thereof i don't know which

2394
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,480
um

2395
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,360
but

2396
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,199
the

2397
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,000
and part of the relation though um is

2398
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,800
the

2399
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,920
um

2400
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,520
i'm thinking that this this would be

2401
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,600
like maybe the first inner loop type

2402
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,600
process that you might get

2403
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,639
and

2404
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,639
in terms of its relation to the coupling

2405
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:13,760
of the world

2406
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,679
um it might have certain special

2407
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,040
properties

2408
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,840
in terms of

2409
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,360
um so i have this kind of weird idea

2410
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,880
that by the time you get

2411
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,520
to um like the pecunius i mentioned

2412
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,560
these poster medial cortices um

2413
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,159
that you're going to get these ensemble

2414
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,239
activity of

2415
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,639
neural ensembles normal populations

2416
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,679
that would have a kind of chronotopic or

2417
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,480
um

2418
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,840
consistent

2419
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,800
time-varying relationship of the

2420
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,440
neuronal ensembles evolving and what's

2421
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,520
happening in the world on the organismic

2422
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,560
scale

2423
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,800
um so it would be like if you know i'm

2424
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,560
moving my hand like this it's going

2425
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,000
below my above my eyes and there might

2426
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,159
be some mapping now into the ensemble

2427
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,320
activity which is then changing

2428
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,800
roughly at that time scale and you can

2429
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,360
detect this um

2430
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,440
what it would partially do to bring it

2431
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,760
together um into this like cartesian

2432
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,360
theateresque thing

2433
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,159
would be is this would um

2434
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,719
i i'm i suspect it's potentially not

2435
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,120
even um there's some sort of not just

2436
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,560
chronotopic in terms of like a

2437
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
correspondence of time there might even

2438
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,920
be kind of

2439
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,199
quasi-topographic euclidean properties

2440
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,280
of it in terms of the ability of for

2441
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,920
instance what's in the mind's eye to

2442
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,760
actually couple the oculomotor system

2443
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,679
which itself is going to have a kind of

2444
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,679
coherent topography

2445
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,679
um but

2446
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,360
i guess the idea is that

2447
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,400
um

2448
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,638
you're gonna

2449
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,280
the idea would be that the

2450
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:51,600
inner

2451
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,760
that

2452
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,199
these

2453
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,159
so i'm basically thinking of

2454
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,239
consciousness as discrete updating of

2455
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,239
the generative model

2456
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,920
which

2457
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,679
at eight to twelve times a second in

2458
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,679
terms of phenomenal consciousness

2459
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:06,719
and that

2460
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,000
these discrete updates if you look at

2461
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,679
them they're actually inner they're

2462
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,600
divorced and so

2463
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,520
there's there's not a direct mapping by

2464
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,880
the time that these functional cycles

2465
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,400
achieve closure

2466
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,480
and so i don't know if this

2467
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,280
is consistent or not with or uh with

2468
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,440
london carl's uh

2469
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,560
argument

2470
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,040
so the 8 to 12 part seems like that's an

2471
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,440
implementation specific detail right

2472
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,040
because that's related to r

2473
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,480
so it could be totally important for us

2474
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,159
but it may not be a general feature

2475
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,400
right now let's look at this

2476
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,400
equation set

2477
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,280
um

2478
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,880
we're thinking about this intrinsic

2479
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,080
extrinsic information approach and it's

2480
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,480
saying it's saying the free energy of

2481
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,719
the paulus of the now it's a little

2482
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,400
confusing because pi is used to mean

2483
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,040
policy in almost all situations but here

2484
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,040
i think pi is actually comprising

2485
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,040
blanket states and internal states so

2486
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,520
it's a slightly different pi variable we

2487
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,520
could get that clarified but the point

2488
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,000
is that um the system

2489
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,760
is going to be acting as if it's

2490
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,040
minimizing the difference between

2491
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,840
accuracy and complexity now in the case

2492
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,760
of let's call it a one-to-one system

2493
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,600
like whether it's a double pendulum

2494
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,440
which is a chaotic system it's simple

2495
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,120
but it's chaotic or it's a hurricane

2496
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,600
with turbulence and reynolds numbers

2497
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,880
if it's a one-to-one system it's not

2498
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,480
acting as if it's

2499
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,000
co-optimizing this trade-off of accuracy

2500
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and complexity even if you said well the

2501
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,440
hurricane is like a model of its

2502
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,199
environment it's just it's actually it's

2503
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,800
a perfect model it's not minimizing the

2504
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,719
complexity at all

2505
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:37,520
just

2506
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,840
not making an absolute claim just saying

2507
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,199
on the other hand

2508
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,639
if you take the intentional stance and

2509
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,639
you're thinking about an agent and that

2510
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,440
agent is acting as if

2511
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,679
it is minimizing the difference between

2512
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,199
uh

2513
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,199
accuracy and complexity

2514
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,719
that means that its extrinsic

2515
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:59,600
information manifold is rich according

2516
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,239
to this lz complexity metric

2517
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,400
so when they're the same there's no

2518
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,120
delta it just is that system so it's

2519
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,480
almost like when you have a total state

2520
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,960
space representation and the mapping

2521
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,560
there's actually not that much more you

2522
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,760
need to express you say well yeah the

2523
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
chatbot said i'm conscious and i love

2524
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,920
the beatles but that's because that's

2525
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,080
what was preloaded so when you have the

2526
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,679
full and that's actually why the neural

2527
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:22,880
reductionist

2528
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
direction i believe is ultimately

2529
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,960
fallacious because let's just say you

2530
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,800
had every atom in the brain then what

2531
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,719
are we conscious or not but people are

2532
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,239
acting like just a few more measurements

2533
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,639
or a couple more eegs now

2534
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,239
on the other hand when we think about

2535
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,159
separating the internal and the external

2536
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,280
information geometry if we find systems

2537
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,320
that have a big delta they're acting

2538
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,719
really really as if they're minimizing

2539
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,800
accuracy minus complexity

2540
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,120
and that extrinsic information manifold

2541
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,800
we could say whether it is lz or another

2542
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,639
type of complexity but that

2543
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,600
extrinsic manifold is complex

2544
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,440
like a human might get a tweet every

2545
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,280
hour and then engage in some like super

2546
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,400
interesting behavior that would be a big

2547
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,600
divergence

2548
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,760
between the intrinsic and the extrinsic

2549
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,960
manifold

2550
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,280
and the extrinsic behavior

2551
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,199
would be difficult to compress with

2552
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,960
respect to the inputs

2553
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,199
so that might lend it a higher

2554
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,199
complexity so there's sort of two things

2555
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,000
there's um how much does it look like

2556
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,080
it's minimizing its free energy

2557
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,400
according to this structure

2558
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,080
and then

2559
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,120
is the extrinsic information manifold

2560
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,880
complex and then what are the measures

2561
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,040
of complexity

2562
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,560
i know that's

2563
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,080
a bunch of random stuff i'm trying to

2564
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,120
trace the argument of the paper because

2565
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,040
these might be the kinds of measurements

2566
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,120
or comparators even relative

2567
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,719
measurements or ratios that help us

2568
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,920
understand um adam

2569
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,280
hmm

2570
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,440
so

2571
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,159
i guess the

2572
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,120
it's the first speak to like you get

2573
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,080
what you're saying about like the

2574
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,000
generalization and to not get like too

2575
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,320
bogged down by the specifics of how it

2576
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,080
might be realized within like for

2577
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,920
instance the mammalian nervous system i

2578
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,120
think that's really important in that

2579
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,080
would

2580
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,320
don't want to do that um

2581
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,840
the

2582
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,800
i think some of the principles um would

2583
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,360
general like they would generalize

2584
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,280
um and so

2585
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,320
for me the um

2586
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,719
i'm wondering whether actually in terms

2587
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,040
of this

2588
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,360
closure with respect to action

2589
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,199
perception cycles

2590
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:42,320
but actually

2591
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,360
this is potentially uh double

2592
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,440
the frequency or um

2593
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,480
uh

2594
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,040
it's you're nesting actually two quail

2595
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,360
states within

2596
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,239
a

2597
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,760
broader

2598
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,480
envelope a functional cycle that closed

2599
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,600
that closes on a slower time scale

2600
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,960
um and so for the brain this would be

2601
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,159
something like theta potentially

2602
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,679
orchestrated by something like the

2603
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,600
campbell system which might be doing

2604
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,239
this kind of comparator operation as a

2605
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,159
kind of like contrastive energy based

2606
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,840
learning but this would be like a more

2607
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,679
general thing what you might need to be

2608
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,040
doing is

2609
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,280
comparing things

2610
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,480
and um

2611
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:27,040
like for the organism to uh

2612
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,040
adaptively navigate the world and

2613
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,719
generate a causal model

2614
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,639
um

2615
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,840
it might be um

2616
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,600
that you have this more extended

2617
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,880
generative passage level unfolding and

2618
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,840
then within there you're forming other

2619
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,639
nest densities or harmonics at the other

2620
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,400
time skills that you can then use these

2621
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,320
as objects which you then compare

2622
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,760
between and put in relation to each

2623
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,520
other and so any system

2624
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,960
um i'm thinking you would have like

2625
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,840
potentially nested markov blankets where

2626
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,080
some of them would correspond to like

2627
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,560
the system as a whole and its engagement

2628
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,320
with the world where this is its own

2629
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,880
best model and it's just this it's just

2630
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,800
the whole it's a perfect mapping

2631
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:11,520
with

2632
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,400
um

2633
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,679
like it's the

2634
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,239
the hurricane or the whirlpool example

2635
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,560
but then uh

2636
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,840
you're then

2637
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,600
getting

2638
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,040
basically on as you move inwards or

2639
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,000
outwards

2640
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,840
you're getting these other

2641
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,440
nest densities forming on different time

2642
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,000
scales which are then encompassing

2643
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,520
their markov blankets encompass the

2644
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,760
other ones and some of these i think we

2645
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,120
really should be thinking of these like

2646
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,120
in terms of virtual machines you can't

2647
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,360
point to at any given point and say aha

2648
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,520
there you are and it might actually

2649
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,920
extend not even within the arctic

2650
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,639
not within the system it would be

2651
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,400
within in between it would be relational

2652
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,840
out into the world

2653
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,719
um

2654
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,639
and

2655
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,080
i'm personally suspecting that there's

2656
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,639
this like within like this onion of

2657
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,320
nested markov blankets some of them call

2658
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,760
it corresponding

2659
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,560
to

2660
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,520
different

2661
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,679
uh uh some of them corresponding virtual

2662
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,840
machines some of them corresponding to

2663
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,760
the world as its own best model or the

2664
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,360
world as model um uh that there might be

2665
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,280
a point where it's like aha there there

2666
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,360
you are i'm personally thinking

2667
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,520
this is for the mammalian brain it's at

2668
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,480
the alpha frequency but it it would just

2669
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,560
be at that and so

2670
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,560
i guess the one more thing would be um

2671
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,520
in terms of the difference between

2672
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,520
simulation and emulation

2673
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,199
i actually think in in the figure that

2674
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,320
wandra showed where he had the um

2675
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,560
description of the von neumann

2676
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,080
architecture and then you had this

2677
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,920
memory register with the terms from

2678
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,120
active inference

2679
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,800
um

2680
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,679
i think that i i think that mixed

2681
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,280
scientology

2682
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,120
um

2683
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,040
is revealing and

2684
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,960
it could potentially

2685
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,199
um mislead

2686
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,120
and that i'm wondering whether by the

2687
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,800
time we've committed ourselves to having

2688
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,120
these kinds of active sensory and

2689
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,800
blanket states that you can

2690
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,600
put into that memory register of the von

2691
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,040
neumann architecture

2692
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,120
we actually ought to be core screening

2693
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,960
differently and we shouldn't be thinking

2694
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,639
of the vinyl in architecture anymore

2695
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:13,840
it's actually

2696
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,280
um

2697
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,880
i don't i don't know if you can actually

2698
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,480
do brilliant analysis on that i think

2699
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,040
it's like it might break the rules of

2700
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,560
causal inference

2701
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,159
i totally agree with that i think

2702
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,400
whether it's lambda calculus or some

2703
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,880
other algorithmic description

2704
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,360
the current implementations of computers

2705
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,920
are only one way and so if we mistake

2706
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,520
the map for the territory or the

2707
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,440
specific for the general then we're

2708
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,040
going to be like well it's the ram and

2709
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,960
then this channel you know if you legion

2710
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,719
the ram it doesn't have short-term

2711
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,560
memory doesn't that sound like these

2712
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,560
computationalist reductionist

2713
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,480
researchers because they are working um

2714
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,199
sort of not clearly whether it's general

2715
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,600
specific brain or computer and then the

2716
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,080
quote that that reminded me of it's by

2717
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,360
john muir the uh californian forest

2718
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,199
lover he wrote

2719
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,520
i only went out for a walk and finally

2720
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,920
concluded to stay out till sundown for

2721
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,800
going out i found was really going in

2722
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,719
so it's like i went out for a walk it's

2723
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,960
action planning and finally concluded to

2724
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,440
stay out till sundown deep temporal

2725
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,560
inference

2726
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,880
for going out i was really going in

2727
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,040
because when he was in the niche

2728
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,120
acting and inferring

2729
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,320
he was

2730
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,639
being himself and so it really captures

2731
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,120
like a lot of these dimensions

2732
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,960
that we're

2733
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,719
getting at and then also i'll raise a

2734
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,800
question from um from cambridge breath

2735
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,719
in the chat and it's related to what you

2736
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,719
said about the nested systems adam

2737
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,159
cambridge writes

2738
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,639
can we have a non-metacognitive

2739
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,360
conscious entity so to speak or our

2740
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,280
consciousness and metacognition

2741
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,880
inseparable

2742
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,679
so we're we've used this idea of like

2743
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,920
self-reflexive autopoetic autonomic it's

2744
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,679
come up a ton of times

2745
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,760
are those one and the same to be aware

2746
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,840
conscious and recursive

2747
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,239
or might there be some differentiating

2748
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,040
wedge somewhere

2749
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,840
[Music]

2750
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,400
i mean um

2751
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,760
i guess it depends like what we mean by

2752
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,280
metacognition so if we're talking about

2753
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,280
a very minimal metacognition i think

2754
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,119
would be necessary

2755
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,880
in terms of um

2756
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,159
in a way i think you might be able to

2757
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,080
think of like precision weighting as a

2758
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,480
kind of minimal metacognition

2759
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,360
and um and even like on what levels are

2760
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,960
you doing your precision weighting but

2761
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,639
this might be essential because you

2762
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,800
can't do good inference

2763
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,880
uh without it like

2764
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,119
for it to be based it's this combination

2765
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,560
of precision weighted probabilities

2766
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,159
that's what gives it its power is

2767
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,199
weighing things by their relative

2768
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,960
reliability or part of what does that

2769
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,239
like the ability to like iteratively

2770
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:47,280
refine

2771
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,320
um by leveraging your priors but

2772
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,119
the

2773
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,560
and so we're going to need at least

2774
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,679
precision waiting to have probably any

2775
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,440
kind of coherent world modeling whether

2776
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,800
it's exactly bayesian or not um you know

2777
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,679
but

2778
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,440
it's got to be bayesian-ish enough i

2779
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,320
think in order for there to be coherence

2780
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
um you need to be able to take the

2781
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,880
reliability of information and so

2782
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,639
these precision estimations could be for

2783
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,960
instance entailed

2784
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,960
on many different levels they might be

2785
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,000
for instance

2786
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,520
entailed

2787
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,000
mammalian so they might be just emerging

2788
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,239
and distributed um through this like

2789
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,639
game of free energy minimization taking

2790
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:27,920
place among all these distributed

2791
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,600
coupling elements but there might even

2792
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,119
be also like centralized control

2793
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,199
structures which help to give you

2794
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,040
additional levels of precision weighting

2795
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,480
things like

2796
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,880
singular cortices potentially or um the

2797
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,600
pulvinar and like um uh

2798
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,679
that might the thalamus part of what

2799
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,679
might make that so essential for humans

2800
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,679
would be its persituating and you might

2801
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,840
see in a variety of systems there might

2802
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,639
be like even like within a cell i don't

2803
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,639
know but there could be like you need

2804
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:55,679
some sort of like centralized

2805
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,760
integration structures for this more

2806
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,360
global precision waiting to occur

2807
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,400
not sure

2808
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,199
but

2809
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,520
in terms of like

2810
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:05,840
just metacognition

2811
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,679
bring it to the frist in

2812
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,639
formalisms or formulisms like what

2813
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,600
what would you say that idea connects to

2814
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,280
when we're thinking about

2815
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,560
how it was

2816
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,119
formulated in the paper

2817
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,080
you know to grow

2818
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,480
to ground the conversation for listeners

2819
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,480
and for ourselves like when we when we

2820
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,400
ground it in the formalisms then we can

2821
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,920
say well i don't think the formalism is

2822
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,520
trying to describe the right thing or i

2823
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,119
don't think it correctly describes what

2824
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,679
we're agreed upon is the correct thing

2825
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:36,800
um

2826
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,360
and a lot of times it's easy to invoke

2827
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,760
these formal frameworks but then never

2828
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,080
clarify what our mapping is between like

2829
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,360
okay there's a kinetic a path

2830
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,199
independent and a path dependent term

2831
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,880
sounds like kind of relevant but then

2832
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,239
i'm not exactly sure that it's going to

2833
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:52,480
transmute into qualia and that's like

2834
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,239
that gap that we want to be sort of

2835
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:57,280
hammering at again and again

2836
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,000
i mean

2837
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
in terms of actually thoroughgoingly

2838
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,080
connecting back to the formalism uh you

2839
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,679
got the wrong guy

2840
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,920
but um

2841
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,000
and

2842
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
i i think though this would be at least

2843
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
i think actually consider consistent

2844
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,239
with like mark some's perspective also

2845
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,719
for him uh consciousness is inherently

2846
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,320
metacognitive and he is relating it to

2847
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,920
precision waiting but in terms of

2848
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,480
exactly with this more um in terms of

2849
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,040
markovian modelism that i don't know um

2850
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,960
how to describe that well i guess i had

2851
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,480
one more thing in terms of like the way

2852
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,040
i'm thinking about it which would be um

2853
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,880
i personally uh

2854
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,639
think that um

2855
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,719
you can have like in contrast to like a

2856
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,800
higher order thought type theory

2857
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,239
that you actually so there's some

2858
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,760
theories which for instance try to

2859
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,000
collapse these different senses of

2860
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,360
consciousness and they would reject for

2861
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,040
instance potentially the difference

2862
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,239
between phenomenal and access

2863
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,719
consciousness or and they would say you

2864
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,920
do need

2865
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,000
this um

2866
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,119
uh

2867
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,719
you you do need these high-level

2868
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,719
features for there to be anything at all

2869
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,639
that um

2870
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:03,520
and

2871
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,000
i personally um if it depends on the

2872
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,040
richness of what we mean by

2873
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,639
metacognition so if we're saying

2874
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,639
precision waiting then i say yes

2875
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,520
if we're saying though things like um

2876
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,360
autonoesis or like reflective

2877
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,679
self-consciousness then i say probably

2878
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:19,280
not we you don't need that i think there

2879
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,440
could be something that it's like and

2880
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,920
you could be generating qualia and these

2881
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,199
could just

2882
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,639
pop up there was something that it's

2883
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,800
like as they were being as they were

2884
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,920
emerging

2885
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,119
and then

2886
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,280
they go away as soon as they were there

2887
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,440
and you weren't able to reflect on them

2888
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:38,560
you weren't able to have um to compare

2889
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,280
them potentially and you even less so

2890
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,600
we're able to contextualize them with

2891
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,360
relation to yourself and time in a rich

2892
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,840
sense i think that's quite possible

2893
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,199
um

2894
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:50,560
so i don't think

2895
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,320
you need like the more rich kinds of

2896
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,040
metacognition to have consciousness in

2897
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,440
terms of the appearance of the world

2898
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,480
for the appearance of the world to be

2899
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,320
like our appearance of the world than

2900
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,920
you do but in terms of just the

2901
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,239
appearance of any kind of world any kind

2902
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,679
of what it is like this or what it feels

2903
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,840
like this i don't think you you need

2904
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,119
that

2905
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,360
i i really love that connection it's

2906
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,520
like there's the what it's

2907
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,280
to be like whatever it is

2908
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,040
but then the way that we actually

2909
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,719
experience or any given individual

2910
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,119
experiences it is so cultural it can

2911
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,480
really never be

2912
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,320
disentangled for example people will

2913
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,000
tell you just yeah there's x y z it's

2914
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,920
three axes and they're orthogonal at 90

2915
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,800
degrees

2916
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,239
except if you grew up studying

2917
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,719
synergetics and buckminster fuller then

2918
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,639
there's four spatial dimensions and the

2919
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,199
orthogonal angles are 60 degrees so is

2920
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,960
it really a fact of the world that it's

2921
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,639
xyz or is that just something that's

2922
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,960
culturally reified in the way people

2923
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,239
talk about the world and how they

2924
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,560
measure and how they communicate and so

2925
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,320
it's always like this question about

2926
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
what are the general attributes but you

2927
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,199
never

2928
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,080
observe the the genus the general you

2929
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,719
always observe the species the specific

2930
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,360
and so we are in a little bit of a

2931
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,199
triple bind because we don't know what

2932
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:03,040
consciousness is how to measure it or

2933
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,600
what the observables are per se

2934
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,159
and it's sort of like it's a catch 33

2935
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,480
you have to solve them all in one

2936
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,679
approach

2937
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:13,280
because if you're observing something

2938
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,719
and you're like oh it's all about the

2939
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,800
eeg and you're going way down the rabbit

2940
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,119
hole with a four-year transform i mean

2941
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,080
who's to say that might be just actually

2942
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,840
going down the wrong path

2943
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,760
or it might be a very valuable piece of

2944
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,040
information or it is reducing our

2945
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,280
uncertainty about something but it may

2946
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,320
or may not be related to the general

2947
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,080
question it might be related like yes it

2948
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,080
turns out that this wavelength is a

2949
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,360
differentiator of whether someone is

2950
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,040
going to experience pain or remember

2951
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:39,840
pain

2952
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,400
during surgery it's so important because

2953
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,679
we don't want to

2954
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:44,719
have people who are suffering

2955
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:47,119
unnecessarily but then again is that the

2956
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:51,040
general answer to consciousness um

2957
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,560
interesting questions and then also to

2958
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,400
show wanja's 2020 paper 7-eleven 2020

2959
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,639
with these different ways

2960
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:00,480
that consciousness

2961
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,400
behavior and information could be linked

2962
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,920
and then i had a little qualia maybe

2963
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,320
consciousness is qualia or like you know

2964
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,920
what if there's a thought without a

2965
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,000
thinker or a thinker without a thought

2966
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,159
or there's all these different options

2967
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,600
and um

2968
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,360
it's also just

2969
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,960
it's a space where there's a lot of

2970
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,560
possible perspectives in the scientific

2971
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,000
literature in the neuroscientific

2972
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,760
literature of the last say 200 years

2973
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,639
it's only one facet of a really

2974
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:29,600
nuanced story of humans understanding

2975
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,080
their local world so it's just really

2976
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,000
awesome and um we'll have just time for

2977
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,400
a couple more thoughts and questions but

2978
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,719
yes adam and then dave if you'd like to

2979
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,440
add anything feel free

2980
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,639
you know i don't cure you for some

2981
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,560
reason adam but you're not oh yeah

2982
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,880
personally

2983
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,639
i personally like making uh

2984
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,119
consciousness synonymous with qualia and

2985
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,280
that's like the um

2986
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,119
that's the iit stance

2987
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:06,480
but um in terms of uh

2988
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,280
what you were saying with respect to um

2989
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,600
different types of senses of space

2990
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,280
i was just and then in general what

2991
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,639
you're like pointing out in general is

2992
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:15,440
like

2993
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,920
trying to find non-question begging uses

2994
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,880
of terminology and claims

2995
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:21,840
um

2996
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,840
like

2997
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,560
so for instance like within like my own

2998
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,400
thinking i talk about spatial temporal

2999
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,119
and causal coherence but at which level

3000
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,400
and i actually there's a little bit of

3001
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,719
an ambiguity there in my thinking that

3002
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,400
like it's actually i think it's showing

3003
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,040
up and entering at every scale but in

3004
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,880
different ways so for instance you could

3005
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,880
think of a certain um

3006
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,000
just

3007
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,760
entailed and for instance having a

3008
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,880
hierarchical um predictive memory system

3009
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,080
just having something like a heartfelt

3010
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,000
structure like cortex you might have

3011
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,080
itself some element of spatial and

3012
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,000
temporal coherence built in just there

3013
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,760
via things like

3014
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,840
at the initial levels having a

3015
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,159
topographic mapping to the world and

3016
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,920
then preserving that to some degree and

3017
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,920
maybe reintroducing it again later but

3018
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,000
this idea of like some degree of

3019
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,679
preserving of space

3020
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,320
time being preserved by some sort of

3021
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,520
coupling and then some sort of uh

3022
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,800
homomorphism and maybe some sort of

3023
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,880
increasing temporal depth of

3024
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,639
nested

3025
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,000
causes that unfold in different time

3026
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,360
scales via

3027
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,880
a hierarchy where the deep levels are

3028
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,800
things that are unfolding more slowly so

3029
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,960
you're getting some time just there

3030
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,199
um and cause you might even think of

3031
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,040
something like spike timing dependent

3032
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,440
plasticity where you wire up the system

3033
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,600
based on um the predictive information

3034
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,880
coming in the right order as being like

3035
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,199
a kind of protocol prior since like

3036
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,119
causes ought to proceed effects

3037
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,199
however that's a different sense than

3038
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,560
like for instance

3039
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,360
a richer sense that might be important

3040
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,920
for the appearance of a world of space

3041
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,840
time and cause where it would come in

3042
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,960
for instance in terms of

3043
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,239
potentially something that's more

3044
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:00,639
constructed it's like what type of space

3045
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:02,400
are we dealing with if you're in like

3046
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,960
this buckminster fuller world um that

3047
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,480
might be a very different sense of space

3048
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,320
it might not be xyz

3049
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,920
and there might be a different sense of

3050
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,760
time for you and a different sense of

3051
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,760
cause by the time we get to

3052
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,679
phenomenalities or rather i think it is

3053
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:17,040
a different sense

3054
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:17,840
um

3055
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,639
and

3056
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,800
then there might be yet another sense in

3057
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,280
terms of like the inter-subjective and

3058
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,800
the higher like the more narrative

3059
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,520
meaning-making of space-time and cause

3060
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,679
where it's like the metaphors we use

3061
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,840
about space and time and the ways we

3062
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,159
construct these like linguistically and

3063
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,239
like these higher order semantics and

3064
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,400
then these by couple as priors for each

3065
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,880
other in all sorts of interesting ways

3066
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,360
so um there's like ambiguity there or

3067
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,280
like there's um and i guess to kind of

3068
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,639
come back to

3069
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,199
this idea of like so i've been thinking

3070
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,360
that um

3071
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,840
uh you couldn't think of like within

3072
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,480
global neural workspace theory um

3073
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,560
that i kind of generalize it a bit and

3074
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,639
that i treat the workspace as not just

3075
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:03,440
this like fronto parietal network i

3076
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,719
would consider it to be a type of

3077
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,199
workspace and potentially a type of

3078
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,280
virtual machine workspace

3079
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,880
of um uh i think that uh where it's

3080
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,719
involving these action perception cycles

3081
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:15,920
being closed

3082
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,679
um like these kind of fictive

3083
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,000
imaginative action perception cycles

3084
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,520
or real ones but

3085
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,040
um you could also think of let's say

3086
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,800
you're just having like the estimates of

3087
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,320
the sensorium like you're getting these

3088
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,600
like

3089
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,440
these compo these nest densities or

3090
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:32,320
harmonic self-organizing harmonic modes

3091
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,119
like

3092
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,199
if you're getting big swaps of cortex

3093
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:37,280
all engaging in marginal messaging all

3094
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,719
communicating their beliefs together to

3095
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:40,639
create a joint estimate of the

3096
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,480
engagement of the system with its world

3097
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,760
it may not involve the whole system but

3098
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,440
if it's big enough i still consider that

3099
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,960
to be kind of like consistent with a

3100
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,600
global workspace it's big it's allowing

3101
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,880
multiple things to kind of do this

3102
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,800
ensemble slash federated learning and

3103
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,360
inference creating the synergy getting a

3104
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,719
hole that squared in someone's parts

3105
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,639
making information more globally

3106
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,159
available or creating like fame in the

3107
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:02,159
brain as then then called it and so i'd

3108
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:03,440
say like that's still very that's a

3109
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,280
workspace it's a sort of iterated

3110
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,960
bayesian model selection

3111
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,800
but like within but what do we mean by

3112
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,920
workspace

3113
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,080
and how much when we say workspace

3114
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,119
at some levels do we mean spatial itself

3115
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,280
is it like is the workspace itself a

3116
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,960
kind of space

3117
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,040
and but now to what degree is it a

3118
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,560
constructed space and what kind of

3119
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,800
constructed space

3120
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,320
ah

3121
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,320
and global oh well of course i don't

3122
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,639
mean like the globe global i mean like

3123
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,600
you know something else it when things

3124
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,119
are universal global basic there's so

3125
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:39,360
many adjectives that

3126
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,199
help people share

3127
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,360
memes and ideas

3128
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,199
but really don't always reduce

3129
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,920
uncertainty about what's being discussed

3130
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,880
because they're being used in explicitly

3131
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:51,639
a

3132
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:53,520
non-helpful way

3133
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,520
and so it's um

3134
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,199
it's always a challenge to parse out and

3135
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:02,480
translate sometimes even on the fly

3136
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,440
which

3137
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,280
types of usage are actually like okay

3138
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,119
attention is actually supposedly about

3139
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,560
the thing we're talking about here but

3140
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,239
global okay it's a totally different

3141
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:12,000
usage and there's a bunch of times when

3142
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,280
the same sentence you have words that

3143
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,560
are like really drawn from different

3144
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,639
name spaces they're drawn from quite

3145
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:18,880
different um views yeah adam and then

3146
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,080
dave if you ever want to you know add

3147
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,440
anything go ahead raise your hand but go

3148
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,199
ahead adam just a quick thought i was

3149
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,040
just like in general

3150
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,040
i think part of it is like

3151
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,280
we need to use more words and not argue

3152
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,600
so much about like what words mean is if

3153
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,199
like we're receiving them from plato's

3154
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,679
philosopher king they came on to us on

3155
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,400
highs this ideal form rather like words

3156
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,639
as tools and making them useful tools

3157
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,000
and like you know we're going to want to

3158
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,800
probably stick as much as we can to like

3159
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,800
common or folk like usage and like folk

3160
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,560
psychology as much as we can

3161
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,320
but sometimes we won't but

3162
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,080
basically trying to find the one that

3163
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,040
does

3164
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,080
the least

3165
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,679
uh

3166
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,080
that captures the senses of use that we

3167
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,440
tend to use

3168
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,679
um as much as we can

3169
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,360
but also

3170
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,280
uh

3171
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,199
well while sometimes pushing back on

3172
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,119
like our common understandings

3173
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,480
um

3174
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,560
but you know

3175
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,960
i think along this though using like

3176
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,880
more words like

3177
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,320
phenomenal consciousness access

3178
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,599
consciousness maybe we want to break

3179
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:22,960
those down further um you know uh

3180
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,639
there's a limit to what we can do before

3181
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,639
the tools become like not serviceable in

3182
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,880
our hands but i think

3183
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,639
we definitely should be using more than

3184
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,159
like i think people are tending to

3185
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,320
expect like this one-to-one mapping

3186
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,280
of word to the relevant natural kinds

3187
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,960
and i i think that's a problem i think

3188
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,400
that's uh

3189
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,040
i think we should at least two words

3190
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,800
maybe as many as three

3191
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
more than that i think is a problem um

3192
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,560
but i'd say two words we would do so

3193
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,800
much better for always using

3194
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,080
two

3195
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,280
thanks adam um dave

3196
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,280
yeah the uh

3197
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,320
you mentioned plato uh the latest

3198
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,080
edition of uh

3199
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,199
sean carroll's mindscape uh the the

3200
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:08,800
guest is um says there's two scholars in

3201
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,000
china who are explicit and proud

3202
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,639
followers of leo strauss and they have

3203
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,400
followed his method and read all the

3204
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,000
works of plato

3205
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,560
each one of which proves that xi jinping

3206
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,280
is the perfect leader and the the world

3207
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,960
that he rules is the best of all

3208
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,920
possible worlds

3209
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,000
and could you please send me an

3210
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
invitation to the uh markovian monism

3211
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
talk please

3212
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,560
thanks thanks for the uh statements and

3213
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,800
claims and questions yes so

3214
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,400
um

3215
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,560
yeah yeah yeah go away

3216
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,719
so in terms of like one concrete debate

3217
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:48,080
and like consciousness studies so for

3218
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,480
instance um it seems like a lot of the

3219
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,320
dispute between like global neural

3220
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,840
workspace theory and angry information

3221
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,400
theory could be resolvable and

3222
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,000
them just talking about consciousness in

3223
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,440
different senses and if we add

3224
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,119
additional words this will become clear

3225
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:02,480
so instead of like

3226
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,520
fighting

3227
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,119
engaging this like death match if the

3228
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,119
word will be this there can be only one

3229
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,960
it would be like okay so maybe

3230
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,920
iit is focusing on phenomenality and

3231
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,920
maybe um

3232
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,119
gnwt is focusing on access

3233
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:20,159
and when iit says that the physical and

3234
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:22,159
potentially computational substrates of

3235
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,520
consciousness are tend to be

3236
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,760
corresponding to posterior hot zone they

3237
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,480
might be largely correct and when gnwt

3238
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,000
says it's actually

3239
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,679
a more broadly distributed frontal

3240
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,599
parietal lexus they might be correct

3241
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:34,400
also

3242
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,760
but in one case they're talking more

3243
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,760
about phenomenal consciousness in one

3244
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,960
case you're talking more about access

3245
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,800
consciousness and so like there's this

3246
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,639
huge like adversarial collaboration

3247
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:44,880
happening but actually i'm worried that

3248
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,560
it's all in the wrong terms assuming

3249
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,719
that like one framework will be the

3250
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:49,679
victor

3251
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,520
when actually it should be

3252
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,679
not that you're all right in like a like

3253
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:56,000
a wash that way but for the like sure

3254
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,520
let's go for a minimal unifying model it

3255
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,920
won't just sink but there might be like

3256
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,400
this minimally model might take in

3257
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,040
both parties and they might be happy i i

3258
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,960
t people might be happy gmwt people

3259
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,639
might be happy if we just use more words

3260
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:11,440
yep

3261
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,480
um okay no one has to be wrong

3262
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,480
you might be but no one has to be wrong

3263
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,040
i'll give a take on it dave though

3264
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:21,360
yeah maybe some of the folks to

3265
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,560
helpfully

3266
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,400
remind us that the map is not the

3267
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,840
territory should just go back and read

3268
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,639
science insanity

3269
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:32,560
sounds good and and what i kind of got

3270
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,560
out of there with consciousness and this

3271
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,360
is i guess hopefully an approach we're

3272
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,679
enacting and carrying through is

3273
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:42,080
how are we going to share the tools

3274
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,800
maybe statistical parametric mapping spm

3275
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,880
toolkit maybe the developing active

3276
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,560
inference toolkit how are we going to

3277
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,159
share the tools and align on action

3278
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,719
that is within everyone's affordance um

3279
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,239
within everyone's niche

3280
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:57,599
rather than

3281
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:00,719
zero in on the eternal essential and

3282
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,719
truly fundamental differences in our

3283
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,280
perspectives and contexts um you're not

3284
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,560
gonna get people to agree on what a

3285
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,119
pizza is you're not gonna get people to

3286
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,480
agree on what culture is and so we're

3287
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,760
way way way past physical objects here

3288
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,880
and so

3289
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,440
how are we going to have a a story and

3290
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,760
an approach field where we can come

3291
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,159
together and reduce our uncertainty

3292
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:26,239
about like our physiology and our

3293
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:27,920
emotional responses which are part of

3294
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:29,679
our physiology

3295
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,239
and focus on potentially the before the

3296
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:35,599
decimal point shared reality rather than

3297
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,320
the after the decimal point divergences

3298
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,560
in the seventh adjective or the list

3299
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,840
ordering adam

3300
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:47,119
i think that what you're saying actually

3301
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,360
in some ways that's the essence of

3302
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,760
like the way to proceed in that like i

3303
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,599
feel like no one has to be wrong because

3304
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:55,599
we all have to be wrong all the time

3305
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,119
like all you know all models all

3306
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,400
metaphors are wrong some of them are

3307
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,920
useful and we're going for maximal use

3308
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,440
and it's not saying that like this is a

3309
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,840
post-modern wish wash and anything goes

3310
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,320
but there's going to be some uses of

3311
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,400
terminology that are more or less

3312
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,480
helpful for getting at basically

3313
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,560
different grips on the latent world

3314
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,400
and um

3315
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,840
for which all of our words are mere

3316
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:23,520
approximations um there is a world there

3317
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,280
are better and worse ways to describe it

3318
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,560
but these better and worse ways of

3319
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,400
describing it there's always an interest

3320
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,000
and it's our interests

3321
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,239
and so i think bringing like basically

3322
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:34,239
our values back into the picture

3323
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:36,080
hopefully our shared values and this

3324
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,159
being

3325
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,159
that's how we have to proceed i i

3326
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:43,040
totally agree i think that um the the

3327
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,199
movement that is reflected by people

3328
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:46,880
calling for transparency or

3329
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,199
interpretability or reproducibility in

3330
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:51,599
machine learning let's say it reflects a

3331
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,000
desire to be able to really

3332
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,599
weave together

3333
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,280
who is being served and who's being

3334
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:00,159
influenced and our values with technical

3335
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:01,199
details

3336
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,239
and so

3337
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:03,679
it's just

3338
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,520
it's been special and been really

3339
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,760
interesting to think about how something

3340
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,560
that

3341
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,000
you know you could

3342
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,440
call out some

3343
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,000
technical component but it provides a

3344
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,360
starting place

3345
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,840
for actually fully intertwining our

3346
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,239
values in and um yeah it's gonna be a

3347
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:22,000
tightrope to walk between

3348
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,080
everyone's correct no one's correct

3349
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,840
everyone is neither correct nor

3350
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,520
uncorrect or everyone's involved in a

3351
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:30,000
process of correction how are we gonna

3352
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,440
move from the essentialist claims like

3353
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,440
who's right and who's not or which

3354
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,119
subcomponent of myself are correct or

3355
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:36,000
not

3356
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,360
to a broader story of

3357
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,880
whatever it ends up being in different

3358
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,239
people's perspective and there wouldn't

3359
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,159
be any sequence of words

3360
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,520
english or otherwise from any speaker

3361
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,719
that is gonna end up

3362
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,560
being the end-all because they're just

3363
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,080
it's like the finger in the moon you're

3364
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,440
pointing at the moon

3365
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,800
you're not pointing to the spot at the

3366
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,360
tip of your finger it's something far

3367
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,639
far away

3368
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:03,280
and something aspirational so that's how

3369
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,719
the words are

3370
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:06,560
and especially with the consciousness

3371
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,560
you know again even with the food

3372
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,480
like i would say that

3373
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:12,000
food could be an aspirational or an

3374
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,119
asymptotic or a platonic thing but then

3375
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,480
this is like

3376
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,840
quite

3377
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,520
wrapped up in our own experience of

3378
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,360
course so

3379
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,040
thanks so much to the two of you guys

3380
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,880
any few um

3381
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,119
any last thoughts or just what does this

3382
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,480
excite you

3383
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,679
um about

3384
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:31,840
moving forward

3385
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,800
or what would be some next thoughts or

3386
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,239
just imagine some archetype of some

3387
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:41,199
listener or viewer and what would you

3388
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:44,719
suggest to them ask them

3389
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,560
i mean for me

3390
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,280
and like it's both like fundamental the

3391
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:54,159
question like the just

3392
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:55,520
you know

3393
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,520
what is consciousness what is life who

3394
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,320
who am i what what what's going on like

3395
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,199
it's it it's of a like an existential

3396
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:06,080
meaningful character these conversations

3397
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:08,480
but i also think um

3398
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,639
basically i'm hoping that we're getting

3399
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,000
close to

3400
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,239
um bringing back in

3401
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:17,360
consciousness uh in a meaningful way

3402
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,960
into science

3403
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,000
um

3404
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,440
kind of overcoming

3405
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,520
basically a kind of behaviorist legacy

3406
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,360
where it kind of made sense to make some

3407
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,520
things uh somewhat taboo for a time

3408
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,480
because we didn't feel like we had

3409
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:31,040
purchase but then that taboo became

3410
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,280
maybe stifling and tyrannical i don't

3411
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,719
know if we've completely shrugged it off

3412
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,119
yet but there's a sense where

3413
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,639
um

3414
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:41,040
by we try to be as precise as we can we

3415
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,639
contextualize you know what are our

3416
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,719
value commitments what is the specific

3417
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:46,400
way in which we're using terminology in

3418
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,840
this case trying to be as precise as we

3419
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,800
can

3420
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,159
i think we might be at a point where we

3421
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:51,599
can start to

3422
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,280
bring things like consciousness back in

3423
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,639
without having to be embarrassed about

3424
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,639
it and i think this embarrassment

3425
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,800
actually did something really bad which

3426
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,040
basically took your experience

3427
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,119
and removed it out of the scientific

3428
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,520
discourse and basically made it unreal

3429
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,719
and i think we're going to discover not

3430
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:07,920
only was this

3431
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,199
bad for us

3432
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:11,280
personally interpersonally but it was

3433
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,560
bad for us scientifically because i

3434
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,719
actually suspect that consciousness is

3435
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:16,400
the maximally

3436
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,760
important

3437
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,400
informational and energetic object

3438
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,960
in at least our minds

3439
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,320
and that this we basically hid

3440
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,880
the main story we made taboo telling the

3441
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,400
main story

3442
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,280
and

3443
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,119
that we made taboo different things that

3444
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,080
like part of the reason we didn't have

3445
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,159
purchase was that it was we were being

3446
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:38,159
imprecise it was hard but part of it was

3447
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:39,599
we made taboo the things we would need

3448
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,760
to make purchase so phenomenology we

3449
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,199
made experience taboo and then we

3450
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,800
wondered why it was so hard to make

3451
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,639
purchase unconsciousness no one was

3452
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,000
talking about embodiment and then we're

3453
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,239
like hmm why aren't i able to

3454
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,080
cross-explanatory gaps with a giant

3455
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,599
flailing leap

3456
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:56,719
and that unfortunately in a historical

3457
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:00,080
in a cultural context it led to divide

3458
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,320
and conquer of academia it led to the

3459
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,040
bifurcation of

3460
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:07,199
non-academic experience with academic

3461
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,599
research it led to disciplinary

3462
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,560
um unneeded friction i i really agree

3463
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,760
with that um

3464
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,320
it's like it was a scientific error to

3465
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,760
think that the finger was pointing at

3466
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,440
the tip of the finger and say well

3467
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,280
because we don't know exactly the detail

3468
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,119
we're going to like not just

3469
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:24,639
you know write a review paper and then

3470
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,280
go back to our lab we're going to go on

3471
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,199
stage and we're going to tell people

3472
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:30,639
that they're zombies we're going to tell

3473
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:31,840
people that they're robots or we're

3474
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,679
going to tell them this is how the brain

3475
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:35,440
generates consciousness and so that's

3476
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,199
why i'm always excited to hear about new

3477
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:39,599
research in the field but

3478
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:40,400
i

3479
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,560
would hope that kind of like coffee and

3480
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,960
cream like it would always be

3481
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,239
blended

3482
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:47,920
with a recognition that it's an open

3483
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,159
question it's an experienced

3484
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:51,920
um

3485
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,840
it's something we're experiencing

3486
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,239
and so we're not just gonna cut it and

3487
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,719
try it leave on stage 15 minute talk

3488
01:59:58,719 --> 01:59:59,840
it's done

3489
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,760
because think about how many thousands

3490
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,760
of those lectures have been delivered

3491
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,239
in the last hundred years from

3492
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:07,840
when you know today's nurse oh that was

3493
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,520
too early but they were just being

3494
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,800
enthusiastic to today and that's tens of

3495
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
thousands of people or however many

3496
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,679
people who got um pushed in a different

3497
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:19,040
direction

3498
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:22,480
because um using legacy credentials they

3499
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,080
were told their experience was not

3500
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,560
concordant with science which is really

3501
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,400
something that's hard to estimate the

3502
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,880
impact of

3503
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,679
one more thing would be

3504
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,440
i want i'm also open to there might be

3505
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:40,159
some uh things that might be cut and dry

3506
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:42,400
and i don't know so for instance one of

3507
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,639
them could be at questions like it's

3508
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:45,760
possible

3509
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,679
that first like depending on how which

3510
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:49,760
senses of consciousness we mean

3511
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,239
that there might be um cut and dry

3512
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:54,000
versus more graded distinctions we

3513
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
should be looking for so it could be or

3514
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,360
could not be the case that basic

3515
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,040
phenomenality is cut and dry we don't

3516
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,960
know um i have flossed this but one

3517
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,199
thing would then kind of later coming in

3518
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:05,760
this might have relevance now for things

3519
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:07,760
like animal rights and this might have

3520
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,719
relevance going forward for things like

3521
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:12,639
the future of ai

3522
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:13,760
maybe

3523
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,280
can we create artificial general

3524
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,199
intelligence and then when if and when

3525
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:19,199
we do if we survive long enough and if

3526
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:21,679
we're smart enough will these be um

3527
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:24,080
morally relevant agents or will they be

3528
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:25,840
part of our moral communities

3529
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,719
and so

3530
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:28,000
um

3531
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,679
whether things are graded or not it

3532
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,040
could end up being crucial there might

3533
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,960
be some cases where it's like aha once

3534
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,719
we nail down our use of words based on

3535
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:37,119
our interests and we have like this many

3536
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:39,440
qualifiers we feel like okay this is the

3537
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,320
optimal grip on like

3538
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,760
numeral space whatever this is like the

3539
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:46,080
optimal grip on the world on on light in

3540
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,920
space and you say okay

3541
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,119
cut and dry

3542
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:51,199
but it might not be but this this might

3543
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:52,480
be the most important questions

3544
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,159
ultimately that we can ever ask

3545
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,679
and here's where i think active

3546
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:57,599
inference might speak to it dave then if

3547
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:00,000
you want to anything or not is here's

3548
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,520
where it's cut and dry

3549
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,239
the observables sense and action and so

3550
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,920
we can be clear about what we're cut and

3551
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,840
dry outside here's how um

3552
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:10,560
using um the theory of information

3553
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,480
processing we're talking about auditory

3554
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,280
processing but then to go that next

3555
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,199
level of emotional salience and say and

3556
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:18,960
this is why you hear this when this

3557
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,920
happens

3558
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,520
that's the part where it can be

3559
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:24,080
clarified that there's things that are

3560
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,800
um basically cut and dry models

3561
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,599
but those are cut and dry because

3562
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:31,360
they've been partitioned from a broader

3563
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,400
field

3564
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,920
of discussion

3565
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,480
not because one day the cut and dry is

3566
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,080
going to be everything it's actually

3567
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,080
like everything isn't that way and we've

3568
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,040
made these islands of stability

3569
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:47,040
um that are are despite that not like

3570
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,880
the other way around so

3571
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,320
um

3572
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,400
dave any last comments

3573
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,719
thanks so much this was really um really

3574
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,800
awesome conversation as always

3575
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,560
appreciate the live participants and the

3576
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,080
those in the live chat and watching

3577
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,960
later this is it for actually the first

3578
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,960
quarter of 2021

3579
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,920
for active stream pretty fun next week

3580
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,760
we're going to be having our quarterly

3581
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,440
round table so if anybody wants to make

3582
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,880
like a three to five minute video for

3583
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,560
this one or a future round table they're

3584
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,000
welcome to do that

3585
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:18,800
then

3586
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:19,920
um

3587
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,679
we're gonna be having these upcoming

3588
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:24,159
events so it's gonna be just

3589
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:27,760
on with the show and the learning and

3590
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,920
doing and participating so thanks

3591
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,719
