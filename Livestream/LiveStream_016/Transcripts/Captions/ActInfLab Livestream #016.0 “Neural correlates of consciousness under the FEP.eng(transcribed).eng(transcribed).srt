00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,160
inference live stream

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
and this is the active inference lab i'm

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,520
daniel friedman

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,439
and i'm really excited to be having this

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
conversation with my friend blue

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,439
hi blue welcome to the active inference

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,400
lab everyone

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
we are an experiment in online team

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,679
communication

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,840
learning and practice related to active

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
inference you can find us on our

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
website twitter email discord youtube

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,360
whatever it may be in the future this is

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,520
a recorded and an archived live stream

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
so please provide us with feedback so

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
that we can improve on our work

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,320
welcome here and we will

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
look forward to using good dialogue

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,920
video etiquette

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,719
today in 16.0 we're going to be setting

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,680
the stage for

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
february 16th and february 23rd 2021's

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,239
events which are both going to be

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
discussions on this same paper we're

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
talking about today

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
and for the 16th we're going to have the

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,640
author

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159
um wanja whis join us for the discussion

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
today in 16.0 the goal is really to set

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
the context for 16.1

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,920
and 16.2 which are participatory group

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
discussions

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
the paper we're discussing is the neural

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
correlates of consciousness under the

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,000
free energy principle

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
from computational correlates to

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
computational explanation

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
by whis and carl fristen november 18th

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
2020

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
and there's a link given the video is

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
not uh

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,840
uh it is an introduction to the context

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
it's not a review or a final word

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
blue and i just gave it a read we're

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,799
still working through these issues we

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,520
hope to kind of

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
surface what we're thinking about on

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
those topics and one of the punch lines

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
is that fep it's not a singular theory

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
or definition of consciousness

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
itself but it lends itself to some

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
pretty powerful thinking and theory

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
development in this area

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
and in the video of 16 we're gonna go uh

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
with an introduction section and thanks

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
blue for the structural

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,920
tip we're gonna talk about the author's

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,119
perspective on

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,560
their introduction really aims and

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
claims abstract and roadmap

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
then we'll consider the keywords kind of

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
just where we were at with those topics

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
and where we think there might be a nice

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
bi-directional road kind of on and on on

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
and off ramp from active inference

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
and then we'll actually go through a

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
fair amount of the details of the paper

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,160
including some of the

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
formalisms close with a couple questions

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,599
and thoughts

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,480
and in 16.1 and 16.2 we'll be discussing

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
this paper

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
so that is all for the introduction

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
let's go to the aims and claims of the

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
paper

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,640
um the paper was as stated blue do you

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,599
want to um

80
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,200
read the aims and claims sure

81
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,599
the first aim is how can research on

82
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
neural correlates of consciousness

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
lead to an explanation of consciousness

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,200
and what role could the free energy

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
principle the fvp

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
play in this endeavor we have suggested

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
that research on neural correlates

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,120
should be

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
complemented by research on

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
computational correlates of

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
consciousness

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
cccs in order to yield a computational

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
explanation of consciousness

94
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
moreover according to the free energy

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
principle neuro

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
neural correlates of consciousness must

97
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
be defined in terms of neural dynamics

98
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
not neural states and compulational

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,959
correlates of consciousness

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
should be defined in terms of

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
probabilities encoded by neural states

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
all we hope to have shown is that a

103
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
computational explanation of

104
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
consciousness is possible

105
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
and that the free energy principle can

106
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
make a significant contribution to this

107
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
project

108
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
big aims and claims um and a lot of

109
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
interesting things

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
that are already being mentioned a lot

111
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
of these words we're gonna dive into

112
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,159
so if it's their first time hearing some

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,239
of these terms and acronyms

114
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,680
or whether these are things where you're

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
already bringing a lot of priors to the

116
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,159
table

117
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
hopefully you'll be able to look at it

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
in a new light and these are big topics

119
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,080
so

120
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
there's just going to be a lot

121
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
underlying these aims and claims

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
anything else you'd add on those um

123
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
cool let's talk about the abstract which

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
is how the authors have distilled and

125
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
summarized their work

126
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
for broad uh reading so this is the

127
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
section that most people

128
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
read it's kind of like a power law where

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
a few people see the title and the

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
smaller subsets see the abstract and it

131
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,519
goes down so we

132
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
always look at how the authors reflect

133
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
their work in the abstract

134
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
so i'll read the first half the abstract

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
and then you can give a thought on

136
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
something in there

137
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,759
how can the free energy principle

138
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,280
contribute to research on

139
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
neural correlates of consciousness and

140
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
to the scientific study of consciousness

141
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
more generally

142
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
under the free energy principle neural

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
correlates should be defined in terms of

144
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
neurodynamics

145
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
not neural states and should be

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
complemented by the research on

147
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,639
computational correlates of

148
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,440
consciousness

149
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,199
defined in terms of probabilities

150
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,040
encoded by neural states

151
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
we argue that these restrictions

152
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
brighten the prospects of a

153
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
computational explanation by addressing

154
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
two central problems

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
so just a thought there i think that um

156
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
the fep is really well suited to

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
providing a computational explanation of

158
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
consciousness or

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
a computational correlate of

160
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
consciousness um

161
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,280
if we can kind of maybe talk about

162
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
the easy problem of consciousness right

163
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
which which we'll get into the hard easy

164
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,000
and

165
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
medium problems of consciousness but

166
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
really the easy problem of consciousness

167
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,639
is is well

168
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
described by the fep and i don't know

169
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,039
that we can really even

170
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,960
in like nail down what exactly

171
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
consciousness is except

172
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,840
from that computational standpoint cool

173
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
and this question of defining

174
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
consciousness it's gonna

175
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
rear its head a million different ways

176
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
not the least of which when deciding

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
what to measure or which analogy

178
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,280
to use having a computational versus

179
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
some other type of adjective that you

180
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,000
could put there

181
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
so how about you go for recapitulating

182
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,199
that

183
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
last point which is there's two central

184
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
problems that are going to be addressed

185
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
and then continue

186
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
so we argue that these restrictions

187
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
brighten the prospect

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
of a computational explanation of

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
consciousness by addressing two central

190
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,319
problems

191
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,600
the first is to account for

192
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
consciousness in the absence of sensory

193
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
stimulation

194
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
and behavior the second is to allow for

195
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
the possibility of systems that

196
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
implement computations associated with

197
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
consciousness

198
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
without being conscious which requires

199
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,960
differentiating between computational

200
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
systems that merely simulate conscious

201
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,680
beings

202
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
and computational systems that are

203
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
conscious in and of themselves

204
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
given the notation of or the notion of

205
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
computation entailed by the free energy

206
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,800
principle

207
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
we will derive constraints on the

208
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
inscription of consciousness

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,639
in controversial cases for example in

210
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
the absence of sensory stimulation

211
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
and behavior we show that this also has

212
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
implications for what it means to be

213
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
as opposed to merely simulate a

214
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,440
conscious system

215
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
cool so the two key

216
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
problems the central problems one is

217
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
what happens in the absence of stimuli

218
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
and then the second big plot block of

219
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,800
text is

220
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
um the difference between actually being

221
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
conscious versus simulating it

222
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
and then by thinking about these two

223
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
central problems and using the fep

224
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
as our guide remember we're under

225
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
according to the title under the fep

226
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
not because of the fep or some other way

227
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,639
of talking about it

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
under the fep we're going to think about

229
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
how this notion of computation

230
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
is actually going to lead to some unique

231
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
predictions and

232
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,639
explanations and hypotheses that then we

233
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
can talk about in a really scientific

234
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:24,720
way

235
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
that will take it out of the land of

236
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
abstraction and well what about this

237
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
thought experiment and what about this

238
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,720
uncertainty here

239
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
and towards the realm of well this model

240
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
predicts that this kind of a brain or

241
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
this kind of an agent

242
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
will have this type of measurement or

243
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
response in this context

244
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
we want to have that conscious

245
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
consciousness a meter

246
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,560
the measuring device but without the

247
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
definition it's hard to have the

248
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
measuring device

249
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
and vice versa and so fep looks like a

250
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
promising way to sort of navigate that

251
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
paradox

252
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
let's go to the roadmap so this

253
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
is a paper structure with six

254
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,840
sections an introduction and a

255
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
conclusion and with four

256
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
internal sections the first internal

257
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
section and we're going to go through a

258
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,039
lot of these keywords in just a second

259
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
starts from neural correlates of

260
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
consciousness and moves the discussion

261
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,199
from thinking

262
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
neurally to thinking computationally so

263
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,639
that's the movement from neural

264
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
correlates to computational correlates

265
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
of consciousness

266
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
then the third section moves from the

267
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
computational correlates of

268
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,639
consciousness

269
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
into the free energy principle surprise

270
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,919
surprise

271
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
the fourth section goes back to

272
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,759
computational correlates

273
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
and moves the um the focus the regime of

274
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
attention

275
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,839
from computational chords alone which

276
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
have already been linked to the fep

277
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
to computational explanations of

278
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,440
consciousness and then the fifth section

279
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
brings together the computational

280
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
explanations of consciousness

281
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,279
with some of the first authors previous

282
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
research on minimal unifying models of

283
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,080
consciousness

284
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
and all of this is implicitly interwoven

285
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
with fep

286
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
which is kind of what is being tied

287
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,959
together with this paper

288
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
so any thoughts on the structure or the

289
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
roadmap blue

290
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
no it's good it was a good um flow i

291
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
thought yep a dense

292
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
paper so definitely okay to take it in

293
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,160
many

294
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
sections and skip around and skim it

295
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
through it first there's a lot of

296
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,839
ways that each person will read

297
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,920
different genres of paper

298
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
okay the keywords the part we've been

299
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
excited to

300
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
talk about i guess all of it though and

301
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
we just took the keywords

302
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
from the paper and laid them out

303
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
uh in an order and tried to present each

304
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,680
keyword in a way that was standalone on

305
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,920
just one or two slides

306
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
again thinking about the on and the off

307
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
ramp for active inference

308
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
so if you read this because fristen's

309
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
one of the authors or because it came up

310
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
in a keyword search for free energy

311
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,680
principle

312
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
but maybe you haven't thought about some

313
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
of these other topics that's one

314
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
mode of listening and then the other

315
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
mode of listening is like maybe with

316
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
more experience

317
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
or having thought more about these

318
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
topics where's free energy principle and

319
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,399
active inference playing into all that

320
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
and then beginner's mind and learning by

321
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
doing plays on both directions of the

322
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,120
road

323
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
so our first keyword uh well let's just

324
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,959
actually read through the keywords

325
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
uh free energy principle and active

326
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
inference consciousness

327
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
minimal unifying model neural correlates

328
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
of consciousness

329
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
computational correlates of

330
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,399
consciousness computational explanation

331
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
and islands of awareness

332
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
okay so first free energy principle so

333
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
how about you read it and i'll give a

334
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
comment on the first half and then we'll

335
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
flip

336
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
awesome so the free energy principle

337
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
provides an

338
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
information theoretic analysis of the

339
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
concept of existence of self-organizing

340
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,959
systems

341
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,040
it entails that self-organizing systems

342
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
at non-equilibrium steady state bound

343
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
the entropy of their sensory signals by

344
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
minimizing on average

345
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
a quantity known as variational free

346
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
energy as such

347
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,200
fvp is not a theory of consciousness do

348
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
you want me to read the second part or

349
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,959
do you want to

350
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,800
switch now um i'll give a thought and

351
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
then we can switch if there's two i

352
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,399
guess

353
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
but just that in the first paragraph if

354
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,240
you only

355
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
dipped a toe in you'd already find that

356
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
fep is not itself a theory of

357
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,760
consciousness

358
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,560
so the debate's not done we're looking

359
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
at what the fep

360
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,959
is that's the first part of the

361
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,360
paragraph it's a certain information

362
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
theoretic analysis

363
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
for thinking about self-organizing

364
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
systems for complex adaptive systems

365
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
and it's not itself a theory of

366
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,399
consciousness so i think that that's

367
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,920
just a really nice way to open

368
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,519
the tone of the paper and the discussion

369
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,240
so the second part here referring to

370
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,519
what is the free energy principle and

371
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
how is this going to relate to the paper

372
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
a fundamental constraint provided by fep

373
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,839
is that it only applies to active

374
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,880
systems that engage with their

375
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,760
environment

376
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
hence a computer simulation of a system

377
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
that minimizes variational free energy

378
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
may perform computations that are

379
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
also instantiated by a conscious agent

380
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
that interacts with its environment

381
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
but if these computations are realized

382
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
by a piece of hardware that cannot be

383
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
regarded as an agent

384
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,839
eg they cannot move or change external

385
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
states then they can at most lead to a

386
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
simulation of consciousness

387
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
i think that this is interesting because

388
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,639
it's like it doesn't really

389
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
um just like delineate what exactly is

390
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,720
an

391
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
active system and what what is engaging

392
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,839
with the environment

393
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,200
like for example if you have like an

394
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
unborn baby inside

395
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
of the mother is that like an active

396
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,079
system engaging with its environment

397
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,399
like can does it have any control over

398
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,920
like the environment of the environment

399
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
is delivered to it like all

400
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
non-stationary like self-organizing

401
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
systems that are maybe more passive

402
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,839
like i think about like ocean you know

403
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
creatures that just sit there like

404
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
i know that the fep does apply but it

405
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
just doesn't really delineate

406
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,279
exactly what those systems are yep

407
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,320
agreed and um so if this is your first

408
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,720
time

409
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,240
hearing about it's obviously a big topic

410
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
there's a lot of ways to go about it

411
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
also i had a question like whether other

412
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
physical systems like a proton are we

413
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,920
going to include that as an active

414
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,720
system but

415
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,959
there's a lot of um is that an active

416
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,079
you know it's engaging with the

417
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
environment yes but is it active

418
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
um so that's where we're going what is

419
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
simulation versus actual consciousness

420
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,600
where's the fep

421
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
let's in this keyword section think

422
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
about just what is the fep before we

423
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,079
go that far out with a paper because we

424
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,200
wanted to draw on the quotes from the

425
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
paper to see where they were going with

426
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,600
the fep

427
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
and now let's pull back to just thinking

428
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
about what is the free energy principle

429
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
and this is a slide that had been used

430
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
actually a couple

431
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
uh active streams ago but it

432
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,399
actually a lot of the terms got reused

433
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,279
focker plank

434
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
helmholtz non-equilibrium steady state

435
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
markov blankets active inference

436
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,160
everything here

437
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
except for some of these more um

438
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
specific like

439
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
sub process theories on the neural side

440
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
almost everything here was discussed in

441
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,959
this paper

442
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,120
so this is why it's so interesting to

443
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,399
think about convergences between the

444
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,480
papers because there's a lot of overlap

445
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
we're on the right track and we can

446
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
hopefully start to reduce our

447
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,800
uncertainty

448
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
just to run through these the focker

449
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
plank and this is from mel andrews's

450
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,519
paper

451
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,519
and the history of thermodynamics of the

452
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
fep so active 14 if you want to

453
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
listen more but the focker plank is

454
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,720
bringing in

455
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
a uh uh vector

456
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
way in the helmholtz as well of dealing

457
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,600
with vectors

458
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
and mathematics for certain kinds of

459
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
systems

460
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
namely these non-equilibrium steady

461
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,079
state densities which we're going to go

462
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,360
into in more detail so we're not going

463
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
to go into it here

464
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,680
and the free energy principle is a just

465
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,440
as we said on the previous slide it's an

466
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
information theoretic analysis

467
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,360
approach for these kinds of systems

468
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,800
doing interesting stuff

469
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
non-equilibrium steady state cybernetic

470
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
systems

471
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
and using that type of vector

472
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
maths on it and then it leads to all of

473
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
these consequence

474
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,079
falsifiable testable hypotheses the

475
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,680
process theories up at the top and there

476
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
could be other things as well

477
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
anything else to add on that blue not at

478
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,800
all

479
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
all right so to go into one of the

480
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
process theories that we

481
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
like active inference and this is from

482
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
another paper we've discussed

483
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
a while ago vassal at all a world unto

484
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,360
itself

485
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,240
and this was thinking about

486
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
communication so on

487
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
11 we said okay it's about active

488
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
systems engaging with their world

489
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,440
slide 12 we're going to think about that

490
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
in this kind of thermo info

491
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,800
statistical way and then 13 okay

492
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
let's bring in almost the real processes

493
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,279
and almost a systems engineering or just

494
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
a systems modeling perspective

495
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,360
to what kinds of systems are engaging

496
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,720
with the world active

497
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
with a generative model of their niche

498
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,240
and how are we going to think about that

499
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
under the free energy principle that's

500
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
where active inference comes into play

501
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
and this is a diagram we see in many

502
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,759
guises

503
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,600
where you have internal states and

504
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
external states which are separated

505
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,040
by an interface that can be modeled as a

506
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
markov blanket but we'll also go into

507
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
more detail on that later

508
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,880
where what goes inside or from one side

509
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
of the interface to the other

510
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
is sensation coming in that changes

511
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,440
internal states

512
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
internal states such as uh

513
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
different uh policy estimates for the

514
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
world or different policy estimates

515
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
for what one's self will engage in

516
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
results in different action patterns

517
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,839
which

518
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,440
influence external states which also

519
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
have their endogenous dynamics

520
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
so that's active inference that's what

521
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,959
active inference lab is like

522
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,279
thinking about and coming at for many

523
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,560
angles so that's one

524
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
little just um snapshot of active

525
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,399
inference what is active inference for

526
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,279
you

527
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,800
today blue or what does this make you

528
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
think about

529
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
so i i'm always interested in reflecting

530
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,720
on

531
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
the internal states like hunger

532
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,639
right how that results in an external

533
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,120
action

534
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,199
like a behavior like i'm gonna go find

535
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,160
some food

536
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
so i'm always interested in reflecting

537
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
on on this and whether it's

538
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
um it can be reduced to

539
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
computation right like we know if we

540
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,759
have a good estimate of what our

541
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,720
predictive model

542
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
is or our generative model is if we have

543
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,160
that

544
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,320
uh estimate then we know like what's

545
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
coming at us what is the input

546
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,079
can we always predict output like are we

547
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,839
just the sum of of

548
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
are we just a computation like i always

549
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
think about that so it brings that up

550
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,079
for me

551
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,319
yep this is a skeleton but then if it's

552
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
skeletons all the way down

553
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,520
where's the meat where is the actual

554
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
self or is it something

555
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,160
other than that maybe it's that that is

556
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
the cell for some other thing like that

557
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,959
so active inference active inference

558
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,160
eight we talked about it from a

559
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,839
reinforcement learning and a control

560
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,439
theory perspective we've talked about it

561
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,199
from a historical angle

562
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,599
with mel and from a philosophical angle

563
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
um in 15

564
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,360
we're reintroducing consciousness which

565
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,720
we also talked about

566
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
in nine with the projective

567
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,760
consciousness model

568
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
so that consciousness free energy

569
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
principle active inference discussion

570
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,799
was about geometry and the projections

571
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,400
and then the way that agents did active

572
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
inference on this projective geometry

573
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
we're actually not going to talk about

574
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
that projective

575
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,280
almost perry personal space relationship

576
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
with the fep

577
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
and this paper is going to take the same

578
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
topics go in a little different way

579
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
with more of a focus on the information

580
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
theory and on the generative model

581
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
and on the divergence of a few different

582
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,600
kinds of

583
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
surprise and measurements of the world

584
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,440
so it's another facet

585
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
let's talk about the main piece of the

586
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
paper which is consciousness

587
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,880
so how many ways to start or cover it

588
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
um just when we were planning this as a

589
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
lab and talking about it people

590
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,919
were just bringing up good stuff in live

591
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,840
discussion so someone said a felt sense

592
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
of is-ness

593
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,120
people were asking like where do we look

594
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
for consciousness

595
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,559
what do we measure and where what

596
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,080
spatial temporal scales what kinds of

597
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,039
systems

598
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
and many people just pointed out there's

599
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,799
so many

600
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,360
understandings here and uh areas of

601
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,559
study i mean

602
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,840
if one is curious there's a great wealth

603
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
of resources

604
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,679
um before we dive into each facet of

605
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,240
this

606
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,440
hexaflower blue what does consciousness

607
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,799
what like what interested you in this

608
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
paper what makes you curious to

609
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
study these things so i don't know

610
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,600
consciousness is one of those things

611
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
that's like

612
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
love like we don't really have a good

613
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
like definition for it we all kind of

614
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
like

615
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
think we know what it is right like we

616
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
think we know what it is and what it

617
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,600
isn't

618
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,919
but but it's it's like a very you know

619
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,039
ethereal

620
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,919
concept um so i don't know it's always

621
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,559
interesting to try to tackle these like

622
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,720
things that can't really be pinpointed

623
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
or like nailed to a certain

624
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,600
like board right like you can't really

625
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
exactly define consciousness

626
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
it's always fun to kind of take a

627
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
scientific approach to evaluate these

628
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
things right like reduce love to you

629
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
know oxytocin or whatever but it's more

630
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,000
than that like it's it's

631
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
i mean clearly consciousness is more

632
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
than what any one thing that like where

633
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,600
it's more than the fep it's more than

634
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,720
what we're able to

635
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,600
you know attach to it project onto it

636
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
but it's it's

637
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
always interesting to try to tackle

638
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,679
these hard problems and i love the

639
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,559
hexaflower

640
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
so i've got to say like daniel put this

641
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,679
together it's like a

642
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
super cool design that takes

643
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
consciousness as the center point

644
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,960
and then integrates all of these

645
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
keywords that we're going to be

646
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
discussing the minimum unifying model

647
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
islands of awareness neural correlates

648
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,679
of consciousness computational

649
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,120
correlation consciousness

650
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,600
computational explanation and then the

651
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,640
easy medium

652
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
and hard problems of consciousness right

653
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,559
so all these are surrounding the

654
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
consciousness is the center point i love

655
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,720
it

656
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
what was kind of fun about that and

657
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,840
almost meta is like i was trying to

658
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,720
arrange the list

659
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,919
it's like okay we got active inference

660
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
free energy principle keywords get them

661
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,799
out of the way

662
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
then we have consciousness related

663
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
keywords and consciousness itself

664
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,720
and so how can they be arranged linearly

665
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
and it was like there's no single linear

666
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,919
arrangement

667
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
everyone could have a different way of

668
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,960
seeing that

669
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
so then um it's just something that from

670
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
studying to bs

671
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,559
we see the hexagon and then i see it

672
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
more like when we want to reflect

673
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,799
tiling but a coherent tiling like

674
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,159
settler's a catan

675
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,679
you can play on a bigger board smaller

676
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
board but instead of just something

677
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,039
that's blocky it's like

678
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,000
it's yeah okay so let's go to the first

679
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,400
little

680
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
sub pedal because thinking about the

681
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,640
problems that

682
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
steer us or that motivate us in

683
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
consciousness research

684
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,960
so this is like not you know moral

685
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,799
proclamations on consciousness

686
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,320
this is about scientific study of

687
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
consciousness and about investigations

688
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
um about people who are coming together

689
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,240
from different perspectives not just

690
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
living from within um one specific

691
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,400
definition

692
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,760
so people are going to be kind of

693
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
playing fast and loose and having

694
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,080
different

695
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
takes that's kind of the wildness of the

696
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
field so there's

697
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
famous framing of the hard problem of

698
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
consciousness by chalmers

699
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
in the 90s and subsequent research

700
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,200
that's a pretty famous

701
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
um singular moment but

702
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
i just thought of you know easy medium

703
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,360
and hard problems but different people

704
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,000
are going to perceive

705
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
different difficulties for some people

706
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
they're really hung up on

707
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
mind and body other people it's like a

708
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
speed bump they just say

709
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
yeah i mean it's this other way so

710
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
that's just something that

711
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
studying the field of consciousness

712
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
studies is so interesting to me is

713
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,280
some people a word they just they spend

714
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,080
their whole life

715
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
investigating it other people they just

716
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,679
blow right by it or it seems like a

717
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,880
question that totally

718
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
it even if they're aware of it isn't

719
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,240
something super

720
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,919
relevant so which problems are easy

721
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,159
medium and hard it fits in that category

722
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,440
there are hard problems like

723
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
how could a physical thing or can of

724
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
physical things generate conscious

725
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,080
awareness or how we know there's a lot

726
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,120
of hard problems

727
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,679
um but it's an interesting topic what

728
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
did this make you think about

729
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,039
um so i mean i think like i already

730
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,720
divulged what i was thinking about in

731
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
the easy medium and hard problems of

732
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,280
consciousness and

733
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
how kind of the fep really lends itself

734
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
to like the easy

735
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
problem and like really like are we so

736
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
reducible to the easy problem of

737
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,799
consciousness like i mean we all kind of

738
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
know that there's something like

739
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,159
more than that and like when we get into

740
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,520
that more than that

741
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
like thing do we become then like

742
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
less scientific and more like spiritual

743
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
okay like

744
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,559
like do we take some leap of faith going

745
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,159
into the hard problem of consciousness

746
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:00,720
or

747
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
are we just like ascribing some property

748
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
like if we're gonna really be scientific

749
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
about it like consciousness is one of

750
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,679
those things that if you're going to

751
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
buy into it like it has to kind of be

752
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,120
everywhere like

753
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
i mean we make this like hard cut off

754
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
like if you look at research like only

755
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
higher vertebrates that have a central

756
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
nervous system those are the only

757
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
like things that are conscious in the

758
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,039
world right like and

759
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
some people have like lines within that

760
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
like only humans right

761
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
so really can we can we draw these like

762
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,760
hard

763
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,679
boundaries like i don't know i kind of

764
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
feel like if consciousness exists

765
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,720
it's pervasive but maybe pervasive only

766
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,120
among

767
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
living systems but then as a tree

768
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
conscious

769
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
so it's one of these it's hard it's a

770
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,080
hard problem

771
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
yes um agreed and the easy one

772
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,279
is almost the part that explains it's

773
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
like when people make fun of

774
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,240
daniel dennett's book consciousness

775
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
explained consciousness explained away

776
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,600
it's like yeah we know how a robot would

777
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
respond to a sensory

778
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
um you know cue to engage in action

779
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
but that's not the hard part that's not

780
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,760
really the

781
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,039
heart of the matter next topic so

782
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,360
minimum unifying model of consciousness

783
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
what

784
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,240
what did you find interesting about this

785
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,840
or what did you like about what you

786
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
read i liked this quote

787
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,480
that um i pulled out from from the end

788
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,039
of the

789
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
uh paper like i think it was right

790
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
before the conclusion maybe the end of

791
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,400
section four

792
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,679
that says you know minimizing

793
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,840
variational free energy could count as a

794
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
minimum

795
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
unifying model variational free energy

796
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,559
must be minimized by every

797
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,960
self-organizing system that persists

798
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
and hence also by any conscious system

799
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
i liked that and i thought that it was

800
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,520
applicable and kind of

801
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,960
really right on target

802
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
the challenge is decompiling

803
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,960
so every self-organizing system that

804
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
persists

805
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
are those the conscious systems are

806
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
those two sets the same so

807
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
self-organizing uh storm cloud what is

808
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,919
it like to be a storm cloud what is it

809
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
like to be a volcano

810
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
that's the question of what is it like

811
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
to be a bat and then

812
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,320
um another thread is like the cultural

813
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,720
like

814
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
maybe if there's a prior or something

815
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,200
that's implicit or

816
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
sub-personal that leads us to certain

817
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,480
kinds of

818
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
explanations being just absurd versus

819
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
intuitive like pan psychism versus only

820
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
vertebrates or only

821
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,600
subclasses or or nothing it's like what

822
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
do you mean nothing it's like well just

823
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,760
nothing it's not something i wonder

824
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
about

825
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,799
why not but not not an issue if not

826
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,360
so that's the minimum unifying model

827
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
it's going to come up in the terms of

828
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
this paper just because that's kind of

829
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,880
um both the authors are interested in

830
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,679
that

831
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
i would say and just to go

832
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,760
into one of the prior papers a solo

833
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
author paper by the first author

834
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
um longia so this is the science of

835
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,320
consciousness does not need another

836
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
theory it needs a minimum unifying model

837
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,679
unifying words on 7 11 2020

838
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
great date for pape and here

839
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
are on the right side are referring to

840
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,039
two kind of hypotheses for how we could

841
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
think about different

842
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,159
fields of meaning one way of

843
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
uh arranging different fields would be

844
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
like information generation is

845
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
all these tan things in a so this is

846
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
like computers and random number

847
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,159
generators and die

848
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,039
or something like that and then

849
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,520
consciousness is a subset where maybe

850
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
there's some conscious systems that

851
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
don't generate information maybe there's

852
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
some that do

853
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,320
maybe you have a different feeling about

854
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,559
how these are overlapped like in b

855
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,080
where there's information generating

856
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,159
systems that's a big super class

857
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
and then within that there are systems

858
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
like the blue the non-reflexive behavior

859
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,480
that are

860
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
cybernetic to some extent like it's

861
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
predictive it's acting in a way that

862
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,120
might have

863
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,840
some game theory like or some sort of

864
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
adaptive seeming dynamics

865
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
but consciousness is a subset of that

866
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,960
and so i just really

867
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,120
appreciate the the research direction of

868
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,240
the author

869
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,640
because um the difference between a and

870
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,520
b is

871
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
is night and day and there's many other

872
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,240
options it wasn't an attempt to be

873
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
exhausted it's like

874
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
if we could talk about this we could

875
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
have a better way of framing oh our

876
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
computer's conscious our human and the

877
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,320
computer what's conscious

878
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,960
let's say let's take a step back are we

879
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,840
where who

880
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,919
what are we overlapping with what and

881
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,919
what's on the table here and what kinds

882
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
of words do we care about and where's

883
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
the territory it's okay if territories

884
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,799
are nested within each other or

885
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,919
overlapping

886
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,919
or they're intercalated or they're

887
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,600
they're complementary or something

888
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
but we have to pull back to kind of a

889
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,000
level where we can at least sort through

890
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,159
all these theories of the science of

891
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,279
consciousness

892
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
because otherwise it's just a total mess

893
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
and the information overload aside

894
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,080
it doesn't even make sense just if

895
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,880
everyone's working in their own

896
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
wavelength it doesn't even make sense

897
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
so really nice um direction any thoughts

898
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,799
on that blue

899
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,880
so i wonder if like information

900
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
generation and consciousness like aren't

901
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,159
a full overlap

902
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
like if those can just like be all

903
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
lumped into one of one another and then

904
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
non-reflexive behavior is like some

905
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,159
subset

906
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,360
of that um just just even going to like

907
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
the spin of a of an electron like a

908
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
coupled electron like if you're looking

909
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,120
at

910
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
at qubits right like so it it's always

911
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,360
got to be there's a paired system and is

912
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,240
that conscious

913
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
like just getting down to the very basic

914
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,279
like atomic particles

915
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
especially what we talked about earlier

916
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,120
like if the free energy principle

917
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
is for so-called passive and active

918
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,799
systems that are engaging

919
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,120
with their niche like systems that

920
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,559
aren't usually thought of as very

921
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,440
reactive like

922
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
a proton or like a rock at a larger

923
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,640
scale

924
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
are they on this consciousness continuum

925
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
or are they disjoint from it or

926
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,679
so those are the kinds of things where

927
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,559
reading the paper

928
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,760
helps bring us to the edge of the ideas

929
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
and of research and also to the edges

930
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,679
socially thinking about it and talking

931
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,640
about it hearing people who have

932
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,120
different

933
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,919
perspectives so on the perspectives

934
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,360
issue also

935
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
computational explanations so just in

936
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,600
the word

937
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
what is computation you're going to have

938
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
a lot of takes some people will say

939
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,360
i mean of course you know my linux

940
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
computer right here is a computer

941
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,640
but then they'll say that the hydrogen

942
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
is also a computer and the football when

943
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
it gets kicked it's also computing a

944
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,360
parabola so it's

945
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
computing everything and then what is

946
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
explanation

947
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,080
philosophy of science rabbit hole to go

948
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,960
down

949
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
but um is it about being emotionally

950
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
satisfied with what we know

951
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,799
or is it about being able to usefully

952
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,080
act like do we have an

953
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
explanation for traffic i don't know

954
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,919
maybe some people would say yes no in

955
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,279
this situation yes but

956
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,760
do we have best practices do we have

957
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
approaches

958
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
so explanation versus approaches and

959
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,320
then the last point here

960
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,600
is just thinking especially in the

961
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
biological case about

962
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,840
unconventional computation so let's just

963
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,880
call the turing

964
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,960
von neumann genre the binary state

965
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,679
machine

966
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,720
idea conventional computation

967
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
there's a whole world quite literally of

968
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,799
unconventional

969
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,279
computation so reservoir computing

970
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,159
things that we're going to talk about

971
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
right at the very end

972
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,640
within the binary computers and then

973
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
outside of the binary computers physical

974
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,679
computing

975
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,480
wetware by bray is kind of about moving

976
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,240
beyond software hardware

977
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
distinctions which don't exist in cells

978
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
dna is dna it's not hardware it's not

979
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,320
software it's not source code it's dna

980
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,559
and then leviathan the cover of that

981
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,919
famous work

982
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,279
with a larger the group

983
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,120
made up of the individuals so that kind

984
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
of multi-level systems perspective

985
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,559
on computation multi-level cognition all

986
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,840
of these things come into play when

987
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,720
we're talking about

988
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
computational explanation

989
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,679
so can i just like maybe add a little

990
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,000
bit

991
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
oh yeah i know because i know that this

992
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,279
is one of your chillest areas

993
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
so i just think about explanation like

994
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
what is the

995
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
um like explanation is like the death of

996
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,200
curiosity

997
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
it's like the ultimate like pacification

998
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
like i just explained it to you

999
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,840
therefore

1000
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
shut up like that's why that's your

1001
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,919
answer so i think like

1002
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,320
explanation like we should never be

1003
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
satisfied with any explanation

1004
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
like we should not presume that we

1005
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,519
understand fully

1006
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
like anything because it just ceases

1007
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
investigation at that point

1008
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,080
um and so so i think like you know

1009
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,960
computational

1010
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,320
approximation might be more fun and

1011
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
and lend itself more to deeper

1012
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
scientific explanation

1013
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
yeah one thing that we were talking

1014
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,919
about just like um an hour ago

1015
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,679
with some other people in the lab was

1016
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,120
like if the heart

1017
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
of the issue is how things are realism

1018
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,279
once you get the lossless

1019
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
you know mp3 file the quest for what is

1020
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,720
is done

1021
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
but then if the song is not just the mp3

1022
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
file but it's actually the relationship

1023
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,600
how could you say that that ever ends so

1024
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,640
it's kind of like

1025
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,519
yeah are we looking to engage and to do

1026
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:01,919
things

1027
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,399
in the world and act or are we looking

1028
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,200
to come to

1029
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,279
a satisfying emotional explanation in

1030
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
some

1031
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,399
uh topic all right so

1032
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,600
19. so here we are getting to some of

1033
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,000
the

1034
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,679
details like the computational versus

1035
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,279
the neural correlates of consciousness

1036
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,840
so there's two double c's this is the

1037
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,440
ccc and then the next one is going to be

1038
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,799
the ncc

1039
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,279
so what are the computational correlates

1040
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,080
of consciousness

1041
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,679
what would be your definition

1042
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,279
for ccc so

1043
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,320
like i said i think that the

1044
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
computational correlates of

1045
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,200
consciousness um

1046
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,519
you know it goes back to like is a

1047
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,440
football conscious right like it's input

1048
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,919
output

1049
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,960
so like you know you have you what what

1050
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
goes into the system and what comes out

1051
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,399
of the system

1052
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,720
and and you know is like can we call

1053
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,679
that consciousness

1054
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,919
i don't really know so but but for me

1055
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,360
like my interpretation is

1056
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,200
is it's a decision right like so you

1057
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
have the input you know what you're

1058
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,320
supposed to do or what you think you're

1059
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,279
supposed to do you have some

1060
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,240
approximation

1061
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,760
about what you're supposed to do how

1062
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,880
you're supposed to engage with your

1063
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,080
environment based on the input that

1064
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,960
comes in

1065
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,519
and then you act in accordance with what

1066
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,039
you think you're supposed to do or

1067
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
or what you predict will lead to the

1068
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,559
best outcome

1069
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,360
i don't know something like that yep

1070
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
well

1071
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
the correlate word is suggesting that

1072
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,120
this is

1073
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
not an explanation that's causal

1074
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
correlation is not causation

1075
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,679
as they say so it's like we're talking

1076
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
about correlations we're talking about

1077
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,159
observables

1078
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,760
kind of like a correlation like a

1079
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,279
regression coefficient

1080
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,279
but a little bit probably deeper than

1081
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,480
that and then

1082
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,159
i guess my question for the authors

1083
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,919
would be how is

1084
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,000
this related to the cybernetic

1085
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,840
correlates of consciousness or the cyber

1086
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,120
cybernetic attributes um in the paper

1087
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,640
nine with rudroff and

1088
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
um and other authors it was like there

1089
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,760
was the five

1090
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
functional invariants or something like

1091
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
that like the perceptual invariance

1092
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
so what are these computational

1093
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,120
correlates um

1094
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
and how are they related to algorithmic

1095
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
or cybernetic

1096
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
because maybe the word computer has a

1097
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,800
lot of baggage we're live streaming on a

1098
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,839
computer it's just

1099
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,280
used in a really specific way it's a

1100
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
specific word and then

1101
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
maybe there's another way to think about

1102
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,639
like processural correlates or like the

1103
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,599
informational correlates of

1104
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,359
consciousness that might be a little bit

1105
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,639
um different aspect of what they're

1106
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,719
showing but the details of what they're

1107
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,000
showing we'll get to

1108
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,639
all right ncc so the neural coral is a

1109
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
consciousness it's another

1110
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,839
correlate question so we're looking for

1111
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,280
neural things that correlate with

1112
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
consciousness so first off correlation

1113
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,879
causation again

1114
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,480
and the correlation can be like

1115
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,119
evolutionary like we think that this

1116
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,599
brain region over the breadth of species

1117
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,960
diversity is correlated with

1118
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,399
consciousness or it's correlated with

1119
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,599
this behavior

1120
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
or the correlation can be like a

1121
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,719
molecular thing

1122
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,280
or it can be a dynamical pattern this

1123
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
fmri pattern or this eeg pattern

1124
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
is a correlative consciousness we set

1125
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,359
them up so that it was an experiment

1126
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,079
where in

1127
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,839
this task they did have consciousness

1128
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,119
and this one they didn't

1129
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,640
so it gets into defining consciousness

1130
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
but they say the difference between

1131
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,520
these two conditions is the neural

1132
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,720
correlated consciousness

1133
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
or the difference between patients in

1134
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
this category versus patients in this

1135
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,200
category is this

1136
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,400
and for two takes on the issue um in

1137
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
2016

1138
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,200
um christoph koch at all um talked about

1139
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,520
like

1140
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,320
from their pro neural correlate of

1141
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,839
consciousness agenda

1142
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,520
direction what were the problems and

1143
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,079
progress

1144
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,760
in their fields and then here's a paper

1145
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
from 2010 2019 with me

1146
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
and a colleague where we kind of took a

1147
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
step back from just thinking about the

1148
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,480
neural correlates

1149
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
and thought okay what about for the ant

1150
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
colony or for other systems that aren't

1151
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,640
just

1152
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,920
like set up like the mammalian brain

1153
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,160
how would we think about consciousness

1154
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,680
because if you study only the neural

1155
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,800
correlates consciousness

1156
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
you're studying how would you know that

1157
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,599
that's actually the subset of systems

1158
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,040
it's like you're shining a spotlight

1159
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,880
maybe a good one maybe a distorted one

1160
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
on the neural system

1161
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,920
but what if it's not just neural it's

1162
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,599
glial oh well of course i meant that

1163
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:03,920
okay

1164
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,359
what if it's neural and the body oh yeah

1165
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,040
i meant that too so all of a sudden

1166
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
okay now you're talking about neural in

1167
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,960
the niche and that's why we're talking

1168
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,800
about multi-scale systems

1169
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
so that's what there's a lot of

1170
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520
interesting stuff happening here and

1171
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,359
about how the fep and multi-scale

1172
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,160
approaches

1173
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,520
fit together with the more neural

1174
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,680
focus and the more certain time scales

1175
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
and certain neural signatures

1176
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,599
that avenue of research in neuroscience

1177
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,320
humans

1178
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,000
sensu strictdo now connecting it to a

1179
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
clearly very vast area what do you think

1180
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,040
about that blue

1181
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,760
um so i think that the neural

1182
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
correlative consciousness is cool i

1183
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:41,920
think that

1184
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,079
um like they do the fmri study like when

1185
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,680
you're asleep versus when you're awake

1186
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,040
and then they take like the difference

1187
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
that's like a common way that they like

1188
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
estimate

1189
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
the neural covalets of consciousness

1190
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,960
um there's also like the hyper

1191
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
consciousness like

1192
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,359
um who's i can't remember the author

1193
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
um but he did like the information

1194
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,760
theory like aspect of like psychedelics

1195
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,000
so like expanded consciousness like what

1196
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,599
does expanded consciousness look like

1197
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,640
and how like there's

1198
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,040
more connections between uh neurons i'll

1199
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,400
have to remember the name of that paper

1200
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,440
for next time

1201
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,839
um but but it's it's just uh the neural

1202
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:18,800
correlation of

1203
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,839
of consciousness was really done by

1204
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,240
differentials

1205
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,280
that's a common thing i think yes

1206
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
exactly it's an experimental way to get

1207
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,480
at

1208
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,960
using measurements real data real

1209
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,320
experimental setups the kinds of things

1210
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,880
that exist

1211
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
in neuroscience labs getting at

1212
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
questions of consciousness

1213
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,240
and the question is are we are we on the

1214
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,079
right track or might be misled by the

1215
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,680
tools we have available and approaches

1216
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,400
we have

1217
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
so 21 islands of awareness okay so this

1218
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
is kind of a topic that i'd never

1219
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,640
heard about it's from a recent paper by

1220
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,119
bain

1221
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,480
at all 2020 and so we're thinking about

1222
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
kind of the fringe cases or the areas

1223
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
where we might be able to have a unique

1224
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,079
prediction or an explanation

1225
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
that is going to be a value add for the

1226
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,119
fep

1227
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,800
in thinking about neuroscience and

1228
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,119
consciousness or which systems are going

1229
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,800
to be useful to think about

1230
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,160
uh even if other systems also agree and

1231
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
there's going to be this case proposed

1232
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,359
like a thought experiment called the

1233
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,720
island of awareness

1234
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
which is a conscious stream so i don't

1235
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
know is the rabbit already in the hat

1236
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,359
it's a conscious stream or system whose

1237
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,119
contents are not shaped by sensory input

1238
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,880
from either the external world or the

1239
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
body and which cannot be expressed via

1240
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
motor output

1241
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
now one could just say well but what if

1242
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
the body's part of the whole conscious

1243
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,200
system so it's

1244
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
it's a kind of non-sequitur to say well

1245
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,720
it's happening in the brain ergo you can

1246
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
cut that out

1247
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,960
maybe you can maybe you can't but by

1248
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
looking at the paper

1249
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,720
and by believing that the authors have

1250
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
thought through what they wrote like

1251
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,800
it's always a useful starting point for

1252
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,839
discussion

1253
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,680
so the fringe and the edge cases can be

1254
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,800
where we start to see theory

1255
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,160
differentiation

1256
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,240
so if this thought experiment isn't very

1257
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,359
interesting to you you'll probably find

1258
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,240
another one that

1259
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,680
might be but these are like we're

1260
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
looking for the exceptions that prove

1261
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,920
the rule

1262
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
or the um sort of higher level

1263
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
game that is revealed by us over

1264
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,000
sampling

1265
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,160
just one area of state space the issue

1266
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,599
with thought experiments though is

1267
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,960
well kind of like science fiction they

1268
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
can provide inspiration if they're

1269
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,839
um at the right place the right time

1270
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,200
you're never gonna reach these ideal

1271
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,920
situations

1272
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,280
and they often have a huge amount of

1273
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
assumptions built in and then even for

1274
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
uh there's this dream of empirical

1275
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,280
application oh we'll study the island of

1276
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,079
awareness then

1277
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,599
because it's such a great thought system

1278
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,359
and there's a hundred papers on publish

1279
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:33,839
on it

1280
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,720
but then it even for a close case like

1281
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,040
oh

1282
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
maybe in this medical condition there

1283
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,400
locked-in syndrome

1284
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
it ends up that it's not exactly what

1285
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,920
people want and so then

1286
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,000
it goes into a really protracted

1287
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,520
multi-year thing with just

1288
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
is the system the right one to test this

1289
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
thought experiment short answer

1290
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,880
no and it's hard to know what to do with

1291
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,640
real systems to really make a dent in

1292
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,599
the consciousness problem

1293
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,200
any thoughts on that um

1294
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,440
just that uh you know the islands of

1295
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
awareness i think

1296
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,240
um are always there's always going to be

1297
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,079
those exceptions to the rule or those

1298
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,599
hard cases like we don't even really

1299
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
know how to

1300
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
get at consciousness in a system like

1301
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,480
that like a brain and a dish model

1302
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,839
is there consciousness in that like i

1303
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,440
remember working in the lab and growing

1304
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,160
cells

1305
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
in my like petri dish or whatever they

1306
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,680
were growing in and like

1307
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,720
you know i i was like i wonder what my

1308
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,319
culture is thinking or if they're

1309
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,359
thinking like

1310
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,640
i would be like doing neuronal

1311
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
differentiation and be like you know

1312
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
i just wonder like what they're thinking

1313
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,319
about today so so i mean it's just

1314
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,480
it's always like this mystery so we

1315
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
don't really know if there's if we can

1316
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
approximate consciousness in a system

1317
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
like that also uh the author

1318
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
of the information theory and

1319
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,520
psychedelic paper is andrew gallimore

1320
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,720
is his name sorry cool yeah it's um

1321
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
and again like how does philosophical

1322
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,000
uncertainty

1323
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,800
or debate propagate through basic

1324
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
research and application

1325
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
um what about with organoid research on

1326
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,839
neural cultures and so

1327
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,359
is there a certain size of brain or what

1328
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,119
about there's a brain in a body or you

1329
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
recapitulated something from a

1330
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
stem cell from a neuron and from a you

1331
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
know skin cell or you made some new cell

1332
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,359
type it's like

1333
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,839
is it different or worse or better to

1334
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,240
throw a gallon of skin cells versus a

1335
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
gallon of this type of cell

1336
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,160
those are big questions and that's why

1337
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
the consciousness discussion is really

1338
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,319
important

1339
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,359
to not just resolve but to sort of like

1340
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,720
clarify and to engage with so the big

1341
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,520
picture

1342
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,440
of this paper now to get into the

1343
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,119
quotes and some of the key topics we're

1344
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,480
not going to go through every quote

1345
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,359
we're not going to read every quote

1346
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:35,839
because there's

1347
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,520
a bunch of quotes but this section

1348
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
is going to just describe the main

1349
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,280
three observations that link three of

1350
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,000
the big

1351
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,319
tlas three-letter acronyms together so

1352
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,680
fep is the big one

1353
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,119
but then we have the neural and the

1354
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,319
computational correlates of

1355
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,119
consciousness

1356
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,119
so they're all kind of gonna be joined

1357
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,319
together

1358
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,200
and just to read the first point of each

1359
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,560
one

1360
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,720
if we're going to go fep neural

1361
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,839
correlates should be in terms of

1362
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,160
neurodynamics not neural states

1363
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,960
so in other words patterns of neural

1364
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,800
systems through space and time

1365
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,720
not just like up the jennifer aniston

1366
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,920
neuron fired

1367
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,760
so they were conscious of jennifer

1368
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,359
aniston it's going to have to move a

1369
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,640
little bit beyond that

1370
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,480
into something that's about dynamics

1371
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
through state spaces

1372
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560
this second point is that there are

1373
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
relevant distinctions to be made

1374
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,800
between the probabilities of movements

1375
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
through this neural state space

1376
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,640
and the probabilities encoded by neural

1377
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
states

1378
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,720
that's going into a whole encoding

1379
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
representation question

1380
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,960
and a lot of statistical details if that

1381
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,920
sounds interesting

1382
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
read it and then the third point is that

1383
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,200
some

1384
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,440
of the computational correlates

1385
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,720
literature

1386
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,160
are able to be recast

1387
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,800
within the fvp and so the fep is going

1388
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,079
to be like a bridge

1389
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,160
or like a nexus between people have

1390
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,319
identified 10 computational correlates

1391
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,400
and 10 neural correlates well you got

1392
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,319
this blood signal in the

1393
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,680
this brain region when they see this

1394
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,359
thing in this auditory region when they

1395
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,240
hear this thing and

1396
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,079
this when they remember themselves and

1397
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,440
then on the computational side you have

1398
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,000
this feature

1399
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,079
a b c d all the stuff like information

1400
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,680
theory how are we going to bring them

1401
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,839
together fep

1402
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,040
any thoughts blue all right no

1403
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,119
so let's go through kind of with a

1404
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,480
little i don't think we kept the exact

1405
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,359
order of the paper

1406
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,520
but early in the paper we start from the

1407
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,960
neural correlates of consciousness which

1408
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,599
is something that

1409
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,040
people have at least probably thought of

1410
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
like there's something different when

1411
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,800
there's

1412
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
blood loss to the brain than the hand so

1413
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,839
people have kind of thought that there's

1414
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,040
a neural correlate

1415
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,960
of consciousness we're going to move the

1416
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,800
discussion from just thinking about

1417
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
neural correlates to computational

1418
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
correlates so this is the

1419
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,319
narrative trajectory from being like

1420
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:49,359
neuroreductionist or centric

1421
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,599
to more computational perspective they

1422
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,960
say ccc

1423
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,640
computational correlates are more

1424
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,920
general and promise to be more

1425
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,200
explanatory than neural

1426
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
correlates but there's also challenges

1427
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,119
so big benefits that you get you can

1428
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,280
consider ant colonies and ecosystems all

1429
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,560
kinds of cool stuff and

1430
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
perhaps have access to a whole new set

1431
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
of computational tools

1432
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,160
downside are what

1433
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,079
computational correlates are not defined

1434
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
in terms of neural structures

1435
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,359
but are neutral with respect to the

1436
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,880
question of whether the conscious

1437
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
experience correlates with global neural

1438
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
activity or not

1439
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,960
so the issue is that the brain is

1440
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,119
changing state all at once

1441
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,680
and so you don't know whether that one

1442
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,359
feature you isolated is really the

1443
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,960
difference that makes a difference

1444
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,359
so to speak it's like you could run two

1445
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,400
different computers and you wouldn't

1446
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:34,960
really know

1447
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
what about their outcomes from a

1448
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
correlated perspective

1449
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,440
was the actual explanation so one part

1450
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,480
is it's hard to get

1451
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,000
an explanation even though they say it's

1452
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,520
more explanatory

1453
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,040
um and then basically

1454
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,800
the second challenge for the

1455
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,560
computational correlates

1456
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,119
is the mapping from any correlate to

1457
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,480
consciousness

1458
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,720
especially in controversial cases and

1459
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,560
the third challenge for any correlate of

1460
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,359
consciousness

1461
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,000
is basically fringe cases and cases we

1462
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,200
don't know or don't

1463
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
but even those who knows what we do and

1464
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,760
don't know so

1465
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,079
there's these are three of the major

1466
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,680
dimensions

1467
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
of the challenge for any correlate of

1468
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,880
consciousness

1469
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,920
global versus local structure

1470
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,880
mapping between um consciousness and any

1471
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,560
correlate

1472
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
arbitrarily or not and then cases we

1473
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,599
don't know or understand

1474
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,800
so there's big territory that's

1475
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
pretty open and there's a lot there what

1476
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,960
do you think about that

1477
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
there's a lot there's a lot of remains

1478
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,960
to be you know elucidated

1479
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,640
in all of those um areas so

1480
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,319
yep our problem yep so 24. so yeah

1481
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,359
kind of taking computational just

1482
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,680
at the author's word that's how that's

1483
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,800
the thread they tie

1484
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,400
so it's a broader understanding than

1485
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,720
just i think a computer processor i hope

1486
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,839
that we'll

1487
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,680
find that out especially when we talk to

1488
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,079
the authors so there's a generality of

1489
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,520
these computational principles but they

1490
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,280
also have a disadvantage

1491
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
the properties described by them may not

1492
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
be necessary for many types of conscious

1493
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,240
experience but probably not sufficient

1494
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,920
so probably it's a probabilistic

1495
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,359
statement but do we know what is

1496
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,560
sufficient

1497
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,760
and so in other words what is required

1498
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,480
for consciousness that's sort of the

1499
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,160
issue with this computational approach

1500
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,800
is

1501
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,200
you get this general toolkit that can

1502
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,119
cross scales really easily say wait if i

1503
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,560
can make a measurement of a millimeter

1504
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,160
in a measurement of kilometers

1505
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,040
and then i can use um my tools on

1506
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,000
numbers

1507
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,160
then it's a multi-scale model right and

1508
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,280
so the challenge is

1509
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,480
have you underspecified aspects of the

1510
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,440
system

1511
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,280
leading to a really um potentially uh

1512
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,599
like bad false positive or false

1513
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,800
negative rate

1514
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,480
of course the question is what is the

1515
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
ground truth who's ground truth

1516
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,680
and how are we going to get to these

1517
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,440
edge cases and resolve them in a real

1518
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,119
finite world

1519
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,440
and then the authors say in order to

1520
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,800
address this question

1521
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,960
of what is necessary and sufficient we

1522
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,079
show that

1523
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,359
we show to what extent and from what

1524
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,720
assumptions some computational

1525
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,000
principles can be derived from first

1526
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,520
principles

1527
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,359
so they're going to say all right this

1528
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
even the computational correlates of

1529
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,000
consciousness people yes there's some

1530
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,920
issues with going computationalists but

1531
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,319
we have studied those this is good

1532
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,119
phrasing

1533
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,520
then we're going to ask how even the

1534
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,880
computational correlates could be

1535
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,280
themselves generated from an underlying

1536
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,440
something first first principles which

1537
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,640
are going to be information

1538
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,760
and physical principles as we are seeing

1539
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,800
what do you think about that so i mean i

1540
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,440
think

1541
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
in order to delineate what's required

1542
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,520
for consciousness you need to kind of

1543
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,640
get at the point of what is

1544
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,880
consciousness like and i think that you

1545
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,200
know

1546
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,079
they artfully skate past that in the

1547
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,599
paper and i mean i don't blame them

1548
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,319
right like

1549
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,680
it's a it's a touchy um and

1550
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,079
difficult and many gray areas you know

1551
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,440
exist within trying to define

1552
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,040
consciousness but if you can't define

1553
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
what is consciousness how can you

1554
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,520
define the requirements for

1555
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,119
consciousness yep

1556
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,559
agreed and so let's uh see what any of

1557
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,640
the authors have to say on that but

1558
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,200
this is the question how is

1559
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,800
computational principles or physical

1560
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,559
principles going to come into play

1561
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,920
all right here we go into the formalism

1562
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,280
section there's a bunch of formalisms in

1563
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
the paper

1564
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,160
and um here is just one from the paper

1565
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,280
starting on the top left

1566
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,839
that sites out to a fristen paper this

1567
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,160
first in 2019 long monograph that is

1568
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,960
having many

1569
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
active uh improvements and revisions

1570
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,319
and discussions on it and then here's

1571
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,440
two sections from

1572
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,359
this first in 2019 paper from 12 and 13

1573
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:43,839
i think

1574
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,240
but really you could take it even back

1575
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,480
further just like any other literature

1576
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,240
you kind of take it back as far as you

1577
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,680
want to learn

1578
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,079
but for the purposes of the top left the

1579
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,440
paper that we're

1580
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,640
reading today the key formalism

1581
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,359
is here or one of the key formulas just

1582
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,119
the one on this slide

1583
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,400
we're going to express the flow of f

1584
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
in terms of surprisal and hence in terms

1585
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,880
of a non-equilibrium steady state

1586
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,000
density

1587
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,599
expressing the flow f in terms of

1588
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,760
surprisal is almost like

1589
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,079
thinking about surprisal like it were a

1590
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,040
flow

1591
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,640
so just like you could have a flow of

1592
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,480
water we're thinking about

1593
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,200
kind of surprisal flows which is to say

1594
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
using flow

1595
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,200
like dynamics to study surprisal because

1596
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,680
that's

1597
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,079
all sort of a few different facets of

1598
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,359
the same thing

1599
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,800
and so there's going to be some flow

1600
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,839
that's going to reflect

1601
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,920
some terms that can be rewritten a few

1602
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,119
different ways we're not going to go

1603
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,960
down all the details i think of every

1604
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,280
letter anything that we should add on

1605
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,640
this slide

1606
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,800
blue but this is just about the idea of

1607
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,960
expressing information as a flow

1608
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,720
which is going to set us up for some of

1609
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,280
these later discussions and formalisms

1610
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,880
yeah no i'm good yep and we just throw

1611
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,160
these slides

1612
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,839
uh in the order just that we

1613
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,119
snap them so there's other orders and

1614
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:11,680
other

1615
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,400
ways of going through it we had to look

1616
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,559
up a ton of stuff we learned that the uh

1617
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,800
i'm gonna bring this on the dell or the

1618
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,680
nabla

1619
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,760
it's the operator used in mathematics

1620
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,640
particularly vector calculus

1621
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,200
that is a vector differential so it's

1622
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,760
like div

1623
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,079
grad curl but it's it's an upside down

1624
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,839
triangle but it does have to do with

1625
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:32,319
change

1626
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,520
just like a regular delta but it's a

1627
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,319
whole area

1628
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,800
of math and so this is just to say some

1629
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,599
people

1630
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,599
maybe they didn't expect an equation in

1631
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,040
a consciousness paper

1632
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,440
other people maybe they're very familiar

1633
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,160
with this math

1634
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
and applying it to consciousness seems

1635
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,359
like an outrageous

1636
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,480
overstep so that's the conversation

1637
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
yeah if you're somewhere in the middle

1638
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,680
like

1639
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,359
i think i'm i'm somewhere in the middle

1640
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,200
of that um but but if you're somewhere

1641
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,920
in the middle

1642
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,079
just knowing that it's like about

1643
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,920
information geometries like how daniel's

1644
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,520
mentioning it's about a flow and so

1645
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,280
so when you have like it's it's a

1646
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,359
geometry like the probabilities are

1647
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,800
thought about in these shape

1648
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,079
spaces and kind of knowing that helps to

1649
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,119
contextualize

1650
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,119
uh the way that it moves i think you

1651
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,720
know thinking of float it all makes me

1652
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,280
think of like

1653
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,440
a program it's all set up and loaded

1654
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,599
which files to read in what to analyze

1655
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,559
you hit enter

1656
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,480
it's like a bunch of grain in a silo and

1657
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,160
you pull out

1658
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,559
the stopper and then it flows because

1659
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,079
there are forces so the computer is

1660
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,920
having energy course through it

1661
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,839
and there's certain irreversible

1662
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,200
processes that

1663
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,319
increment a flow of information

1664
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,720
and so there's that's kind of i wonder

1665
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,160
what kinds of metaphors like this could

1666
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,240
be something for the author like

1667
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,520
how do we think about this flow and

1668
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
where how how do we what how can we

1669
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,520
describe it and learn about it

1670
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,559
so this is another this is so yeah that

1671
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,040
maybe

1672
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
this one could have gone before the

1673
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,079
other one but

1674
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,200
this is um a pretty general framing

1675
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,680
of random dynamical systems that are

1676
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,480
using this

1677
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,520
langvain formalism that was developed in

1678
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,480
the direction

1679
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
of free energy principle by

1680
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,520
ao 2008 and other authors

1681
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,160
and basically we can read this bottom

1682
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,359
part go back to the equation so the

1683
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,480
state of the system

1684
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,520
x of t at time t tau

1685
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,760
is constituted by slowly changing

1686
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,680
macroscopic variables

1687
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,599
which are grounded in microscopic

1688
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,240
variables with faster dynamics

1689
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,119
so it's almost like saying little things

1690
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,640
are composed

1691
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,800
of littler things little things compose

1692
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,240
bigger things so it's kind of

1693
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,520
allowing us to go multi-scale by saying

1694
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,440
that there's going to be a sort of big

1695
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,200
wave and a ripple

1696
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,359
and a bunch of the ripples summating

1697
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,400
makes the big wave

1698
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,559
informationally just kind of like a

1699
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,920
bunch of physical things

1700
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,800
spatially compose a bigger thing but

1701
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,559
this is happening

1702
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,200
through time as a random dynamical

1703
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,480
system

1704
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,559
not with a spatial metaphor so think

1705
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,839
about little things assembling into

1706
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,800
bigger things

1707
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,319
and then pour it out of the physical

1708
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,480
into the dynamical systems

1709
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,720
and it's what kind of a dynamical system

1710
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,559
it could be related to information

1711
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,319
this is why the result is a stochastic

1712
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,680
differential equation

1713
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,359
comprising not only the state-dependent

1714
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,040
flow f

1715
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,839
but also a stochastic term omega with a

1716
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,119
mean equal to zero

1717
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,640
so another way of thinking about this is

1718
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,640
like signal and noise

1719
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,800
and so it's all like the vibration but

1720
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,920
you can partition it

1721
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,359
with a model into change through time

1722
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,319
of a signal and a noise that's like much

1723
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,520
higher frequency

1724
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,800
so that noise it's not like you're

1725
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,040
saying it's like bad it's just that

1726
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,520
with the signal that you're pulling out

1727
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,800
it's the residual

1728
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
and the signals that are hard to find

1729
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,000
are the ones that are shorter like

1730
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,839
they're hiding in the noise

1731
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,200
but those can be pulled out if you have

1732
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,480
a really long time series you can

1733
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,599
totally pull it out

1734
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,520
and there's other signals where the

1735
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,599
signal is so strong and then the noise

1736
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,440
is so tiny like the vibration

1737
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,160
an inch off of the orbit of a planet

1738
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,599
it's like really easy to pull out the

1739
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,400
signal

1740
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,680
because the noise term is so small so

1741
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,520
any thoughts on that blue or we can

1742
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,720
continue all right

1743
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,680
so now we want to talk about what exists

1744
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,680
which is related to fristen's theory of

1745
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,800
every

1746
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,839
quote thing or of um particular physics

1747
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:24,480
which is

1748
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,079
a specific way of doing physics and it's

1749
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,000
a physics of particles

1750
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,440
anything that exists will have

1751
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,800
characteristic features that do not

1752
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,480
change over time

1753
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,559
this is like measured theory it's like

1754
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,599
if it's

1755
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,400
not there through time it doesn't exist

1756
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,839
like the reason why there isn't it's

1757
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:40,559
kind of like

1758
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,359
um material costs like if there isn't a

1759
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:43,839
cow

1760
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,000
in my room it's just not there something

1761
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,960
doesn't persist

1762
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,400
it's not there formally we express this

1763
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,440
by assuming

1764
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,280
that the system is a random dynamical

1765
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,000
system in non-equilibrium steady state

1766
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,359
so the equilibrium the total heat death

1767
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,440
equilibrium steady state of the air

1768
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,559
molecules in the room

1769
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,920
would be dispersed to homogeneity with

1770
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,559
some

1771
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,400
summary statistic like the well

1772
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,079
mixedness but if it's not

1773
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,480
at equilibrium to the well-mixedness

1774
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,119
physically

1775
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,680
or kind of informationally then it's an

1776
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
in a non-equilibrium steady state

1777
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,760
the steady-state part is because of

1778
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,960
existing through time

1779
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,119
like the length of your arm but then the

1780
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,960
non-equilibrium part is reflecting that

1781
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,000
the arm is an

1782
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,040
organization beyond just dissipating

1783
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,280
air molecules so when you have a

1784
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,599
non-equilibrium steady state like an arm

1785
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,760
that's persisting despite being

1786
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,520
disordered surrounding

1787
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,880
this means that the system is exchanging

1788
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,480
with its environment and its dynamics

1789
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,319
can be described in terms of its nest's

1790
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,920
probability density

1791
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,680
i.e a probability density that does not

1792
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,280
change during the time over which the

1793
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,960
system is said to exist

1794
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,799
so over the second to the second time

1795
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,880
scale there's a constant measurement on

1796
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,319
the length of the arm and through time

1797
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,520
it could be modeled as something

1798
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,240
changing

1799
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,160
but in all those cases it's like

1800
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,359
definitely not just

1801
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,920
um something that's there's something

1802
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,119
different about what that system is

1803
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:03,680
doing

1804
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,839
informationally relative to other

1805
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:06,799
systems

1806
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,960
okay and then the third kind of quote

1807
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,119
section here is

1808
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,119
such a system has a random attractor

1809
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,640
which could be thought of in two ways or

1810
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,079
another way to say that would be you can

1811
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,920
think about systems as having a random

1812
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,440
attractor which then has multiple

1813
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,280
downstream consequences

1814
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,119
first it can be considered as a

1815
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,480
trajectory of systemic states that

1816
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,160
evolve through time

1817
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,559
so then in this sense the system will

1818
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,240
after sufficient time revisit particular

1819
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,680
regions of a state space

1820
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,760
the attracting set so we've talked on

1821
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,960
the active stream before about like

1822
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,440
returning to a desired body temperature

1823
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
so it's not that your body returns to

1824
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,440
the state that it was as a body

1825
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,319
a week ago a year ago 10 years ago it's

1826
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,040
that

1827
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,599
on that one dimension with respect to

1828
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,520
the modeling of the signal and noise of

1829
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,200
body temperature through time

1830
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,720
because you're staying warmer than the

1831
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,400
background for a persistent amount of

1832
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,040
time

1833
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,760
in a way that defies the otherwise uh

1834
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,640
dis

1835
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,240
dissolving forces of uh thermodynamics

1836
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,079
you can model that like it's doing some

1837
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,920
sort of strange attractor

1838
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,920
that's what that part is saying and then

1839
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,960
the second part

1840
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,640
is that you can think about that as not

1841
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,079
just you can take a trajectory

1842
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,119
view like a single path through stat

1843
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,480
state space temperature going up in the

1844
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,839
morning or down in the morning

1845
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,520
but the other way is like when you have

1846
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,200
a million paths in infinite number of

1847
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,680
paths

1848
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,160
it's like a density and in fact it's a

1849
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,680
flow density so it's like

1850
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,760
one traffic you're driving that's like

1851
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,960
one car

1852
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,839
but then there's the traffic flow and so

1853
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,319
when you switch from a particle

1854
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,839
modeling to a flow modeling is

1855
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,440
there's a lot of it's kind of like

1856
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,520
discrete versus continuous time

1857
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,920
but it's a spatial analog whether you go

1858
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,280
particular like an electron as a

1859
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,960
particle electron is a wave

1860
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,640
how do you make that distinction and so

1861
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,880
that these are all kind of related

1862
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,040
topics but that's what is under the

1863
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,000
scope of

1864
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,559
the pulling back to thinking this way

1865
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,760
anything else all right 27

1866
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,319
the fact that internal states are

1867
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,760
conditionally independent of external

1868
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,240
states

1869
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,480
given blanket states allows us to

1870
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,240
disentangle systems dynamics so now

1871
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,599
we're going to talk about the interfaces

1872
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
between those active interesting systems

1873
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,480
and their otherwise disordering

1874
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,319
environments relatively speaking

1875
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,079
or whatever their other side is whatever

1876
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,920
the other side of the interface is

1877
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,000
um in other words we can write down

1878
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,200
separate equations of motions for the

1879
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,960
internal states and active states

1880
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,599
that only depend on the blanket states

1881
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,040
so there's a couple things happening

1882
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,440
here we're going from this active agent

1883
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,599
model through pearl's work

1884
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,680
building on bayesian statistics and

1885
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,200
markov blankets talked about other

1886
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,319
places other people

1887
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,960
can have a lot more to say on that

1888
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,000
adding

1889
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,240
as per mel andrews's paper the

1890
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,680
innovation of fristin

1891
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,599
which is the partitioning of blanket

1892
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,599
states into sensory in action

1893
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,599
so sensory as being defined as inbound

1894
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,040
and active as being defined as

1895
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,760
outbound and then we're gonna take this

1896
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,319
sort of like equations of motion

1897
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,240
trajectory flow remix

1898
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,200
and think about that kind of a physical

1899
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,960
depiction of a system

1900
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,520
with the partitioning between now two

1901
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,319
flows like a

1902
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,119
highway with two directions so here was

1903
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,000
just like

1904
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,880
landscape flow like the elevation is is

1905
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,400
a flow in one way

1906
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,960
it's kind of just its own flow the water

1907
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,000
flow but then

1908
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,920
here we're gonna have two directions in

1909
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,760
a way it's not just up and down hill but

1910
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,000
it's

1911
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
like there's a sense flow and an action

1912
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,240
flow so there's information coming in

1913
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,000
that might have an asymmetry and then

1914
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,599
there might be like a totally disjoint

1915
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,440
kind of asymmetry with respect to action

1916
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,319
going out

1917
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,960
so if it has a robot has a photon sensor

1918
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,000
and then it has a

1919
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,200
physical actuator this is going to allow

1920
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,520
a total obvious really simple

1921
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,760
partitioning yeah photon come in

1922
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,400
actuator go out generative model

1923
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,440
internal

1924
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,680
maybe i know that fully like a state

1925
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,559
machine

1926
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,000
maybe i'm modeling it like the

1927
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,559
intentional stance but by partitioning

1928
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,280
into

1929
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,040
sensory input and then the motor the

1930
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,359
behavioral experimental output

1931
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,520
we're going to be able to kind of like

1932
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,559
tidy our

1933
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,720
thought around interfacing with active

1934
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,040
systems and even inactive systems

1935
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,079
and then formally that's defined as

1936
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,839
um being a flow so that's this f

1937
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,000
is going to be a function of policy

1938
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,280
which is like the agent's

1939
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,799
you know it is the policy of your arm to

1940
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,720
be the length it is just like it's the

1941
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,920
policy of someone to wear the clothes

1942
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,119
that they wear

1943
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,559
and then it's going to be over um

1944
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:37,839
there's going to be this is not from the

1945
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,160
same paper but formally there are ways

1946
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,520
to define these different states and

1947
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,000
partition

1948
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
them and it's an area of active research

1949
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and discussion which formalisms apply

1950
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,280
over which

1951
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,280
scope and how well all of these

1952
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,799
innovations of first ones line up

1953
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,440
with all the other thoughts in the area

1954
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,160
anything on

1955
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,760
markov blankets or this kind of

1956
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,079
partitioning

1957
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,359
so something i've been thinking about

1958
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,040
like while you've been talking and just

1959
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,720
a metaphor that keeps popping up for me

1960
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,280
is like a

1961
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,559
a ski resort right like with the input

1962
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,160
information coming in and like depending

1963
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,760
on your policy you might select like a

1964
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,000
black

1965
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,720
diamond or a blue diamond or bunny hill

1966
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,599
like slope

1967
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,599
and the flow of people going out and

1968
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,119
then there's like the people that like a

1969
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,799
high level of surprisal that like want

1970
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,400
to ski back country and like possibly

1971
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,079
hit a tree or

1972
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,599
like there's all of this like you know

1973
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,599
all of these options um that's kind of

1974
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,680
how it's been coming together in my

1975
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,799
brain yep i the ski slope people have

1976
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,160
different affordances

1977
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,599
different preferences different risk

1978
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,720
tolerances different um inclination for

1979
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,960
nostalgia of a simple one versus the

1980
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,319
thrill of a new one it's like

1981
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,839
these are all it's kind of like what

1982
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,200
ryan smith has been talked about like

1983
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,240
these are

1984
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,640
above the level of just one repeated

1985
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,280
task that

1986
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,720
two people could perform and oh there's

1987
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,400
a difference in how they performed

1988
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,520
we're looking at something that's

1989
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,440
actually internal about those higher

1990
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,559
order properties

1991
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,839
all right here is where we go from the

1992
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,200
flow state

1993
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,599
across an interface so we have this

1994
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,680
bi-directional freeway

1995
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,280
um with the flow that's partitioned so

1996
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,039
we got like signal processing dynamics

1997
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,720
on the inbound and all the bayesian

1998
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,680
statistics

1999
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,160
that kind of interfaces with all the

2000
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,559
cybernetics and the policy selection

2001
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,039
and then output is behavior so that's

2002
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,880
the bi-directional flow

2003
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,720
across an interface we can

2004
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,599
um use okay let's read this quote and

2005
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,000
then

2006
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,559
unpack these um equations and then read

2007
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:29,280
them

2008
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,799
if the probability distribution q of mu

2009
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,359
q sub mu is sufficiently similar to the

2010
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,480
actual conditional

2011
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,760
distribution p of uh i think it might be

2012
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,240
eta

2013
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,919
but i i don't know it looks like an n

2014
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,200
yeah curly n given

2015
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,880
pi policy so p of of um the actual

2016
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,400
we'll just call it actual yeah actual

2017
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,400
fancy one so if the probability

2018
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,920
distribution you know q

2019
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,640
of fancy n is sufficiently similar to

2020
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,240
the actual conditional

2021
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,200
distribution p of n given policy so

2022
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,039
states given policy how things will turn

2023
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:07,440
out

2024
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,480
given how i act over external states

2025
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,559
how will the external states be given my

2026
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,680
investing strategy

2027
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,680
what will stimuli will i see on my

2028
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,720
website

2029
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,160
in under different policy assumptions um

2030
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,799
then we can approximate that flow so if

2031
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,559
you're treading water

2032
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,799
some motor pattern is being enacted

2033
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,559
that's resulting in treading water

2034
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,960
it's not accidental so that is

2035
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,079
self-organization

2036
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,480
in a dissipating environment and so it's

2037
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,119
as if

2038
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,200
a system that's treading water is able

2039
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,599
to approximate the flow of the actual

2040
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,319
states informationally it can stay above

2041
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:42,799
water

2042
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,480
informationally so it has to be doing

2043
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,400
something like swimming

2044
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,760
equivalently we can say that the

2045
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,760
gradient flow of autonomous states can

2046
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,280
be considered as a gradient flow on

2047
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,160
variational

2048
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,359
free energy so now we move

2049
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,319
from the sort of general computational

2050
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,520
phrasing or physical

2051
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,799
computational phrasing of gradient flows

2052
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,480
into gradient flows being related to

2053
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,799
this variational free energy estimate

2054
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,760
which it turns out is going to allow um

2055
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,160
very

2056
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,039
easy like tractable optimization based

2057
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:15,520
upon

2058
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,160
minimizing variational free energy so

2059
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,799
the

2060
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,680
phrasing of a gradient flow was sort of

2061
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,039
neutral with respect to what you did

2062
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,920
with it

2063
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,640
now by porting the gradient flow into

2064
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,559
gradients of variational free energy it

2065
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,319
opens up a domain of optimization which

2066
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,839
is based upon variational

2067
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,400
bayes and variational free energy and

2068
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,520
just to skip to this

2069
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,280
bottom line the variational free energy

2070
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,079
so this thing

2071
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,640
that it looks as if it's optimizing with

2072
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,079
respect to policy

2073
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,520
big f of pi um

2074
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,880
uh is just equal and it throws out

2075
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,839
approximations

2076
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,440
coefficients it's just like you gotta

2077
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,720
work through it and there's probably a

2078
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,400
lot of ways to do it but

2079
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,839
um this free energy value like

2080
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,880
on policy is related to

2081
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,079
this expectation of

2082
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,280
this fancy j which are we do we have

2083
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,200
that in a later slide

2084
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,880
um of basically yeah it's the it is um

2085
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,200
the self surprise i think we have a

2086
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,319
later slide so

2087
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:21,520
um it's the expectation of how surprised

2088
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,960
you are

2089
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,200
given about your policies given the

2090
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,319
states

2091
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,640
so that's like how surprised are you

2092
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,240
about where you are

2093
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,799
that's why it's about yourself surprise

2094
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,520
about policy given state estimates

2095
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,799
that value plus

2096
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,440
the divergence which is like a kl

2097
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,480
divergence

2098
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,760
between the state estimate

2099
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,799
versus the actual flow and there's

2100
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,720
probably a lot to say about

2101
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
these kinds of information theoretic

2102
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,000
divergences

2103
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,280
um but it turns out that that is going

2104
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,760
to be

2105
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,039
greater than or equal to how surprised

2106
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:01,839
you are on

2107
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,760
policy itself so almost reading it

2108
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,839
backwards it's like how surprised you

2109
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,480
are to find yourself doing a policy

2110
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,920
which is not just an instantaneous

2111
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,799
action a policy is the trajectory

2112
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,079
like i can't believe i'm the kind of

2113
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,079
person who's on the top of mount everest

2114
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,039
that is if you've been like you know a

2115
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,039
700 pound person down to your couch at

2116
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,240
one point in your life like i can't

2117
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,680
believe i'm on top of mount everest

2118
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,119
would be kind of like i've taken a

2119
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,880
policy that i've ran every day and hiked

2120
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,920
all this stuff and now

2121
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,280
i'm not at first yeah so yeah so we

2122
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,559
what we really want to know is given a

2123
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,920
um optimistic self identity

2124
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,839
a persisting self identity now some

2125
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:40,960
people get hung up on that they're like

2126
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,720
what if my self identity is negative

2127
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,160
well it'd be equivalent to um the heart

2128
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:46,799
or lungs

2129
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,640
stopping existing it'd be then you

2130
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,839
wouldn't see that

2131
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,720
system treading water and that's why

2132
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,280
it's

2133
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,400
tragic when it does happen so we want to

2134
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,039
think about

2135
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,799
how surprised are individuals with

2136
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,880
respect to policy this doesn't tell you

2137
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,319
how to know what to expect or what

2138
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,240
policies are possible but this is

2139
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,160
how surprised one is about their own

2140
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,440
policy

2141
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,680
is going to be approximated with an

2142
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,680
expectation so it's tractable

2143
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,160
of surprisal of policy given states

2144
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,319
which is much easier to calculate

2145
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,079
much easier to say how surprised am i

2146
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,240
about um how much i've been investing

2147
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,520
given how much i have

2148
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,359
rather than computing the total space of

2149
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,799
everything that could happen which is

2150
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,240
infinite plus just the details

2151
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,640
of how far off you are so if you're on

2152
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,520
the ball

2153
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,160
then this divergence term is low and

2154
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,880
then

2155
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,359
your the variational free energy is like

2156
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,400
kind of closer

2157
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,160
to the idealized minimal surprise and

2158
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,920
this is something that one does want

2159
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,440
minimal surprise on because

2160
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,920
in a dissipating world you get the

2161
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,520
disorder for free

2162
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,280
and so this is something that's actually

2163
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,839
being like asymptotically converged

2164
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,160
towards

2165
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,119
so something i um maybe we should maybe

2166
01:07:59,119 --> 01:07:59,839
clarify

2167
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,760
in the paper i think that the authors

2168
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,760
use like self-information

2169
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,280
or surprisal they don't they don't

2170
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,839
really talk about self-supprisal

2171
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,359
um and this is kind of like we're

2172
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,039
conflating now with like last week's

2173
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,880
paper about um like

2174
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,200
who is doing who is creating the model

2175
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,560
of the self like when

2176
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,359
you have a self model who is exactly

2177
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,279
constructing that self model and i think

2178
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,520
like in terms of this it's like

2179
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,719
surprisal over policy okay but like

2180
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,600
in relation to your model of yourself or

2181
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,359
i think your model of yourself is part

2182
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,120
of like your generative model

2183
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,799
overall yeah maybe yeah interesting

2184
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
cool let's go to um 29

2185
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,479
all right so this was so after thinking

2186
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:43,198
about

2187
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,399
this landscape of flows being

2188
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,040
operationalized as a variational free

2189
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,759
energy

2190
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,679
landscape that we're going to be able to

2191
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,080
do some kinds of operations

2192
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,719
on um now

2193
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,640
there can be sort of dimension play

2194
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,520
with mapping states from this is

2195
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,399
something i would

2196
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,759
like to ask the authors about is like

2197
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,000
which connecting which manifolds to

2198
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,920
which manifolds matter what's the hookup

2199
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,880
we need

2200
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,080
which ones are the fep providing us with

2201
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,799
because in this quote they connect it to

2202
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,880
the information geometry

2203
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,960
and geometry is just the shape of things

2204
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,158
so it's kind of like

2205
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,880
the shape of that information landscape

2206
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,719
you can think about the

2207
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,520
physical landscape or you can say the

2208
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,080
flow

2209
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,080
on that landscape of the water if the

2210
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,359
water fell on it

2211
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,560
and so it's kind of like okay

2212
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,560
information geometry is one thing

2213
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,679
and then this is partitioning with an

2214
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,600
information geometry

2215
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,198
angle according to this

2216
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,520
markov blanket active inference

2217
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,880
partitioning

2218
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,198
so the quote says and then blue you can

2219
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,158
give any thought on it

2220
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,199
conversely on this extrinsic manifold so

2221
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,159
viewed from the outside the internal

2222
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,159
states minimize variational free energy

2223
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,920
when conditioned on the blanket states

2224
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,280
in other words whenever the blanket

2225
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,600
states change that could be sense or

2226
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,560
action

2227
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,560
the expected internal state changes and

2228
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,000
there is movement on the

2229
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,480
extrinsic manifold that by construction

2230
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,000
so is this how things are or how we're

2231
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,360
constructing them

2232
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,239
can be cast as bayesian belief updating

2233
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,360
this is because the

2234
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,520
expected internal state encodes

2235
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,960
probabilistic

2236
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
i.e bayesian beliefs about external

2237
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,280
states they act as if

2238
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,640
there's an internal state that's

2239
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,239
encoding or representing or at least

2240
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,800
acting as if it encoded or represented

2241
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,640
actions about external states the

2242
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,719
blanket states here can be construed

2243
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:39,920
as the sensory impressions of the

2244
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,760
external states on the market blank

2245
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,239
blanket that contain the internal states

2246
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,840
in short it may be more useful to

2247
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,280
consider the system from the point of

2248
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,960
view of the extrinsic information

2249
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,000
geometry

2250
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,080
the probabilities encoded by internal

2251
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,400
states like neural firing patterns

2252
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,199
going out rather than from the point of

2253
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,080
view of the

2254
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,719
intrinsic information geometry in other

2255
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:01,199
words

2256
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,280
the statistical complexity of the neural

2257
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,239
dynamics

2258
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:07,360
considered alone might be misleading we

2259
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,480
might want to actually

2260
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,520
highlight the neural dynamics

2261
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,960
projected onto a manifold of action or

2262
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,520
with respect to external states

2263
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,440
because we don't just want that raw time

2264
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,880
series like

2265
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,159
doing bitcoin analysis we want to know

2266
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,520
how that is associated with other

2267
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,480
patterns

2268
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,760
in a way that would suggest that it's

2269
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,159
acting purely responsibly or proactively

2270
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:32,480
or

2271
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,320
in some way that we're going to talk

2272
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,440
about how you can describe the

2273
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:41,280
complexity of it

2274
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,800
i don't really have anything to add i

2275
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,400
thought but i just was looking back

2276
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,679
through the paper i had thought that it

2277
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,080
was

2278
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,640
um you know mapping from one the

2279
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,040
manifold of the internal

2280
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,199
geometry or like there was a geometry

2281
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,400
created that that

2282
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
was over the whole internal states

2283
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,920
versus the external states and it was

2284
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,960
that mapping that

2285
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,600
that mattered but but uh yeah i'm

2286
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,360
curious to revisit that now

2287
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,719
so um we have a question in the chat

2288
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,640
and someone asks can you say a few words

2289
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,320
about the islands of awareness

2290
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,280
so that's like the with the sensory

2291
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,800
input is disconnected

2292
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,480
can you say a few words about islands of

2293
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,080
awareness and the relationship to the

2294
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,320
equations you're explaining

2295
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,679
so on this markov blanket model on

2296
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,719
27 if the sensory input

2297
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,760
were damped that would be the islands of

2298
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,120
awareness model

2299
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,920
so if nothing else active inference has

2300
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,440
a process theory

2301
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,960
that is consistent with the free energy

2302
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,040
principle is helping us

2303
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,880
functionally operationally however you

2304
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,239
want to think about it get at this

2305
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,600
island of awareness problem

2306
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,440
so instead of just saying imagine that

2307
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,600
there was very low or minimal input or

2308
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,199
no input of sensory state or

2309
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,800
imagine that somebody could get sensory

2310
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,320
state but couldn't act

2311
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,560
or imagine the only sense they could get

2312
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,600
was hearing

2313
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,960
and then the only action they could have

2314
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,719
is this

2315
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,719
this is a way that we can think about

2316
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,239
totally separating

2317
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,040
the sort of north and southbound traffic

2318
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,960
with the active and the sensory states

2319
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,159
being partitioned

2320
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,360
that's the fristen innovation and so

2321
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,280
the island of awareness was from the

2322
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,560
non-fep

2323
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,960
people it's probably a from a different

2324
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,000
area

2325
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,080
and so to um kind of latch onto that key

2326
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,920
topic that's being more broadly

2327
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,520
discussed

2328
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,360
this paper is saying actually like

2329
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,360
here's the immediate value add of fep

2330
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,480
and active inference

2331
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,400
we can actually subsume the debate

2332
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
around islands of awareness

2333
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,360
which is something you all already

2334
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
agreed was an important question

2335
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,280
and then we actually have our own way of

2336
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,880
thinking about island's awareness

2337
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,640
so maybe if that's a question you care

2338
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,000
about maybe

2339
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,679
um this is a good way that you would

2340
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,679
want to study it because

2341
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,440
it led us to these interesting

2342
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,679
conclusions about islands of awareness

2343
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,360
um okay so

2344
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,440
30. um okay so this is

2345
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,400
unpacking a little bit more about that

2346
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,960
big f

2347
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,800
of pi with the expectation of the

2348
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,000
surprise of

2349
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,320
policy given states plus the divergence

2350
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,440
of the actual

2351
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,000
and the um estimated states so we can

2352
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,679
look at the quotation

2353
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,840
here the divergence between the

2354
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,880
estimated and

2355
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,520
actual states describes the statistical

2356
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,280
complexity of the internal model

2357
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,120
how much do i have to change my mind to

2358
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
accommodate current changes in sensory

2359
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,000
signals

2360
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,960
so with respect to state estimates about

2361
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,440
how

2362
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,640
bright it is it's like

2363
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,000
about whether you estimate it to be

2364
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,159
bright and it is or it isn't

2365
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,360
um whereas this other term the negative

2366
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,239
expectation

2367
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,440
of how surprised um their one is on the

2368
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,719
policy given states

2369
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,840
describes the accuracy and then this is

2370
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,360
a parenthetical describing why it's

2371
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,239
negative

2372
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,159
so minimizing this entails minimizing

2373
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,320
the difference between these two

2374
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,600
so it's accuracy and

2375
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,880
model complexity and then it's just

2376
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,880
you depending on how you have the

2377
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,320
negatives and the positives

2378
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,400
you get good points for being accurate

2379
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,360
but it's a monotonic penalty to be more

2380
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,640
complex

2381
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,679
so always better to fit better always

2382
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,360
better to be simpler

2383
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,719
and those two lines always intersect

2384
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,239
because you can always have a simpler

2385
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,159
model that does worse

2386
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,840
and you can always have a more complex

2387
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,920
model that does better if only because

2388
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,040
it explains some

2389
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,880
little random feature of the error

2390
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,280
signal so this is not about how the

2391
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,480
world is

2392
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,120
this is about statistical partitionings

2393
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,199
like a principal component analysis

2394
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,880
the principal components are guaranteed

2395
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,480
to be orthogonal well

2396
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,159
there's certain assumptions that get

2397
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,159
built into here that we don't have to

2398
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,400
over interpret with respect to how

2399
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,520
reality actually

2400
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,280
is note that the accuracy depends on the

2401
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,719
particular states so the states the

2402
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:53,600
particle

2403
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,159
the pi the total states now actually

2404
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,280
confusingly

2405
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,600
i wonder if this is referring to blanket

2406
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,960
and internal states

2407
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,840
instead of policy as usually we use pi

2408
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,120
to mean

2409
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,560
i had that same question oh yeah yeah

2410
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,600
during written on my paper yeah because

2411
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,120
yeah that's our little icon with the

2412
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
policy pie but this one's cool too i

2413
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,719
like the blanket in internal states but

2414
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,440
yeah maybe it could be clarified and

2415
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,239
which one is

2416
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,880
in here because are we thinking about

2417
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,040
the minimization on policy alone or

2418
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,000
um on the entire thing so let's make

2419
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,880
sure we're

2420
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,480
clear on that one during a period of

2421
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,080
partial disconnection from blanket

2422
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:32,640
states

2423
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,800
so such as dreaming that's the islands

2424
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,840
of awareness

2425
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,520
the variational free energy gradient in

2426
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,960
the following equation will mainly be

2427
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,640
driven by the complexity part which does

2428
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,640
not depend on the blanket states

2429
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,040
so we have the bi-directional traffic

2430
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,239
and the flow

2431
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,360
and then we're disconnecting a sense

2432
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,440
so now it's like the system is just

2433
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,400
emitting

2434
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,040
so to speak flow but that is being

2435
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,159
driven

2436
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:01,199
by the um uh divergence term

2437
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,640
rather than this including the internal

2438
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,000
state policy

2439
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,840
we'll figure it out but this part drops

2440
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,080
away so then

2441
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,719
um because it's not conditioned on these

2442
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,640
um blanket states it's only conditioned

2443
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,199
on the internal model and actual model

2444
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,199
so this d term is only conditioned on

2445
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,800
internal actual states and this one also

2446
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,440
includes

2447
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,880
blanket states so

2448
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,239
you can then do some

2449
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,360
good factorization or mathematics and

2450
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,960
then the conclusion of that

2451
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,920
at least um or the form of this equation

2452
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,800
entails

2453
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,480
that neural processes can perform the

2454
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,320
computations required

2455
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,840
to minimize free energy even when the

2456
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,880
coupling with the environment is

2457
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,520
suspended

2458
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,920
it's like you unplug the computer or

2459
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,000
something and then it's like it stops

2460
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,719
but then

2461
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,800
could you seize sensory input for the

2462
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,320
brain in a way that actually

2463
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,239
um let the brain reveal

2464
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,280
a different stream of output that would

2465
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,320
reflect any complex internal dynamics

2466
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,159
now how will we measure it we'll get to

2467
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,080
in a second but the idea would be that

2468
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,679
we could use sleep and dreaming as a

2469
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:08,239
model

2470
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,880
i don't know and think about how the fep

2471
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,159
could be applied to these islands of

2472
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,440
awareness

2473
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,239
and we come to this same result isolated

2474
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,679
systems will minimize free energy by

2475
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:18,880
reducing the complexity of the

2476
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,840
generative model

2477
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,440
blue i knew i knew you thought that was

2478
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,640
interesting what did you like about that

2479
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,040
um so i i um specifically liked uh

2480
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,040
the fact that they said like in when

2481
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,080
you're sleeping

2482
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,880
there's no accuracy right like or like

2483
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,880
in a in some island of awareness

2484
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,560
type of state if you don't have any

2485
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,239
accuracy because you don't have any

2486
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,440
um sensory input and so when in these

2487
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,040
situations that then

2488
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,880
you minimize free energy by reducing the

2489
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,560
complexity of the generative model

2490
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,320
i think that that's cool because um

2491
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,800
sleep like just from a neuroscience

2492
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,199
like perspective background like it's

2493
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,880
really thought to like integrate and

2494
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,600
solidify

2495
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,920
like your experiences shuffle things

2496
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,679
from short-term memory into long-term

2497
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,040
memory if like they're

2498
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,560
you know necessary like if it was like a

2499
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,400
peak emotional experience it'll be like

2500
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,520
cemented forever

2501
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,199
but all these things happen like during

2502
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,360
the sleep phase so it's literally

2503
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,840
like reducing complexity of the neural

2504
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,600
correlative consciousness also which i

2505
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,199
think is interesting

2506
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,080
yep very nicely said like when you're

2507
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:20,960
getting

2508
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,760
sensory data in there's an imperative to

2509
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,120
make it match

2510
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,120
like to predict what the next word is so

2511
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,640
that your world doesn't seem like this

2512
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,520
like blur

2513
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,000
of just things that are uncertain but

2514
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
then when you disconnect the sense

2515
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,159
the only imperative the only reason that

2516
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,920
was getting complexity pushed up was the

2517
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,280
need to fit data

2518
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,120
but when you don't need to fit the data

2519
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,040
there can be this radical scaling back

2520
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,640
in the complexity of the bottle

2521
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,280
so it's kind of like play or learning or

2522
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,320
higher dimensional

2523
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,360
existence or lower dimensional pretty

2524
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,320
interesting okay

2525
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,840
so 31 this is going to be a connection

2526
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,679
now from that variational free energy

2527
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:58,640
landscape

2528
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,719
to computational research in

2529
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,520
optimization and machine learning

2530
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,000
they're going to reveal variational free

2531
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,920
energy minimization in machine learning

2532
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,199
was predicated on

2533
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,840
minimizing algorithmic or computational

2534
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,719
complexity

2535
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,080
which is the basis of universal

2536
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,719
computation

2537
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,320
people can read the citation and have

2538
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,600
their own thoughts on what it means to

2539
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,199
be universal or be a computer but

2540
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,120
there's the citation

2541
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,120
here's pretty interesting part

2542
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,679
consciousness researchers assume

2543
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,120
maybe uncited who does maybe but

2544
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,360
one could assume complexity has to be

2545
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,280
large computational complexity has to be

2546
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,280
large yet the imperatives for universal

2547
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,880
computation in general

2548
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,000
and the free energy principle in

2549
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
particular say exactly the opposite

2550
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,800
so are we looking for at the simple

2551
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,080
rules end or at the complex outcomes end

2552
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,840
this apparent paradox can be resolved

2553
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,600
easily

2554
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,760
by noting that free energy is abound on

2555
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,360
marginal likelihood

2556
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,280
aka model evidence in the same way that

2557
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,800
the lz which we're going to get to in a

2558
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
second complexity is an upper bound on

2559
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,360
algorithmic complexity so they're like

2560
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,199
it's not enough to just look at how

2561
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,880
surprised you are by individual neural

2562
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,480
states because the brain is never going

2563
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,040
to repeat

2564
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,800
an exact state so you're going to be

2565
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,040
infinitely surprised if you'd use like

2566
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,199
parametric statistics you need to

2567
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,600
actually have a type of

2568
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,440
statistical inference based upon the

2569
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,520
dynamics of the trajectories

2570
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,960
and interpreting them on a flow

2571
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,840
landscape of information geometry

2572
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,440
rather than just being infinitely

2573
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,280
surprised by the specific measurements

2574
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,800
you get

2575
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,840
and then they basically

2576
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,239
write that to kind of speak to the

2577
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,920
island's awareness idea

2578
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,760
it's no surprise then to see that a good

2579
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,440
model of a complex world

2580
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,199
will show a high degree of algorithmic

2581
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,040
or statistical complexity even when

2582
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,120
observed in temporary isolation

2583
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,719
so this is saying okay you unplug the

2584
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,159
computer it's going to radically

2585
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,120
simplify

2586
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,400
if it was a bitcoin node it's

2587
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,760
disconnected from the internet it's

2588
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,159
going to simplify its processing

2589
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,440
but there might be another kind of

2590
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,440
system that has a

2591
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,080
high degree take your empirical question

2592
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,280
what high degree or

2593
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,719
shouldn't they be simpler or wouldn't it

2594
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,880
simplify once it's isolated

2595
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,320
but that's the kind of interesting

2596
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,080
behavior we would expect or be

2597
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,120
predicting to see

2598
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,159
from an isolated system and just my

2599
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,600
question for the author was

2600
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,199
what does it mean that the free energy

2601
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,639
is bounding the model evidence

2602
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,920
in the same way that this information

2603
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,840
measure which we're going to get to of

2604
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,360
complexity is an upper bound on

2605
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,920
algorithmic complexity

2606
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,280
which is very curious it's a lot of

2607
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,480
things i've only heard a little bit

2608
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,040
about

2609
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,400
so it's just very interesting to think

2610
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,759
about what did this make you think about

2611
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,760
um well so i think i put what i thought

2612
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,440
about this in a few slides

2613
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,639
away from now we'll we'll loop back into

2614
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,280
that i think

2615
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,280
cool so then we're like okay what is

2616
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,280
this lz complexity because blue and i

2617
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,080
both love complexity and like met while

2618
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,600
we were studying complexity

2619
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,080
a few years ago so we were both excited

2620
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,880
with that

2621
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,440
and this levels if complexity measure

2622
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,000
was

2623
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,360
our statistic however you want to think

2624
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,440
about it was first presented in the

2625
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:01,920
article

2626
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,760
on the complexity of finite sequences in

2627
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,000
1976 by two israeli computer

2628
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,400
scientists uh lempel and ziv this

2629
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,480
complexity measure is related

2630
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,440
to the kolmogorov complexity but the

2631
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,719
only and that's so then another one

2632
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,239
would be the shannon so shannon is like

2633
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,600
the surprise with the coin flip

2634
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,520
kolmogorov is like the algorithmic

2635
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,320
complexity usually described as that way

2636
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,239
but the only function that the lz

2637
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,960
is going to use is the recursive copy ie

2638
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,440
the shallow copy

2639
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,679
the lz complexity can be used to measure

2640
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,600
the repetitiveness of binary sequences

2641
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,400
and text like

2642
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,360
song lyrics or prose fractal dimension

2643
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,960
estimates of real world data have also

2644
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,400
been shown to correlate with lz

2645
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,679
complexity

2646
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,600
so it's interesting because learning

2647
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,120
about it on the wiki page

2648
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,280
this is apparently the whole algorithm

2649
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,880
it's kind of just like

2650
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,239
looking for repeating blocks

2651
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,600
blocks with prefixes and pointers

2652
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,040
it's a compression technique so if it

2653
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,280
was something where if your file was one

2654
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,639
two three four five

2655
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,840
you'd imagine that it would take

2656
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,120
i don't even want to say too much

2657
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,400
because i don't even know what would

2658
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,239
have a high or low lc complexity i'd

2659
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,280
like to ask

2660
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,800
but just like something could be easily

2661
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,320
zipped or not

2662
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,840
some things are going to be a minimal

2663
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,760
amenable to lz complexity measures being

2664
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,000
high

2665
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,920
or low so that was just my main question

2666
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,679
is how do we go from this algorithm to

2667
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,639
like

2668
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,600
conscious systems or to measuring real

2669
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,400
comparing real

2670
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,280
systems just pretty interesting not sure

2671
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,639
what to think about that but also really

2672
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,239
looking forward to the um

2673
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,560
everyone's perspective in like 16.1 and

2674
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,800
two because it was out of

2675
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,320
i didn't expect this to come into play

2676
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,920
it's cool to learn about what do you

2677
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,199
think about it

2678
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,920
so i looked at i looked up like the um

2679
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,320
lz complexity versus like the kolmogorov

2680
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,679
complexity where the komodo or

2681
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,360
complexity is like total randomness

2682
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,080
right like 3.14159 like that's like a

2683
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,080
totally like common goal of complexity

2684
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,040
to the max

2685
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,360
but this lz complexity i think is

2686
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,719
related to like

2687
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,960
repetitiveness and sequences and how

2688
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,639
much they're repeated

2689
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,600
so it's a it's different than the just

2690
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,159
totally

2691
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,280
randomness i i guess that was like my

2692
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,480
glint of what i i read from that so yeah

2693
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,679
if something was just

2694
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,280
10 of the same version you know

2695
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,440
transposon or something concatenated 10

2696
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,400
times

2697
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,400
you could define it by defining the unit

2698
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
and then 10 pointers

2699
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,080
you wouldn't need 100 data points you'd

2700
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,080
need 10 plus 10 pointers so like for

2701
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,280
example that would be something

2702
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,320
compressible

2703
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,000
um related to lz but let's take a step

2704
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,639
back and ask

2705
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,159
okay even beyond the measure of um

2706
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,760
the complexity or the entropy measure i

2707
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,880
mean

2708
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,880
let's learn and find out what all those

2709
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,320
are but

2710
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,520
what is dynamical complexity and this is

2711
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,199
really related to complex adaptive

2712
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,120
systems and a lot of the more

2713
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,360
like non-free energy principle

2714
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,120
complexity research that we've been

2715
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,480
learning about blue

2716
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,120
so what is it rather than how it can be

2717
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,159
measured now we're not going to fall

2718
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,199
into a realist trap we're not going to

2719
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:00,639
say systems are this way but

2720
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,320
we're thinking about the kinds of

2721
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,719
complexity that could be dynamically

2722
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,040
instantiated and measured and this is a

2723
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,239
paper from

2724
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,840
um first in 2019 a not b which was the

2725
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,440
particular physics one

2726
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,239
and in dynamical systems theory so this

2727
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,520
is drawing from even before

2728
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,639
complexity in some ways um like systems

2729
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,440
theory

2730
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,040
three types of complex behavior can be

2731
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,880
distinguished so this is not

2732
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,560
feedback loops and stuff like that those

2733
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,920
are the mechanisms

2734
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,520
by which we're gonna be tracking one

2735
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,280
particle in the space so we've got the

2736
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:31,920
particle

2737
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,320
the one ping-pong ball in the airflow

2738
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,080
that's the particle trajectory model

2739
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,760
and then we have the flow which is the

2740
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
air that the ping pong ball is being

2741
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,760
spun around in

2742
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,800
in that sort of vector flow trajectory

2743
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,520
world

2744
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,560
but sometimes we see chaotic itinerancy

2745
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,400
so that's like um when you have two

2746
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,159
pieces of wood in the stream and if it's

2747
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,840
a low the opponent experiment they go

2748
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,360
together for a long time if there's a

2749
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,120
lot of chaoticness

2750
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,960
then high chaotic divergence they

2751
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,719
diverge rapidly

2752
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,040
heteroclinic cycling so this is like

2753
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,000
cycling

2754
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,960
with um so repeating to come back to

2755
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,920
some places but

2756
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,560
often with a twist and then switching

2757
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,239
under multi-stability so like you can be

2758
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,760
like your brain can be like in a sleep

2759
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,480
mode

2760
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,960
and then it can go into the waking mode

2761
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,000
and so yes there is

2762
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,440
a gray zone but you tend to see um like

2763
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,000
phasic or categorical transitions so

2764
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,520
complex systems

2765
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,440
do that kind of stuff sometimes they're

2766
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,920
wild and chaotic itinerancy and wacky

2767
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,560
and then they can also cycle and also

2768
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,000
they can switch and sometimes we can

2769
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,400
even

2770
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,239
un couple those ideas like something

2771
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,159
could switch and the switching could

2772
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:38,719
reflect

2773
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,960
it turning on or off chaotic itinerancy

2774
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:41,920
or something like that

2775
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,920
so and then i just copied out the

2776
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,520
definitions from the chapter

2777
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,520
in the first book what do you think

2778
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,480
about that or what did that make you

2779
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,000
think about with respect to complexity

2780
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,080
just like the dynamical complexity

2781
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,600
versus like you know what's

2782
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,639
happening in a computer is like

2783
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,120
um just how things change really over

2784
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,800
time right like so

2785
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
in in a dynamical system is a system

2786
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,000
that's changing not

2787
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,199
like how complex is this number that

2788
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:14,639
is pi or you know 1.000 right so it's

2789
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,560
just that that basic difference

2790
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,080
cool um okay let's return to

2791
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,639
the kind of free energy perspective

2792
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,480
again thinking about the dynamical

2793
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,760
complexity but we want to be thinking

2794
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,000
about

2795
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,600
the complexity of these dynamical

2796
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,120
systems um

2797
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,199
so this is because the computation is

2798
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,280
performed by a system that minimizes

2799
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,400
variational free energy and inferences

2800
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,880
which correspond to movements on the

2801
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,120
systems extrinsic statistical manifold

2802
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,719
existing measures of dynamical

2803
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,960
complexity however do not measure

2804
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,960
complexity in terms of probabilities

2805
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,560
encoded by neural activity

2806
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,400
but in terms of statistical properties

2807
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,000
of neural activity

2808
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,360
that is properties of the intrinsic

2809
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,760
statistical manifold hence dynamical

2810
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,639
complexity

2811
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,320
at least measured by existing approaches

2812
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,480
should be associated with nccs

2813
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,159
at least in the point of view the fep so

2814
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,520
this is to their point

2815
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,000
that we want to move from thinking about

2816
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,159
neural states to neural trajectories and

2817
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,520
flows

2818
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,040
is otherwise we don't get access to

2819
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,679
um this kind of a dynamical complexity

2820
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:18,560
measure

2821
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,000
because if we just think in terms of

2822
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,760
stop snapshot states

2823
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,600
we're going to think shannon entropy how

2824
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,920
surprised am i by this neuron being

2825
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,560
lit instead of unlit at this time slice

2826
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,040
whereas

2827
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,760
in the flow model we can think about the

2828
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,719
dynamics

2829
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,120
of trajectories through really high

2830
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,520
dimensional state spaces

2831
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,440
and that's where fep suggests an

2832
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,520
alternative an fep inspired measure of

2833
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,880
dynamical complexity

2834
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,120
would be based on the information length

2835
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,719
of neurally encoded probability

2836
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:47,679
distributions

2837
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,320
ie bayesian beliefs instead of

2838
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,840
considering the statistical properties

2839
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,040
of a neural time series and such so

2840
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,480
that's kind of what i just mentioned

2841
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,159
all right conscious activity and

2842
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,400
complexity blue what would you say about

2843
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,000
this

2844
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,360
so this goes back to the lz complexity

2845
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:03,840
really

2846
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,800
and and also the common goal of

2847
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,480
complexity but but i'll just read this

2848
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,159
quote from the paper so it says to the

2849
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,840
extent that proposed measures of

2850
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,199
dynamical complexity

2851
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,679
have empirical validity as measure of

2852
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,639
consciousness

2853
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,040
which is like what is consciousness what

2854
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,000
are we measuring

2855
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,159
like how do we just know if it's valid i

2856
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,520
don't know all those things like

2857
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,199
are packed into that sentence for me

2858
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,960
they may regard it be regarded as

2859
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,400
empirically adequate

2860
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,760
but it would still be desirable to

2861
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,600
provide a fundamental justification

2862
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,199
because this could further support their

2863
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,440
application to controversial cases like

2864
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,800
islands of awareness

2865
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,480
in addition it could help resolve an

2866
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,000
uncertainty about whether existing

2867
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,080
measures of dynamic complexity also

2868
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:42,480
track

2869
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,960
algorithmic complexity so we we know

2870
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,639
that lz complexity is

2871
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,520
is not um it's not the same as common

2872
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,040
goal of complexity because it just takes

2873
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:51,360
in

2874
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,040
the repeats but it doesn't take in all

2875
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,480
of the different ways that

2876
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,840
um pomodoro complexity does so

2877
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,280
here it says it's well known that lg

2878
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,120
complexity for instance constitutes an

2879
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,000
upper bound on

2880
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,159
algorithmic complexity however this

2881
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,679
entertains the possibility that

2882
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,280
conscious activity

2883
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,159
maximizes lz complexity and related

2884
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,080
measures of dynamical complexity but it

2885
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,320
minimizes algorithmic complexity

2886
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,239
this hypothesis is stated and there's

2887
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,719
the citation ruffini 2017.

2888
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,320
finally developing a measure of

2889
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,800
dynamical complexity within the fep

2890
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
could help providing uh help by

2891
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,719
providing a computational explanation of

2892
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:27,760
consciousness

2893
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,960
so i think that that's a really cool um

2894
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,199
thing that the authors have brought back

2895
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,639
around like can we

2896
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:37,440
can we put dynamic complexity in the fep

2897
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,320
framework

2898
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,520
um and they're thereby you know put a

2899
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,880
computational explanation of

2900
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,320
consciousness forward i think that's

2901
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,280
really awesome

2902
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,239
great points okay let's talk a little

2903
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,320
bit more about a formalism that

2904
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,120
people love and also just an interesting

2905
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:53,520
um

2906
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,320
i think question about realism and

2907
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,920
instrumentalism and also just how we

2908
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,719
think about

2909
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,080
the definitions and which things are

2910
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,760
contingent on which so

2911
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,159
here they're going to write a further

2912
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,280
assumption we shall make is that the

2913
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,000
system possesses a markov blanket so

2914
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,080
the language of whether it possesses or

2915
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,199
is

2916
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,199
or there just is one and then the system

2917
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,960
is a secondary description

2918
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,639
and it describes a little bit more about

2919
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,480
the blanket and so this was kind of

2920
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,080
related to earlier but we didn't need

2921
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,560
this

2922
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,800
level of depth and it talks about where

2923
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,400
it's drawn on

2924
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,440
in terms of developing on perl and the

2925
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,080
directed

2926
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,239
acyclic graphs and generalizations from

2927
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,199
there

2928
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,199
but then here what matters is that the

2929
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,120
existence of a markup blanket has subtle

2930
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,199
profound implications so is that the

2931
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,560
markup blanket exists

2932
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,400
in the world or is it that the

2933
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,679
implications of us

2934
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,679
modeling with a markov blanket have

2935
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,120
profound implications

2936
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,440
so how do we think about whether we're

2937
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,040
describing how the systems

2938
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,239
are versus being clear um when we think

2939
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,520
that it's actually

2940
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,920
not how things are or where they might

2941
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,360
be

2942
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,120
congruent and so is it how do we know

2943
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,159
and this is related to a general

2944
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,760
question people has how do we pull out

2945
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,520
these markov blankets

2946
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,800
um from the empirical data

2947
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,320
and relate it to the analytical concept

2948
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,639
so again another slide just from mel

2949
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,239
andrews's paper

2950
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,239
uh discussion where we talked about the

2951
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,639
development of the markov blanket topic

2952
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,000
from markov's initial framing in

2953
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,840
analytical mathematics and matrix

2954
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,480
mathematics to pearls extension

2955
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,239
into bayesian statistics and graph

2956
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,639
theory computational approaches

2957
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,440
and then where fristen has developed it

2958
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,800
over the decades

2959
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,400
and collaborators and then what is now

2960
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,679
being um done and learned about

2961
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,560
with respect to this the post markov

2962
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,000
blanket whatever it's wanting to be

2963
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,639
called

2964
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:50,000
any markov thoughts

2965
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,199
yep no cool um

2966
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,480
this is related to one of the global

2967
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,480
challenges that were addressed which is

2968
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:56,800
that

2969
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,480
mapping where does consciousness come

2970
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,880
into play it's like whoa okay

2971
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,639
all of this flow and the information

2972
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,880
theory and the geometry but

2973
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,719
how are we going to connect this back to

2974
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,280
the consciousness question and relating

2975
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,960
anything about the system to the actual

2976
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,800
um question of what is conscious or not

2977
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,960
and so this is the one quote that i want

2978
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,239
to highlight on 39

2979
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,679
is being conscious versus just

2980
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,760
simulating it and so

2981
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,639
they um write a system with a

2982
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,320
non-equilibrium steady state

2983
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
and a markov blanket comprises internal

2984
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,239
external and blanket states

2985
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,639
as shown in section 3 such a system can

2986
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,400
also be described as performing certain

2987
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,280
computations

2988
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,000
inferences by virtue of causal relations

2989
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,440
between internal external and blanket

2990
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,320
states

2991
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,920
that is what we were measuring those

2992
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,719
relation dynamical contingencies

2993
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,159
in the equations we talked about but in

2994
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:51,920
by virtue of the causal relations this

2995
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,320
is different for a mere simulation

2996
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,560
to be sure a simulating system can

2997
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,320
perform the same computations

2998
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,600
and it will perform them because of

2999
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,440
causal relations between its parts so

3000
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,199
like it is true that the a matrix and

3001
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:03,520
the b

3002
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,480
matrix get multiplied together in the

3003
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,440
program

3004
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,280
however it will not perform them because

3005
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,280
of causal relations between its internal

3006
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,880
external blanket states

3007
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,440
the simulation may instantiate a virtual

3008
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,239
machine

3009
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,400
which may have internal external blanket

3010
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,159
states such that its internal states

3011
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,080
encode or probability distribution over

3012
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,480
external states given blanket states

3013
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,480
but the internal states of the virtual

3014
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,520
machine will not

3015
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,360
be the internal states of the physical

3016
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,719
machine on which

3017
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,199
the virtual machine is running so this

3018
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,119
is getting into the total

3019
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,920
virtualization simulation everything and

3020
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,360
we're not going to read this dialogue

3021
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,560
but on 40

3022
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,920
it's a section from a

3023
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,960
conversation about this topic in the

3024
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,800
book the minds eye which which is um

3025
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,760
compiled by

3026
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,400
hofstetter and dennit and just it's

3027
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,199
about

3028
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,440
you're simulating a hurricane and oh

3029
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,880
well programmers aren't claiming the

3030
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,159
simulation as a hurricane

3031
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,080
it's just simulating parts of a

3032
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,880
hurricane buildings don't get wet

3033
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,480
and then you have to look at it the

3034
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,880
right way well what do you mean look at

3035
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,080
it the right way you know what is

3036
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:08,880
getting wet

3037
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,760
it's your perception it just it's it's a

3038
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,679
big area so it's fun because

3039
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,520
it's something that you know we're all

3040
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,239
just learning about and

3041
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,639
again no one has a great measuring

3042
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:21,920
device so it's not like we can

3043
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,280
resolve these debates there's not like

3044
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,960
an open and shut answer so

3045
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,320
that's what's so interesting is like

3046
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,000
there might be a hot take or a quote you

3047
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,360
like or something that's inspiring to

3048
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,639
you about whether computers are

3049
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,080
conscious or not

3050
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:36,239
but in the end it's almost like

3051
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,639
it's a bottomless pit so that's why it's

3052
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:39,760
good that the authors are actually

3053
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,360
starting to build bridges across it i

3054
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,159
think

3055
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:45,280
all right and then a last um one

3056
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,360
slide on reservoir computing this was

3057
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,520
suggested by sarah

3058
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,840
she was bringing up reservoir computing

3059
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,360
and researching

3060
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,639
maybe things that we'll hear about in

3061
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,639
the coming months like about how

3062
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,119
it might relate to active inference

3063
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,199
reservoir computing is a framework

3064
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,360
for a computation that is sort of

3065
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,360
generalizing or building upon a neural

3066
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,400
network

3067
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,520
model and it's mapping the inputs not

3068
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,320
just to

3069
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,119
a fixed array of nodes or even multiple

3070
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,639
layers like a deep neural network or

3071
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:15,520
something

3072
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,440
but the way that these nodes internal to

3073
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,520
the system the reservoir

3074
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,320
they can actually be any system

3075
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,199
so that could be various types of things

3076
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,800
it could be a slowly changing or fast

3077
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,480
changing system or system with a lot of

3078
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,760
other structures

3079
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,679
and so just we we don't have answers to

3080
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,360
this but bringing up just

3081
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,199
reservoir computing sarah had some

3082
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:38,560
thoughts on it so we'll look forward to

3083
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,920
hearing about this

3084
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,639
and about the niche as a reservoir and

3085
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:43,600
computation as

3086
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,360
um happening and where does that put

3087
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,719
computationalism

3088
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,400
any thoughts on that before we go to our

3089
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,639
last bit nice

3090
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,360
chill and these were just some things we

3091
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,480
brought up but

3092
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,080
you know people will bring up their own

3093
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,000
in 16.1

3094
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,080
uh and anyone else can bring up uh

3095
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,239
anything they want us to put on the

3096
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,400
screen for the author and others

3097
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,760
but there's so much to think about with

3098
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,520
this paper

3099
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,639
they concluded just by writing that

3100
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,639
um how can research on neural correlates

3101
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,800
of consciousness lead to an explanation

3102
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,239
of consciousness and what role could

3103
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,520
free energy principle

3104
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,840
play in this endeavor we have suggested

3105
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,920
that research on neural correlates

3106
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,520
should be complemented by research on

3107
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,639
computational correlates of

3108
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:27,920
consciousness

3109
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,440
in order to yield a computational

3110
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,440
explanation of consciousness moreover

3111
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,199
according to free energy principle

3112
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,719
neural correlates to consciousness must

3113
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,800
be defined in terms of neural dynamics

3114
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,840
not states and cccs should be defined in

3115
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,600
terms of probabilities encoded by the

3116
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,400
neural states

3117
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,760
so specific claims for those to engage

3118
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,400
with

3119
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,840
a lot of um footholds and

3120
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,280
challenging walls to climb but

3121
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,880
interesting topics

3122
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,199
a lot of things that understanding could

3123
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,080
enable

3124
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,000
and we're talking about consciousness

3125
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,119
and neuroscience so

3126
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:02,480
everything is kind of adjacent to it any

3127
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,920
closing

3128
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,440
thoughts blue on this very nice

3129
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,960
discussion

3130
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,960
no thank you so much for having me it's

3131
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,400
been fun participating

3132
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,639
yep that was great times thanks um so

3133
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:13,679
much for

3134
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,920
joining because it makes it a lot you

3135
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,320
know more interesting to make and to do

3136
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,560
so um we hope to see people in 16.1

3137
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,880
and beyond other than that
