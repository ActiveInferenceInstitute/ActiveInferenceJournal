everyone thank you very much for joining

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
this is the active inference lab

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
and you are listening to the active

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,560
inference live stream welcome to the

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
active inference lab

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,720
everyone we are an experiment in online

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,000

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
learning and practice related to active

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,840
inference you can find us

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,960
on our website twitter email

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,079
youtube discord or key base team this is

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,239
a recorded and an archived live stream

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,559
so

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,160
please provide us with feedback so that

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
we can improve on our work

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,920
welcome here

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
and we will follow good conversational

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,000
live stream etiquette

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,559
today we're really excited to be

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,440
discussing

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,280
the neural correlates of consciousness

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
under the free energy principle

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,000
with one of the two authors juan juan

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
jolisa

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
and um today we're going to be having

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,399
our first discussion

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
16.1 and then next week we'll be having

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
a follow-up discussion on the same paper

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,000
so if you have more thoughts or

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
questions arising in the next week

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
that will be a great time to bring them

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
up

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
today in act stream 16.1

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
our goal is to be learning discussing

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,759
and

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,280
hearing from everyone and that is going

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
to be facilitated by

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
this awesome presentation that we are

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
about to

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
hear from wanja so for 16.1

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
we're gonna have a presentation um

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
and then we're gonna just pick up with

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
the participatory discussion

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,119
so laundry thanks again for joining us

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,000
and please take it away

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
thank you for having me it's a real

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,280
pleasure to

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
have the opportunity to present this

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
paper here and discuss it with you

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,839
i'm just gonna share my slides

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
okay i think you can see the looks great

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,038
um

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,160
first i'd like to

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
make a short um

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,520
advertisement for my journal so together

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,000
with

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
sasha fing and jennifer wind i founded

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
philosophy in the mind sciences

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
an open access journal for

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
work um at the intersection of

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
philosophy neuroscience and psychology

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,680
and we recently published

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
a special issue on the neural correlates

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,840
of consciousness

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,440
which you can find at

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,000
philosophymindscience.org so if you're

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
interested in this topic you might want

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
to

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
check this special issue out

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
now in this short presentation

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,159
i'm going to mention just some some key

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,440
points from the

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
preprint and this is the structure

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
of the paper these are just section

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
titles

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
after some more sections after the

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,360
introduction

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
and aren't we revising the paper so we

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
received some

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,159
very useful reviewer comments

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
and actually one of the rarities

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
pointed out that if you're not already

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
committed to or interested

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
in the free energy principle

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
the results that we present in this

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,879
paper may not be that

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,519
interesting or not may not see that

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,239
seeing that

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
relevant and in fact and in part this is

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
i think a fair comment because in the

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
first

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
section after the introduction we

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
review the standard notion of a neural

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
correlate of consciousness

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,599
which has been provided by david

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
chalmers in a seminal paper

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
in 2000 and we then mentioned some

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
challenges for this concept

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
and this motivates moving from

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
the neural corners of consciousness to

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
the computational correlates

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
and um actually then in the next

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,918
discussion we also

106
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,040
relate this to the free energy principle

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
and then it turns out that there are

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
some problems if you want to apply

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
the free energy principle to this

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
kind of research because the main reason

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
is that the free energy principle

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,199
is not itself a theory of consciousness

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
and um it's it's not a

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
theory of computational correlation of

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
consciousness so

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
um there are first some obstacles that

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,759
have to be overcome

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
if you want to apply the free energy

119
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
principle to research on consciousness

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,520
or

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
on neural and computational correlates

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
of consciousness

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
in particular and if you're not already

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,039
committed to

125
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
the free energy principle or not not

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
really interested in it

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
um you may wonder well why should i even

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,479
bother thinking about this if it only

129
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,759
creates new problems

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
that you don't get into if you're not

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
dealing with the free energy principle

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,479
in the first place so

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
um this is i think a fair question and

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,199
um we we're trying to highlight

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
the um genuine contributions that we're

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
making or that we're trying to make in

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,280
this paper

138
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,400
and the revisions and these

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
mainly relate to the final two sections

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
before the conclusion

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
in which we talk about computational

142
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,199
explanations of consciousness in general

143
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
and what

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
the free energy principle can provide or

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
can contribute to this

146
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
this project and um then we

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
try to try to explain what the

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
specific role of the free energy

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
principle can be here and we suggest

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
that it may provide

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
unification so i will

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,000
um take a few minutes to talk about

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
these things in a bit more detail

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,759
um let's see this is a

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,960
more detailed um overview of the

156
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,479
the paper so in the

157
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,800
section in which we talk about general

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
currents of consciousness we

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,800
mention that according to the standard

160
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,479
definition a neural

161
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
correlate of consciousness is a

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
minimally sufficient neural

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
structure and then there are three

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,360
challenges that we mentioned one is that

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
actually what is interesting about the

166
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
neural activity

167
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
associated with consciousness may not be

168
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,599
that it happens in a particular place in

169
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,400
the brain

170
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,759
but more than it's a that it displaces

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
a certain dynamics and this can even be

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,039
a

173
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,599
global dynamics so um it's it's not

174
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
what's happening at the place but what's

175
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
happening over time and the

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,919
or maybe in the entire brain or in large

177
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,120
parts at least of the brain

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,039
then the question another question is

179
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,319
even if you can map certain

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,840
types of neural activity to conscious

181
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
experiences

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
this mapping can be seemingly arbitrary

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,000
so we

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
need to understand why or would like to

185
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,039
understand

186
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
why that particular particular type of

187
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,479
activity

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
is associated with consciousness

189
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
and then a third challenge is that

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
the notion of a neural correlate of

191
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
consciousness

192
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
as defined by chalmers and as used in

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
much research on ncc's

194
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
only applies to usual conditions

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
and does not apply to unusual conditions

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
so after brain damage for instance

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
and another very unusual condition

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
is provided by

199
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,039
potential cases of islands of awareness

200
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,319
so this is from a

201
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
recent paper by timbane and yosef and

202
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
marcelo masimini in which they

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
ask the question whether there can be

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
systems that are

205
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
causally isolated from the body and on

206
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,000
the environment and still be conscious

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
so um can there be conscious states

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,279
in systems that neither receive sensory

209
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,640
input

210
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,839
nor produce motor output

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
and there are some potential candidates

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
for such

213
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
systems which include ex-cranial brains

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
hemospherotomy and

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
cerebral organoids so

216
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,760
an ex-cranial brain is a brain that has

217
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,160
been

218
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,440
extracted from the cranium but is kept

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,959
alive and which can

220
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,840
still display some non-trivial activity

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,839
[Music]

222
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
and in hemispherotomy

223
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
a large part of the brain is

224
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,240
more or less disconnected from from

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,200
other parts or the rest of the brain so

226
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
neuronal connections

227
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,880
to other parts of the brain are cut

228
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
and in well

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
organoids such as neural structures

230
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,279
grown in the lab and in all cases

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
one may wonder well could such

232
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,200
structures

233
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
such systems give rise to activity

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
patterns

235
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
that are sufficient for consciousness

236
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
and what we suggest is that

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
computational correlates could

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
provide at least some progress towards

239
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
an answer

240
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
because computational correlates can be

241
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
applied to different kinds of system

242
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,240
and um and in fact the authors of this

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,519
paper mention

244
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
complexity measures so um

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
there's some evidence that neural

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
activity associated with consciousness

247
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
displays

248
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,360
a large or high complexity

249
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
high algorithmic complexity and

250
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
in principle one could measure the

251
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
complexity of activity generated in

252
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,000
these

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
these isolated systems and that could

254
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
provide some evidence

255
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
for inferring the presence of

256
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
consciousness

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
in such systems now um

258
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
actually um

259
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,839
complexity is also an issue when it

260
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
comes to applying the free energy

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,920
principle

262
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
um i will talk about that in a minute um

263
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,320
and one of the things we do in the next

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
section

265
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,760
section is that we relate the free

266
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
energy principle to

267
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
work on computational correlation of

268
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
consciousness and computational

269
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
principles that um were or that

270
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
have been associated with consciousness

271
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
and um we in in particular we also

272
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
discussed the challenge of islands of

273
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
awareness and this is not just a

274
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,920
challenge for

275
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,040
neural corals of consciousness but also

276
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
especially a challenge for the free

277
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
energy principle one of the problems

278
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
that

279
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,120
is created by trying to apply the free

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
energy principle

281
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
and the reason is this the free energy

282
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,480
principle

283
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
is mainly applicable to

284
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,959
systems that are in causal interaction

285
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,640
with their environment

286
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,600
so systems that are part of an action

287
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
perception loop

288
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
in which internal states interact with

289
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
external states mediated by blanket

290
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
states which

291
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
contain sensory and active states but if

292
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,040
you have an

293
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
isolated system with which is cut off

294
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,920
from sensory input and motor output

295
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,320
it's not clear that you can apply the

296
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
free energy principle

297
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
to describe what's going on in the

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
system but actually there's

299
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,600
there's some um existing work on

300
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
the free energy principle and dreaming

301
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,279
by alan hobson

302
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
and carl fristen and in

303
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
that work they suggest that well

304
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
um i just

305
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
go a bit forward um you can

306
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,680
as is well known i guess you can um

307
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
you you can formulate or describe the

308
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
free energy functional as a as involving

309
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,279
a

310
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,399
accuracy and a complexity term so you

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,279
can write

312
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,839
variation of free energy as complexity

313
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
minus accuracy or complexity plus

314
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,920
inaccuracy and

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
as it turns out the accuracy term

316
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
contains um a

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
term denoting particular states which

318
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,600
involve blanket states

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,279
and the complexity term does not so

320
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,480
the complexity term can be minimized by

321
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,040
changing

322
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
internal states and so

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
in previous work it was suggested that

324
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
during dreaming

325
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,519
the causal interaction with the

326
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,639
environment is attenuated and so

327
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
the this free energy gradient is mainly

328
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
driven by

329
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
the complexity term so actually so

330
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
basically what the brain's doing during

331
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,680
dreaming is minimizing complexity

332
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,720
and we suggest that the same

333
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,639
holds our foturi for

334
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,360
cases of islands of awareness so such

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
systems

336
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
should at least for some time

337
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
minimize free energy by minimizing

338
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,680
complexity

339
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
and now this brings up complexity again

340
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,399
and the question

341
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,279
how this relates to empirical research

342
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
according to which

343
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
neural activity associated with

344
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
consciousness

345
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
maximizes complexity or at least

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,519
displays

347
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
um high complexity

348
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
and um this um

349
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
well tension can be

350
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,719
resolved by by noting that the

351
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,639
um free energy functional contains

352
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,839
a statistical form of complexity

353
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
and complexity measures and

354
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
consciousness

355
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
signs are measures of dynamical

356
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,880
complexity

357
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
that are often based

358
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
on an approximation to algorithmic

359
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
complexity

360
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
so they're actually two different

361
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
notions of complexity

362
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
and play here and according to the free

363
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
energy principle islands of awareness

364
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,680
should

365
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,120
minimize one type of complexity

366
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
but it leaves open the question whether

367
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,079
they

368
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
maximize a different type of complexity

369
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
okay and we suggest that it would be

370
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,560
useful

371
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,600
to formulate or develop a notion

372
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
of dynamical complexity within the

373
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,320
framework provided by the free energy

374
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,959
principle

375
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,320
so it would be useful to define dynamic

376
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,199
complexity

377
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
or measure of dynamical complexity in

378
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,000
terms of the intrinsic

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
information geometry of a system as

380
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,480
opposed to

381
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
a definition in terms of the extrinsic

382
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,120
information geometry um

383
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
but this is actually not something i

384
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,279
want to dwell on here so

385
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,720
um let's go to the next point um

386
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
computational explanations

387
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,000
of consciousness um we

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
well that's a fundamental problem

389
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
associated with

390
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
trying to develop a computational

391
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
explanation of consciousness

392
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
because computations can be performed by

393
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
vastly different types of system so um

394
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,320
you can perform computations in the game

395
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,079
of life

396
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,279
and you you can compute mathematical

397
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
functions

398
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,480
by playing magic the gathering so

399
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,519
the game of life is during complete

400
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,560
and as i recently learned magic the

401
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,519
gathering is

402
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,320
turing complete as well but i wouldn't

403
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
suppose that

404
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
anything that happens in the game of

405
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,199
life

406
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
gives rise to consciousness or that you

407
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
can instantiate consciousness by

408
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,839
playing magic the gathering in a

409
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
particular way

410
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,199
so um just computing the right

411
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,000
mathematical

412
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,240
functions in a physical system

413
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
is not sufficient for consciousness

414
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
or in other words there's a difference

415
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,720
between simulating consciousness

416
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
in a system and actually instantiating

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,480
consciousness

418
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
and the question is okay how can we make

419
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,599
this

420
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,400
difference of how can we understand the

421
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,960
difference

422
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
between simulating and instantiating

423
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,720
consciousness

424
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
and here um we

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
think that the free energy principle can

426
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,679
make a

427
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,559
perhaps tiny but we think relevant

428
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
contribution

429
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
and the main idea is this as i already

430
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
mentioned

431
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,600
um the this is the causal flow in an

432
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
action perception loop um according to

433
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
the free energy principle

434
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760
so here we have a physical system with

435
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,919
internal states um and it's

436
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
coupled to external states via

437
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
blanket states which comprise sensory

438
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,080
and active states and so the main causal

439
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,520
flow we have here

440
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
is in in this physical system is between

441
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
internal states and external states and

442
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,559
they

443
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
so internal states act on external

444
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
states via

445
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
active states and external states act on

446
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
internal states via

447
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,240
sensory states okay now what happens if

448
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
we simulate

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,480
this such a system in a digital computer

450
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,600
now this is a caricature

451
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,960
or a simple visual model of

452
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
a computer with a von neumann

453
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
architecture and one of the

454
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,520
one of the characteristic features of

455
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,799
such a computing device is that

456
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,360
it has a distinct memory unit which is

457
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,880
separate from the

458
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
cpu of the central processing unit so if

459
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,480
you simulate

460
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
a system with this causal flow in such a

461
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,039
system

462
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,760
you'd have to store the values of these

463
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,720
variables

464
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
of external internal and blanket states

465
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
within the memory unit and in order to

466
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,000
compute

467
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,960
updates of these variables you have to

468
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,919
engage the

469
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,840
cpu so the the main causal flow

470
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,600
would be between the memory unit and the

471
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
cpu of course there are also

472
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
variants of this architecture in which

473
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,320
the cpu

474
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
contains a memory unit but then the main

475
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
causal flow would

476
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
be within the cpu and

477
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
also between the memory unit within the

478
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
cpu

479
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
and the rest of the cpu so

480
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,799
it's a different kind of causal flow in

481
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
this physical system

482
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,679
although the computations

483
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,120
performed by this by these systems

484
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,880
can be the same in the sense that um

485
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,919
in internal states can be interpreted as

486
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
conditional probabilities of external

487
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
states given blanket states

488
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,400
okay um so this is we suggest one one of

489
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,919
the differences between

490
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,600
simulating and instantiating

491
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
um consciousness that there's a

492
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
constraint on the

493
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
causal interaction or causal flow

494
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
between the system

495
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
or the system's internal states and its

496
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,320
environment

497
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,799
and of course this may be different in a

498
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,840
computer with a neuromorphic

499
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
architecture

500
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,799
okay then in the final section

501
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,840
we relate this

502
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
these ideas to our previous work on

503
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,039
minimal

504
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,640
unifying models of consciousness and so

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,240
just explain this very briefly

506
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,520
on in general what can computational

507
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
models bring to

508
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,720
bring to or how can they facilitate an

509
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
understanding of consciousness

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
so computational models may serve as a

511
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,679
bridge between

512
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
phenomenal properties of experience and

513
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,200
properties of

514
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
neural activity they may operationalize

515
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
theories of consciousness they may

516
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,000
explain

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
theological functions that is cognitive

518
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,760
capacities

519
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,039
associated with consciousness and

520
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,360
um so these are things that for instance

521
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
active influence models

522
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,480
could provide and the

523
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
free energy principle together with such

524
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
models can then

525
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,200
serve as a unifying framework and how

526
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,159
can it be

527
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
unifying so here's just one possibility

528
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,559
um i'll start with what jonathan

529
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,919
burge calls the facilitation hypothesis

530
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,600
in a recent paper

531
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
so they're here right phenomenally

532
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,320
conscious perception of the stimulus

533
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
facilitates

534
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
relative to unconscious perception a

535
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,320
cluster of

536
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
cognitive abilities in relation to that

537
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
stimulus so this is just a

538
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
hypothesis which can be empirically

539
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
investigated you can for instance

540
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,000
look at different non-human animals

541
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,039
and see whether

542
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,640
non-human animals that have one of these

543
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
cognitive abilities in that cluster also

544
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,799
have the other cognitive abilities

545
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,480
and whether animals that do not have

546
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
one of these abilities also lack the

547
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
other cognitive abilities

548
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,799
and so this would then corroborate the

549
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,520
hypothesis that

550
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
conscious that is that there's some

551
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
mechanism that facilitates

552
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,320
or enables all of these or an entire

553
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
cluster of cognitive abilities and this

554
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:02,640
could be

555
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
what consciousness does um

556
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
in addition to that one could also find

557
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
theoretic theoretical supportive

558
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
evidence

559
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
if one builds minimal models of

560
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,640
these cognitive abilities and one could

561
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,039
show

562
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,799
that a minimal model of one cognitive

563
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,080
ability in that cluster is also a

564
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
minimum model of other abilities or

565
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,559
whether

566
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,120
or if one could show that there's a

567
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,080
common

568
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
computational mechanism that

569
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,360
accounts for all of these cognitive

570
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
abilities and

571
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,520
a hypothetical example just to

572
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,120
illustrate would be

573
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,559
active inference models um if

574
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,679
active inference models of

575
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,799
such a cluster of abilities or required

576
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,600
deep temporal processing or maybe deep

577
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
counterfactual processing or something

578
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,240
like that

579
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,919
so if one would have to posit a certain

580
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,279
generative model with a certain

581
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,039
architecture in order to account for

582
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
these

583
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,760
different abilities and that that could

584
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,240
be something like a common computational

585
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
mechanism

586
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,279
which then could

587
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,120
further corroborate the hypothesis that

588
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
there's something that

589
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
that facilitates these that jointly

590
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
facilitates these cognitive abilities

591
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
together

592
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
um okay and this this could then lead to

593
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,039
something like a minimal unifying model

594
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,480
i introduced this

595
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
term in a paper and neuroscience of

596
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,159
consciousness

597
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,320
a minimal unifying model specifies only

598
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
necessary conditions for consciousness

599
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
it involves determinable descriptions

600
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,640
that can be made more specific

601
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,320
and unify existing accounts of

602
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
consciousness

603
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,840
and i would now add that it can also

604
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
unify cognitive abilities associated

605
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,279
with

606
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,559
consciousness not just accounts of

607
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,279
consciousness

608
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,320
not just theories of consciousness okay

609
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,120
but we can

610
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
talk about this in the discussion and

611
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
the a general picture would be that

612
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
there are these different aspects of

613
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,679
the signs of consciousness there are

614
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
theories of consciousness

615
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
potential teleological functions of

616
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
consciousness

617
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
that is cognitive capacities associated

618
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,880
with consciousness

619
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,039
and there are mathematical functions

620
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,840
that are computed by conscious systems

621
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,159
there's the notion of complexity here

622
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,440
and then neural

623
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,960
corners of consciousness and perhaps

624
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,240
minimal unifying models could um be

625
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
useful here as i've suggested

626
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
and the free energy principle can

627
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
provide a

628
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
way of relating these different

629
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,799
notions and different branches of

630
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,760
research

631
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,559
together for instance active inference

632
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,520
models

633
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,720
can be can be

634
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,320
used to develop operationalized theories

635
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,120
of consciousness

636
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,240
or i mean there's been this

637
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
recent active inference model of the of

638
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,000
global

639
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,320
of the global neuronal workspace theory

640
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,679
of consciousness

641
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,799
and um active inference can be used to

642
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
model cognitive capacities

643
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,070
and saron and

644
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,200
[Music]

645
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
relating these different

646
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,799
notions and these different kinds of

647
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
work together would then

648
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,440
could then also lead an insight into why

649
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,240
different

650
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,400
neuronal structures are associated with

651
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
consciousness

652
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,400
and what play compact what role

653
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,240
complexity actually plays

654
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,360
in consciousness and

655
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
many other questions

656
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
and problems okay so this um is the end

657
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
of my short presentation

658
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,159
uh thank you for listening and i'm very

659
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,600
much looking forward to the

660
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
to the discussion

661
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
thank you thank you for that that's

662
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
really awesome

663
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,880
so you could great

664
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,240
well what a awesome way to begin

665
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
this conversation with a presentation

666
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,360
and

667
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,080
um also really appreciated that you're

668
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
revising the paper and kind of giving us

669
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,679
this glimpse of not just a research

670
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,399
field that's

671
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,520
in evolution but the paper itself

672
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,880
is um undergoing changes so for

673
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,679
the rest of this um active stream 16

674
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
we'll kind of play it by the usual rules

675
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
if anybody wants to just

676
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
raise their hand we'll get to everybody

677
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,600
who

678
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
does um also we do have the slides and

679
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,520
blue who's um here and i had done 16.0

680
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
so we had thought through a couple of

681
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
topics so

682
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
um at this point i guess we'll open it

683
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,399
up to

684
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,919
people who want to raise their hand and

685
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,240
can also just say hello

686
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,520
on their first time speaking and then um

687
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
in the absence of hand raising we'll

688
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
just continue through these slides so

689
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,200
thanks again wancha and let's go to

690
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
stephen first

691
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
and then anyone else who raises their

692
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
hand

693
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
yeah just like to say thanks very

694
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,039
interesting to hear the developments on

695
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,760
the paper

696
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,919
um i was just going to ask about the um

697
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,120
well i suppose there's a lot of things

698
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,799
that come up but i'm stephen by the way

699
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,360
just say i'm based in toronto

700
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,240
but i'm working on a practice-based phd

701
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
through the uk

702
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,960
and one thing that came up on your

703
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,399
slides there was interesting

704
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
when you were looking at the potential

705
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
for the

706
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,159
there to be some sort of memory that

707
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
relates to those states

708
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
um and i was curious whether

709
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,159
that memory itself

710
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,480
might have to be connected to sensory

711
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
states

712
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,480
or whether that might be something that

713
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,159
which is standalone and if so

714
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,760
whereabouts you might think that might

715
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,039
be

716
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
in the brain like is it a hippocampus

717
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,399
type question

718
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
grid cell type question or something

719
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,919
like that so thank you

720
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
thank you and that's a very interesting

721
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
question and

722
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,520
i think it could be useful to show my

723
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,760
slides again

724
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,640
let's do that

725
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
okay so you're referring to this picture

726
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,919
right

727
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,840
um and um yeah so

728
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,279
here the idea would be that um what

729
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,520
in a simulating in a system that

730
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
simulates

731
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,000
a system that is in a action perception

732
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
loop

733
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,159
um there would be some

734
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,279
some internal states that encode the

735
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,880
internal states of of this system

736
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,840
that is being simulated so this digital

737
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,200
computer would have some

738
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
physical states that encode the internal

739
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
states of the simulated system

740
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,960
and um so

741
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,320
coming to the first part of your

742
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,919
question that there would have to be

743
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,960
some

744
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
interaction with sensory input but what

745
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
a sensory input so this

746
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,679
in principle one could say well any of

747
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,000
the

748
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,240
other physical states of this digital

749
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
computer

750
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,039
could serve as a sensory input

751
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,960
to these internal states right

752
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
and the question is what

753
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,760
the causal relations between these

754
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,760
physical states that encode

755
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,840
internal and sensory states of the

756
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
simulated systems

757
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,200
what these causal relations be

758
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,600
similar to the causal relations we see

759
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,559
here

760
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,159
and i would suggest no

761
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,600
um and then there's

762
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
another aspect you mentioned in your

763
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,039
question

764
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,039
which is whether there could be some

765
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,159
memory unit in the brain and

766
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,279
um so perhaps you can

767
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,519
elaborate a little on this you were

768
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,039
you're thinking about

769
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,679
simulations that are going on in the

770
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,039
brain

771
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,399
or yeah i was kind of thinking

772
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,440
um or curious if you could have maybe

773
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,960
two parallel kind of

774
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
you've got the real time real

775
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
sensory input being like experienced

776
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,799
and then there's like an update to

777
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,159
this kind of memory but that memory

778
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:00,960
doesn't

779
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,399
you know that memory rather than it

780
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,760
being a representation

781
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,799
that memory it could be different and

782
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
with that memory i'm curious where that

783
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,240
memory itself

784
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,080
then connects back to the actual sensory

785
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,720
organs

786
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,200
you know so it's not like it's in some

787
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
computed form

788
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,880
um but somehow the the sense of smell

789
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,519
the sense of

790
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,720
the multi-sensory integration is still

791
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,240
happening at some level you know

792
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,960
but maybe in a different way which then

793
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,919
helps

794
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,799
in dreaming and stuff like that

795
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,640
yeah so this is really interesting um

796
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,679
i mean you i think it

797
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,760
could be useful to distinguish different

798
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
types of simulation that could

799
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,039
occur in the brain one would

800
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,399
maybe be involved in um

801
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,120
imagining certain kind of factual

802
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
situations

803
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,519
and another would be involved in

804
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,720
dreaming

805
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,440
and you're suggesting that there must be

806
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,840
some

807
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,039
memories somewhere and

808
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,200
which maybe how

809
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,480
which would yeah

810
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,080
there have to be some states that

811
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,039
that are um that give rise to these

812
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,600
conscious experiences but they're not

813
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,880
directly connected to

814
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,080
sensory input is that what you're

815
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,679
suggesting yeah they're not maybe not

816
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,200
directly

817
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
connect they're connected to the sensory

818
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,840
organs

819
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,720
and so so it's not that it's like a

820
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,440
separate

821
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
it's like you in a way i'm saying it it

822
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,679
needs to keep

823
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,039
some connection to the sensory

824
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,519
what we call inputs i suppose but in a

825
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,360
different way so it's not like

826
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,600
it's it's completely offline if that

827
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
makes sense

828
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
but it might be online in a different

829
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,599
way

830
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,280
which would then still allow you to have

831
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,480
a dynamical system in both cases

832
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,839
and applause will root for how they came

833
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,679
about um

834
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,320
so yeah so i'm curious about that so

835
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,599
basically

836
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,719
um you you know whatever these

837
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,839
priors are this they're still somehow

838
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,000
um engaged

839
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,440
in the sensory organs

840
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,040
in in being alive and conscious

841
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,679
thanks steven um wanja go for a response

842
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,679
there and then we'll continue with adam

843
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,119
and marco and then anyone else

844
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,918
so the one thing that um comes to mind

845
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,119
here is

846
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,680
that it may be useful to

847
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,720
talk about nested markov blankets um so

848
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,720
you'd have the the brain

849
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,560
with uh sensory states and active states

850
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,079
and of the brain from in states of the

851
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,880
brain would

852
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,440
can be regarded as internal states but

853
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,839
within the brain there would then be

854
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,560
another markov blanket and internal

855
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
states within

856
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,359
these internal states which

857
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,400
um would then

858
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,760
be directly associated with

859
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,960
simulations or with dreaming or

860
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,720
other kinds of experience and

861
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,160
so the that there would be an indirect

862
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,320
connection to sensory organs

863
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,280
but the

864
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,880
as it were the sensory states that

865
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
immediately

866
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,240
affect these internal states that are

867
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
associated with

868
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,680
from say dreaming would

869
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,960
um would be within the brain

870
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
are not directly connected to sensory

871
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
organs

872
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,640
cool thanks a lot um adam

873
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,279
at denmark

874
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,400
uh can you hear me yep uh

875
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
hi everyone uh hi wanja thanks for that

876
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
that was

877
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,920
this is really fascinating work and it's

878
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,119
uh disturbing me

879
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,800
and that i've recently attempted to

880
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
present a mineral unify model uh

881
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
using the free energy principle as a

882
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
overarching framework

883
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,960
and i'm wondering whether i need to

884
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
backpedal on some of the visit the

885
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,640
claims i made

886
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,320
so uh i tried to bring together um

887
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
integrated information theory and global

888
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
neural workspace theory

889
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,560
and but in doing this one of the things

890
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,119
i pushed back against an iit

891
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
is uh sorry i'm not tried my little

892
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,240
breathless

893
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,280
um one claim i was trying to push back

894
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,079
on is that

895
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
uh you you needed a neuromorphic

896
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,440
architecture

897
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
um to have consciousness and that you

898
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
couldn't do it

899
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,200
um unavoidable i think this issue is

900
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,400
probably

901
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,000
largely moot um moot

902
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
do the just what probably would take to

903
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
get

904
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,240
enough compute we probably need

905
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,079
neuromorphics just for energy efficiency

906
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,280
but um i'm wondering

907
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,720
um with respect to that that slide

908
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,720
and in terms of causation whether

909
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,240
like by the time we commit to a core

910
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,520
screening

911
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
that involves those entities that

912
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
actually um we might need to coarse

913
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
grain over

914
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,599
the workings of the vinom architecture

915
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,400
and actually go into the virtual machine

916
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,599
and that the the causation is

917
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,599
in terms of like a like in perlian

918
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,359
causation we have to like

919
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,320
commit like commit to an ontology and

920
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,839
then once we have our directed graphical

921
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,200
model then we're doing the operations

922
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,520
and

923
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,800
that's like our causation and so to i'm

924
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
wondering if there might be like a

925
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,640
mixing

926
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,680
in that figure and that if we're like i

927
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,599
don't know if that makes sense

928
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,560
um but and i guess with relation to um

929
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,720
nested markov blankets

930
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,079
i i and and steven's question um also

931
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,680
i'm wondering if this might end up

932
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
taking um

933
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,520
biological consciousness and potentially

934
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
putting it in the same kind of

935
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,119
epiphenomenal boat

936
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,839
in terms of degrees of how much

937
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,960
directness

938
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,079
allows us to um

939
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,200
actually treat uh sensory motor coupling

940
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
as actually being

941
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,280
uh real and causal so i'm wondering if

942
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,000
we

943
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,599
do that we end up like being in the same

944
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,040
boat of

945
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,240
uh not ascribing consciousness to

946
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
um biological systems either even though

947
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,280
they're

948
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
using massively parallel operations and

949
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,800
they are

950
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,720
in their very dynamics having this dual

951
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,598
aspect character

952
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,720
i do not know cool launcher

953
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,760
go for it and then uh marca thank you so

954
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,320
much

955
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
um by the way um adam thanks for

956
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,599
attending this session

957
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,960
so um and you had some immediately i had

958
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,359
some

959
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,079
comments on twitter when i posted a link

960
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,119
to the preprint

961
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,599
and i didn't have time to respond to

962
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,680
these comments so i'm really grateful to

963
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,720
you for

964
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,920
attending this so we can um actually

965
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,000
just discuss the points that you

966
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
raise and yeah so

967
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
how real our virtual machines and

968
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
i think there's two issues that have to

969
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
be separated

970
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,880
and so this is one thing i'm sure about

971
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
and then there's one thing that i'm less

972
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,079
confident about so the thing i'm

973
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,359
sure about is if you

974
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,760
have a course grain description of a

975
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
system

976
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
and abstracting away from certain

977
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
details

978
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,880
that doesn't mean that you end up

979
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
describing things that are not

980
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,520
as real as the things that are happening

981
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
at a

982
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,520
more detailed level um so if you're

983
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,440
describing a brain in terms

984
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,319
of the what's going on in individual

985
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,359
neurons and describe that in

986
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,720
a lot of detail that's more specific

987
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,960
description you have than if you're just

988
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,319
um considering the average

989
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,839
activity of neuronal populations

990
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,079
but that doesn't mean that what's going

991
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,200
on at a

992
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,599
population level is less real or that

993
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,200
these average this is

994
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,960
this average activity cannot

995
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,640
um have causal powers or that

996
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,680
relations that you would describe that

997
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,480
way that you

998
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
could describe as causal relations at

999
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,720
this more coarse-grained level

1000
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,880
that these relations are not really

1001
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
causal relations or something like that

1002
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,960
so i think we agree on this part

1003
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,319
and then the question is well if

1004
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,560
at such a course grade level if i

1005
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,920
understand you correctly at this

1006
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,119
at such a more coarse grained level if

1007
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,200
this instantiates a virtual machine

1008
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
doesn't this mean that the virtual

1009
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,480
machine is

1010
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,920
um as real as the physical

1011
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,200
machine that instantiates the machine

1012
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,439
and

1013
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,960
i actually i don't know but there are

1014
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,400
some things

1015
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,440
that follow if you accept that virtual

1016
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,680
machines can be conscious that are

1017
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,319
really really counterintuitive and

1018
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,760
disturbing

1019
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,680
so um i mean if you

1020
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,240
if you if you what if you've watched a

1021
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
series black mirror

1022
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
there are these episodes in which

1023
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,440
a um person is uploaded to a computer

1024
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,240
and then there's a virtual version of

1025
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,119
that person in a virtual environment

1026
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,960
and that virtual person is being

1027
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,560
tortured for

1028
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,599
i don't know for weeks or even months

1029
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,280
and the assumption is that this

1030
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,560
virtual entity is conscious

1031
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,160
and this happens in

1032
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,920
over a course of i don't know minutes in

1033
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,200
the external real world

1034
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,200
so um if if a virtual machine can be

1035
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,160
conscious then

1036
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,200
conscious experience is that we have

1037
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,720
hearing during

1038
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,800
over the course of several weeks or

1039
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,760
months could

1040
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,119
take place within minutes or maybe even

1041
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,800
within seconds and that's really strange

1042
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,800
but you could also run these

1043
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,000
a computational processes backwards

1044
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,240
and then you'd have backwards

1045
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,040
conscious experiences or you could stop

1046
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,440
them

1047
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,880
at any moment and then

1048
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,880
continue them and or you could have

1049
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,720
physically highly distributed systems

1050
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,160
that um are connected by

1051
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,599
some some device

1052
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,880
which then enable this enables

1053
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,760
this collection of physically scattered

1054
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,400
systems

1055
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,520
to compute some to perform some

1056
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,960
computations

1057
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,599
and if this can then give rise to

1058
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,640
consciousness

1059
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,280
you'd have a very strange conscious

1060
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,880
entity

1061
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,480
and other things like that and then

1062
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,560
there are these thought experiments such

1063
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:16,880
as

1064
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
uh net blocks blockhead

1065
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,839
experiment in which the chinese nation

1066
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,040
instantiates consciousness um or at

1067
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,560
least the

1068
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,960
functional states that um

1069
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
may be associated with consciousness and

1070
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,839
yeah so there are these really

1071
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,160
counter-intuitive

1072
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,680
consequences and

1073
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
this is the main motivation for me for

1074
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,079
trying to

1075
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,079
make a distinction between simulating

1076
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,280
consciousness and

1077
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,400
instantiating consciousness and

1078
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,800
maybe there are some virtual machines

1079
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,760
that

1080
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,280
are conscious but

1081
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
i my intuition is that it would have to

1082
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,960
fulfill very specific conditions

1083
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,319
and one of these conditions may be that

1084
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,920
the interaction it has with its

1085
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,599
physical environment must be the same

1086
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,240
type of interaction that the

1087
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,880
simulated system has with the simulated

1088
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,359
environment and that's what i try to

1089
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,880
illustrate here but of course you could

1090
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,599
you could argue well this is just

1091
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,000
motivated reasoning because you

1092
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,920
don't want to accept these

1093
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
counterintuitive consequences

1094
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,359
and why what would you make

1095
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,920
make this accept why should one accept

1096
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,240
this

1097
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,879
requirement

1098
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680
thanks it's an interesting style the

1099
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,119
argument from consequences with

1100
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,880
consciousness well that can't be correct

1101
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,319
because then this would be conscious and

1102
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,079
we know that's not true it's like wait

1103
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,400
do we know that so marco and then blue

1104
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,079
oh yeah another question another

1105
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,599
comment about a nested mark of blankets

1106
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,640
and

1107
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,640
um so you suggested that

1108
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,920
maybe this requirement is too strong

1109
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,839
if we maybe it's fine if we apply that

1110
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,040
to

1111
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,200
um to digital computers

1112
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,119
but um if we apply that to

1113
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,119
actual to biological organisms

1114
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,240
that we would regard as conscious

1115
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,680
and the result would be that they are

1116
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,920
not really conscious at all so

1117
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,720
it's too strong i guess that's what

1118
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
you're suggesting or what you are

1119
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,079
um the question that you're raising

1120
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,680
so um yeah

1121
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,880
i guess one would have to flash this

1122
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,079
out in a bit more detail but one

1123
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,400
way would be to say look the free energy

1124
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
principle makes some

1125
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,760
idealizing assumptions and the very

1126
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,000
notion of a markov blanket as used

1127
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,480
in free energy principle is as um

1128
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,680
i think many know by now uh slightly

1129
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,800
different from the

1130
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,160
notion used by or proposed by judea

1131
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,599
pearl

1132
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,800
um because pearl's notion of a mark of

1133
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,079
blanket it's just a

1134
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,040
feature a pulse markov blanket is just a

1135
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,839
feature of

1136
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:46,960
a model of certain

1137
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,480
causal graphs and

1138
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,839
the markov blanket used in

1139
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,720
the free energy principle is an

1140
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,920
ontological

1141
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,000
notion or metaphysical notion because

1142
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,280
it's

1143
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,319
meant to be actually part of a physical

1144
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,599
system

1145
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,520
and um one good question

1146
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,559
that it really

1147
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,640
exists and um

1148
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,559
yeah so or that

1149
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,200
optional biological organisms that are

1150
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
conscious

1151
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,720
that they act actually have these

1152
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,440
or that they fulfill these idealizing

1153
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,400
assumptions

1154
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
made by the finishing principle and then

1155
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,839
for this reason

1156
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,000
if we derive a constraint on what it

1157
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,720
means to be a conscious system

1158
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,559
as opposed to simulating a conscious

1159
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,760
system from the free energy principle

1160
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,400
actually requiring that a system

1161
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,760
has these or fulfills these

1162
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,440
idealizing assumptions which

1163
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,240
may be features of a model of a system

1164
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,559
but

1165
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,400
are not actually satisfied are not

1166
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,640
actually instantiated

1167
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,760
by the system itself um

1168
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,200
yeah i think there's an ongoing

1169
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
discussion or there will be an ongoing

1170
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,480
discussion about

1171
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,079
the notion of a markup blanket and

1172
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,280
whether it's justified to treating it as

1173
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,920
a

1174
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,280
ontological notion as a

1175
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,960
feature of an actual physical system

1176
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,119
um and we are committed to this strong

1177
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,559
reading and in the paper so

1178
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,280
we're using the notion of a markov

1179
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,559
blanket in the

1180
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,200
ontological sense not just in the

1181
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,960
epistemic sense

1182
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,640
so this may be a problem

1183
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,960
cool thank you for that edition so marco

1184
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,680
then blue

1185
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,119
thanks um thanks for the uh presentation

1186
00:49:59,119 --> 00:49:59,520
that

1187
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,319
rates that paper i've been significantly

1188
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,040
excited

1189
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,839
by reading it especially a great uh use

1190
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,200
of fep

1191
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,359
uh and buyers because it particularly

1192
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,640
it's a lot of intuitions i had

1193
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,800
um and it's also very nice in the spirit

1194
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,960
of pluralism right this approach of

1195
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,440
really embracing the unifying quality or

1196
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,520
power of the fdp and focusing on

1197
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,119
unification rather than

1198
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,400
another universal or overly saturated um

1199
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,760
claim proposition um and it's going to

1200
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,119
be brought up some scattered thoughts

1201
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,240
but i'm trying to

1202
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,079
also touch on what stephen said i'm not

1203
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,480
sure if i understood what it meant

1204
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,040
um but i'm reminded of the amortization

1205
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,520
so

1206
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
so sam gershman has some nice papers on

1207
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
this uh he has a nice paper called

1208
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,720
uh remembrances of influences past

1209
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,200
so the parameters or the the components

1210
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,480
the factors of the strategy

1211
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
used in influence could also be

1212
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,480
remembered and so maybe that's

1213
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,000
what i thought you meant when you said

1214
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,079
something related to or

1215
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,000
associated with sensory states but not

1216
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,839
actually synthesis itself

1217
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,680
maybe in the physical substrate that

1218
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,920
enacts these sensory inferences

1219
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,400
and there might be partial many parts or

1220
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,160
parameters or factors

1221
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,480
um that can be remembered and that these

1222
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,440
are the ones can be

1223
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,119
these are the ones that also are

1224
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,720
reactivated during dreaming despite the

1225
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,559
absence of sensory inputs

1226
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,960
um but but anyways if it's not what you

1227
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,680
meant then

1228
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,119
let's talk about that later um

1229
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,280
uh about about your conversation with

1230
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
adam i um

1231
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,839
i have a bit of a i'm not sure if you

1232
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,200
meant virtual machines as

1233
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,839
popular as uh in actual computers and

1234
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,880
software

1235
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,480
for me it's very important to to

1236
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,880
distinguish a mere embeddedness

1237
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,359
uh such as the normal virtual machines

1238
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,960
and an embeddedness where the

1239
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,359
where the relation between the embedded

1240
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,280
subsystem and the larger system

1241
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,839
is one that's related by active

1242
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,720
systematic

1243
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,800
mutualistic influence right that these

1244
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,880
are mutually contextualizing and there

1245
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,400
is a kind of targeted relation to it

1246
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,520
which is not the case

1247
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,440
with normal uh virtual machines

1248
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,839
especially in the norman architectures

1249
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,319
because these are more sterile channels

1250
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,839
as i would like to say

1251
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,520
um so as for my own points i've been

1252
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,119
reading it so so

1253
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,480
um i very much uh appreciate that you

1254
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,640
elaborating emphasizing the notion of

1255
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,400
dynamical complexity as opposed to

1256
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,920
complexity and the and very elegantly

1257
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,680
avoiding the many conceptual traps

1258
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,319
that tends to be lurking in these woods

1259
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,119
um

1260
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,920
but but but i have a suggestion or

1261
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,839
question so

1262
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,760
so you

1263
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,000
suggest that the notion of accuracy kind

1264
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,599
of falls away in the determination of

1265
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,640
free energy

1266
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,280
uh variation free energy um for honest

1267
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,839
awareness

1268
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,520
but i actually would argue that that in

1269
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,599
fact it accuracy is still relevant but

1270
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,440
it's a reflexive and of accuracy

1271
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,960
so because of the embedding this or the

1272
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,559
mark of like it's immortal magnets or

1273
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,960
the embeddedness of these ecosystems

1274
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
um you could say that that to some

1275
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,400
subsystems their

1276
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,240
concerns of accuracy are relatively the

1277
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,400
other sources which are

1278
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,119
eternal system and so you see this in

1279
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,559
dreaming right so so the

1280
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,520
so the different subsystems of the brain

1281
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,359
need to update themselves and each

1282
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,359
in relation to each other and so for

1283
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,359
example um i think tononi has some work

1284
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,200
i'm not sure if it's published yet

1285
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,520
but that the activation of uh during

1286
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,480
dreaming

1287
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,319
or the epicenters of the activity

1288
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,520
radiating outwards

1289
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,040
seem to correlate with the sites of

1290
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,800
activation during

1291
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,720
the waking experience where something

1292
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,480
new is learned and so this

1293
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,160
and and under the sap it becomes

1294
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,160
extremely clear well it suggests

1295
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,200
an intuitive nature for why because if

1296
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,400
there's a local kind of

1297
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,480
improvement or local updating occurred

1298
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,680
in that model

1299
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,160
but all the substances in the ecosystem

1300
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,599
are mutually contingent or

1301
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,200
contextualized by each other

1302
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,880
then it would be useful to kind of

1303
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,200
extend the fruits outward or share the

1304
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,800
fruits of that experience with other

1305
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,599
systems

1306
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,800
and so you get you also then lose the

1307
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,760
the necessity of a global coherence of

1308
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,720
the ecosystem

1309
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,839
because there is no uh unified external

1310
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,319
world right all the contexts become

1311
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,119
local

1312
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,920
it's simply a constellation of local

1313
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,720
continents

1314
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,400
which in my opinion is an elegant way to

1315
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,319
look at it because it seems parallel to

1316
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,680
the phenomenology

1317
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,040
of dreaming which um you know argues for

1318
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,720
your paper's motivation

1319
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
because this tentative computational

1320
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,240
explanation

1321
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,680
um has in uh immediately a nice pathway

1322
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,079
to the phenomenological uh aspects to be

1323
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,040
explained

1324
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,280
um so yeah so i would just really like

1325
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,160
to uh

1326
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,839
hear your thoughts about but whether out

1327
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,599
should really be dropped or whether we

1328
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,599
should see

1329
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,319
of still being a part of the variation

1330
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,760
energy in the lower levels

1331
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,599
so more specifically it's as if the

1332
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,200
complexity at one level

1333
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,799
is partially constituted by the accuracy

1334
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,119
improvements of the lower levels right

1335
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,960
and so

1336
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,200
especially because you you you mentioned

1337
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,520
embedded this but i don't see it as

1338
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,520
well integrated in the paper but i think

1339
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,640
it would

1340
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,000
much more bolster your claims especially

1341
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,760
because of its relations with other

1342
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,599
material and consciousness research

1343
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,000
especially before ecamp and their whole

1344
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,040
emphasis on

1345
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,680
embeddedness um and and this also

1346
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,359
relates a bit

1347
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,799
well i would say that that in another

1348
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,640
way you can see this as a contextual

1349
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,200
reduction

1350
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,520
can be seen as uh configurational

1351
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,319
accuracy

1352
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,200
so if we assume that that's the act of

1353
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,799
choosing the configuration

1354
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,200
is itself a question of policy selection

1355
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,079
or the action

1356
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,839
of configuring yourself in relation to

1357
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,480
the context then complexity can be seen

1358
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,839
as a configurative accuracy right

1359
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,160
um and so now you get these weird things

1360
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,359
so decomposition

1361
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,520
of uh complexity reduction in terms of

1362
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,200
intrinsic context reduction

1363
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,720
so kind of the bayesian model reduction

1364
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,480
you see scene the active pure active

1365
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,319
influence of curiosity paper and an

1366
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,920
extrinsic model reduction

1367
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,720
a modern reduction in relation to the um

1368
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,839
contextual

1369
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,839
systems in which it stands relationship

1370
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,040
anyways i'll stop here i think

1371
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,760
i'm rambling on too much so um yeah we'd

1372
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,400
love to hear your thoughts

1373
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,960
so um thank you so much for your

1374
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,640
comments and and questions

1375
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,559
on yeah so this point about

1376
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,280
embedded systems and nested markov

1377
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,160
blankets that's

1378
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,000
definitely something that i have to

1379
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,760
think about a bit more which will be

1380
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,920
relevant relevant so when you talked

1381
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,359
about complexity

1382
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,720
and how within a an

1383
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,319
embedded system within the brain it

1384
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,240
could still be

1385
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,839
um accuracy

1386
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,559
maximization despite

1387
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,760
a lack of sensory input

1388
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,119
via other sensory organs

1389
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,760
i actually wasn't reminded of a

1390
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,280
discussion we had

1391
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,960
with a reviewer

1392
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,319
but not a reviewer of this

1393
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,839
paper but of the

1394
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,839
markovian monism paper we published last

1395
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,559
year so

1396
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,160
one of the reviewers wrought

1397
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,799
brought this actually this this question

1398
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:19,920
up what happens

1399
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,359
in a an isolated system

1400
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,880
and they mentioned that according to iit

1401
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,920
it i i think it could still

1402
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,760
be conscious something like that it

1403
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,040
really reminded me of

1404
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,160
what you said or the other way around

1405
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
what you said reminded me of this

1406
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,240
discussion we had and the my

1407
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,559
intuition i had or the the initial

1408
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:45,920
reaction

1409
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,960
i had was that okay well in such systems

1410
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,319
we have

1411
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,079
maybe no sensory input from

1412
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,680
the from the external environment

1413
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,200
but there's some environment within

1414
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,480
the system within the organism that can

1415
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,680
provide some simulated sensory signals

1416
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,079
and i think this is what you were

1417
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,920
referring to

1418
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,000
and i don't really remember what

1419
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,559
happened

1420
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,880
i think carl had a slightly different

1421
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,000
opinion

1422
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,240
regarding this and suggested

1423
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,720
that the most

1424
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,000
the more elegant way of treating

1425
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,440
this case would be to regard

1426
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,559
um the system as a system that

1427
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,760
just minimizes complexity and it ignores

1428
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,599
accuracy but

1429
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,440
now that it comes up again i don't think

1430
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
that's the end of the story

1431
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,240
and it may be

1432
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,319
relevant and interesting to make this a

1433
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,720
bit more

1434
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,920
complicated by actually considering

1435
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,200
nested systems and simulated sensory

1436
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,480
signals and so on and i don't think that

1437
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,680
this is something we

1438
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,119
can build into the revisions because

1439
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,920
the paper is already getting quite long

1440
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,880
but it's something that we should focus

1441
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,280
on

1442
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,799
in in future work and um

1443
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,839
i would be grateful if you could um

1444
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,920
point me to some of the literature that

1445
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,520
you mentioned

1446
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,960
um send

1447
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,839
and then there's another thing you

1448
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,400
mentioned a distinction between

1449
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
two types of virtual machines or two

1450
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,160
sensors in which

1451
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,400
a virtual machine can be under

1452
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,040
things that can be associated with that

1453
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,920
term

1454
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,839
and um i

1455
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,640
i don't think i am um aware of this

1456
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,599
distinction and

1457
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,000
i'm not sure i already understood it so

1458
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,599
perhaps you can

1459
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,640
repeat what you said um so that one

1460
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,480
is nearly embedded and the other

1461
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,680
has some some additional features

1462
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,520
i think that could be really uh

1463
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,480
interesting and and relevant

1464
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,640
should do an hour later yeah go go for

1465
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,400
it the keep in thread and then

1466
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,280
we'll go to blue and then to dave and

1467
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:25,680
adam

1468
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,160
and another question from chat i try to

1469
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,119
keep it brief so

1470
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,079
so so actually one of the reasons why

1471
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,760
i'm so motivated about this is actually

1472
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,359
because when i did my master thesis with

1473
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:35,920
carl

1474
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,559
i had the same argument complexity so

1475
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,680
he's also like no no it's just

1476
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,960
complexity reduction

1477
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,440
but but the thing is as you know it's

1478
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
about redundant parameters but i don't

1479
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,799
think that's going to be the issue in

1480
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:47,839
the story that i told you

1481
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,200
it's not about redundant parameters it's

1482
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,880
parameters that are mr tuned

1483
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,400
because of their contextual

1484
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,160
contingencies having been updated

1485
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,400
but they themselves not because in the

1486
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
real life awakening experience it wasn't

1487
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,799
they weren't interacting but in a more

1488
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,720
extended context it's kind of

1489
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,240
a weird kind of counterfactual

1490
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,000
marginalization but but it's like

1491
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,280
expanding the scope

1492
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,200
in which the newly accrued experience

1493
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,359
might be rather easy that's how i see it

1494
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,599
and so it doesn't seem to me that it's

1495
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,359
valid to say it's merely about

1496
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,559
removing redundant parameters um it is

1497
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,359
improving the configurat configurative

1498
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,240
preparation

1499
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,559
for anticipation in the future given the

1500
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,799
limited scope of the experience that was

1501
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:29,760
newly acquired

1502
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,440
as for the virtual machines one

1503
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,599
important uh difference is for example

1504
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,400
the

1505
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,559
the the mutualistic relation between for

1506
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,440
example

1507
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,359
merely the transistors and the virtual

1508
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,640
machine they're in

1509
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,839
um it it's it's um kind of

1510
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,240
flat or low dimension there's no

1511
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,720
multi-skill multi-level thing there's no

1512
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,319
adaptivity all the way as in the driving

1513
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,799
uh the driving force behind the

1514
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:55,599
generation of

1515
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,039
the virtual machine virtual machine

1516
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,440
itself is is kind of uh

1517
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,039
is is is simply sent out

1518
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,319
it is not in the path itself it's not uh

1519
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:08,559
contingent upon the path integration

1520
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,760
so so there is this non

1521
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,920
is it's not an active integration of

1522
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,520
their relation okay never mind

1523
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,200
i'll try to think about how to phrase it

1524
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,640
but my intuition says there's a very

1525
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,920
important difference between virtual

1526
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,880
machines

1527
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,400
classical form and the kind of

1528
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,960
virtuality that you that is relevant for

1529
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,000
minds but especially consciousness

1530
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,079
thanks marco for these awesome points

1531
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,920
and that's the fun of the synchronous

1532
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,839
moments that we share is to surface all

1533
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,240
these new connections and ideas

1534
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,559
and then we return to the work and the

1535
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:39,520
sharing on

1536
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,079
you know platforms with each other so

1537
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,520
thanks again for that ronda if you

1538
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,799
wanted to add anything

1539
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,119
otherwise we can go to blue and date

1540
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,000
okay awesome so we'll go blue dave and

1541
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,359
then we'll have heard from everybody

1542
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,000
once

1543
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,680
then the chat and then return to adam

1544
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,240
and everybody else

1545
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,280
okay so i want to go back to um

1546
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,480
your discussion with adam also uh and it

1547
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,000
incorporates um virtual machines really

1548
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,680
so you were discussing simulating

1549
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,520
consciousness versus instantiating

1550
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,319
consciousness

1551
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,359
and the necessary conditions for both

1552
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,520
and in describing like the black mirror

1553
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,000
episode which i've seen and is awesome

1554
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,400
um you know you really implied that

1555
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,000
there's this necessary

1556
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,280
like arrow of time going forward

1557
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,920
for maybe instantiating consciousness

1558
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,200
that's not present

1559
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,240
in simulating consciousness and so is

1560
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,720
that

1561
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
like one of the required conditions like

1562
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,000
does the arrow of time

1563
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
play a role like this bi-directional

1564
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,200
like time

1565
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,839
is like not that that can't be conscious

1566
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:44,240
and

1567
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,000
maybe it would also help um and i'm

1568
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,280
sorry if i missed this in your

1569
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,079
presentation

1570
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,839
because i was a few minutes late but um

1571
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,640
i i don't know how exactly you define

1572
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,520
consciousness

1573
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,680
and i mean i did the dot zero with

1574
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,039
daniel and

1575
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,160
it's really kind of difficult to um you

1576
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:00,960
know measure

1577
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,680
or ascribe scientific properties to

1578
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,960
something that's like

1579
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,640
not clearly defined and i know that

1580
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,960
there's many definitions but i just

1581
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,640
was wondering wanja what you personally

1582
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,079
take consciousness to be or how you

1583
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,640
understand it

1584
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,079
okay thank you very much for these

1585
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,480
questions um so i start with the second

1586
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,480
question because that's

1587
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,520
um in a way it's easier to answer that

1588
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,079
question

1589
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,240
not because i can define what

1590
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,119
consciousness is but because i can

1591
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,640
just tell you that i don't know what

1592
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,319
consciousness is

1593
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:38,079
um so i mean there are

1594
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,400
various ways of operationalizing

1595
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,520
consciousness

1596
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,520
and ways that are used in

1597
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,119
research on the neural habits of

1598
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,440
consciousness in particular

1599
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,119
and many of these

1600
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,960
measures of consciousness involve some

1601
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,640
kind of report

1602
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,000
rubber or behavioral report and uh

1603
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,559
for instance the question is than just

1604
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,640
does the can can the subject report

1605
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,680
reliably report the presence of a

1606
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,640
certain visual

1607
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,000
stimulus or not

1608
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,400
and that would just be an example and so

1609
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,440
i don't have a strong opinion about ways

1610
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:23,839
of

1611
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,079
what's the best best way to measure

1612
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,680
consciousness

1613
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,720
um but

1614
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,880
so what we are kind of

1615
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,760
uh building on here is just the existing

1616
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,880
work on new

1617
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,680
colors of consciousness which use

1618
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,319
various ways of operationalizing

1619
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,799
consciousness various ways of measuring

1620
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,039
consciousness whatever it is

1621
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,119
um but of course this is a bit

1622
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,480
unsatisfying

1623
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,680
and we would like to know what is

1624
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,039
consciousness we perhaps

1625
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,520
you can tell us how to measure it in

1626
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,720
different ways but

1627
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,119
what is it that is being measured and

1628
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,520
here i actually think that a

1629
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,960
computational explanation of

1630
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,880
consciousness could

1631
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,079
provide an insight into the very concept

1632
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,079
of the notion of consciousness

1633
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,480
in that it if if there's a

1634
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,480
common computational mechanism

1635
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,799
associated with different

1636
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,599
cognitive capacities that are

1637
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,440
facilitated by

1638
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,200
what we call consciousness and

1639
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,400
this could provide part of

1640
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,839
the puzzle that gives us a definition of

1641
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,119
consciousness

1642
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,319
so just as an example um think of

1643
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:53,039
the global workspace theory according to

1644
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,000
which

1645
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,119
consciousness is basically global

1646
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,559
availability

1647
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,559
well this you could use that as a

1648
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,839
definition of consciousness

1649
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,799
consciousness is

1650
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,920
of global availability to

1651
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,119
different cognitive subsystems

1652
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,400
so information is process consciously if

1653
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,200
it's not just

1654
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,039
available to um some

1655
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,559
individual subsystems but to

1656
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,880
all or most of the cognitive subsystems

1657
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,400
within the system and um yeah this is of

1658
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,559
course a bit

1659
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:34,480
unsatisfying because it seems

1660
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,880
that it doesn't capture everything that

1661
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,079
we associate with

1662
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,039
consciousness so consciousness has many

1663
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,640
interesting features um so if we

1664
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,200
try to describe the phenomenology of

1665
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,799
consciousness

1666
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,960
then we can say that it's typically

1667
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,000
structured

1668
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,520
we experience spatial relations

1669
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,319
between things so you're not just

1670
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:01,280
experiencing

1671
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,880
say a desk and a

1672
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,039
computer screen and whatever

1673
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,280
else you're you're consciously

1674
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,480
perceiving right now

1675
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,160
you're not just hearing something but

1676
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,960
you're experiencing these things in

1677
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,640
relation to each other

1678
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,319
and there are spatial relations that

1679
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,479
you're experiencing

1680
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,679
they're pothole relations and there are

1681
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,238
also temporal relations of course you're

1682
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,198
experiencing not just isolated events

1683
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,799
but successions of events

1684
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,319
and it seems that what is happening

1685
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,040
right now

1686
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,080
is not just a an instant but it's

1687
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,040
somehow extended or a um

1688
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,198
yeah a specious present

1689
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,238
as william james called it

1690
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,520
and and there are further

1691
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,359
general structural features of

1692
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,120
consciousness

1693
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,279
and what a definition of consciousness

1694
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,238
should provide

1695
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,319
is a means of making sense of these

1696
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,520
different properties

1697
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,400
so for instance

1698
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,279
if consciousness is global availability

1699
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,799
of information

1700
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,679
in a cognitive system why does this mean

1701
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:18,839
that

1702
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,479
why does consciousness have

1703
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:26,479
these phenomenological features

1704
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,439
that characterized characterize most or

1705
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:30,960
maybe all

1706
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,520
types of conscious experience so that's

1707
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,960
something that a

1708
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,600
definition of consciousness should

1709
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,238
provide

1710
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,679
in addition to just saying

1711
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,000
what's happening in the brain and

1712
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,479
computational models i think could

1713
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,279
provide

1714
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,719
a means of

1715
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,880
breaching levels of descriptions

1716
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,360
let's say

1717
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,199
descriptions of neural activity and

1718
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,320
neural mechanisms

1719
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,760
and then phenomenological descriptions

1720
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,360
that um describe

1721
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,640
features of consciousness as they appear

1722
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,719
from the first person perspective

1723
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,719
and integrated information theory is of

1724
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:21,440
course an

1725
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,480
example of a theory that tries to

1726
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,960
achieve just that starting with

1727
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,080
phenomenological

1728
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,880
axioms that characterize consciousness

1729
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,840
or

1730
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,400
typical forms of conscious experience

1731
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,640
and then trying to

1732
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,960
operationalize these axioms

1733
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,679
in a formal way such structure they can

1734
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:44,880
be

1735
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,560
applied to your

1736
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,920
neural structures on your activity

1737
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,560
or other kind of system and

1738
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,280
in principle i i think this this would

1739
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,360
be how one should

1740
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,600
try to define consciousness

1741
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,040
um finding computational mechanisms

1742
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,920
underpinning cognitive capacities that

1743
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,719
are associated with consciousness

1744
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,120
and trying to relate

1745
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,040
models of neural activity or maybe

1746
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,960
computational models of cognitive

1747
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,800
capacities

1748
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,760
two characteristic phenomenological

1749
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,320
features of conscious experience

1750
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,480
and then yeah so that this is

1751
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,440
what what i think how one should

1752
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,640
approach the question

1753
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,280
what is consciousness can i ask a

1754
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,440
follow-up really quick

1755
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,360
yes uh so i just wanted to um

1756
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,800
so you're just you're describing really

1757
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,880
this global availability

1758
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,679
and like able it's it sounds a lot like

1759
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:58,239
um

1760
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,640
david krakauer described individuality

1761
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,320
like in 2020

1762
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
with with like this bi-directional

1763
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,520
information flow

1764
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,320
in in an individual right but there was

1765
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,199
no

1766
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,280
like conscious um so you have to have

1767
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,199
that downward causation which is which

1768
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,400
sounds a lot like the global

1769
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,239
availability that you're describing and

1770
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,440
so i just was wondering i don't know if

1771
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,800
you've read the paper or not

1772
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,000
but um it also like i got that i got

1773
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,600
that out of what you were responding but

1774
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,719
i also

1775
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,280
tended to think that um you're maybe

1776
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,199
only talking about human consciousness

1777
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,120
but then when you went into iit maybe

1778
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,600
not

1779
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,560
so so do you actually draw a line like

1780
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:34,960
what

1781
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,719
what kind of the system can be conscious

1782
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,320
does it have to be biological

1783
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,000
does it have to be like higher order

1784
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,440
vertebrates or

1785
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,920
um can do you think that this is

1786
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,320
especially in terms of computationally

1787
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,320
like defining consciousness which i also

1788
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
think is a great place to start

1789
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,520
um but does does this mean that maybe

1790
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,640
all systems up and down the um you know

1791
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,560
evolutionary ladder can maybe

1792
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,239
have some degree of consciousness or

1793
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,440
what do you think what are your thoughts

1794
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,159
on that

1795
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,360
thanks for the question and so

1796
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,760
where to start maybe first um you

1797
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,000
mentioned top-down causation

1798
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,880
i wouldn't assume that consciousness

1799
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,600
involves

1800
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,320
top-down causation so i i don't see a

1801
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,600
reason for assuming

1802
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,719
that and that's not what i meant by

1803
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,400
global availability um

1804
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,000
so um i i'm not familiar with

1805
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,320
this work by david krakow that we

1806
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,360
mentioned

1807
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,000
but um it seems to me that it may not be

1808
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,400
um may not be directly connected

1809
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,239
what i was trying to

1810
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,280
um and then um

1811
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,199
the question where where to draw the

1812
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,120
line between conscious and unconscious

1813
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,679
questions

1814
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,960
uh systems that's i think a really

1815
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,760
interesting

1816
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,199
question and a further i mean i'm

1817
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,679
in the beginning of the talk in the

1818
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,280
beginning of the presentation i

1819
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,080
mentioned

1820
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,199
one motivation for um

1821
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,159
going into research on computational

1822
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:16,080
correlates of consciousness and that was

1823
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,520
trying to have some um

1824
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,679
correlates of consciousness or criteria

1825
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:22,800
for consciousness

1826
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,040
maybe necessary conditions for

1827
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,080
consciousness

1828
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,679
that can be applied not just to

1829
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,800
human beings or to human beings in

1830
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,960
ordinary states on or human beings with

1831
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,360
a

1832
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,080
normal brain as it were but also to

1833
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,159
unusual cases

1834
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,000
and i in the presentation i only

1835
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,840
mentioned

1836
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,159
the possibility of islands of awareness

1837
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,280
isolated systems but of course

1838
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,640
unusual cases also include non-human

1839
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,159
animals that are

1840
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,199
physiologically different from

1841
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,440
human beings invertebrates

1842
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,800
artificial systems as well and

1843
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,440
this is largely i would say an empirical

1844
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,040
question where where to draw this line

1845
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,280
and there's recent work for instance by

1846
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,600
um eva blanca and simona ginsberg

1847
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,520
who um have a

1848
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,199
an evolutionary hypothesis about

1849
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,280
consciousness or hypothesis about the

1850
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,080
evolution of consciousness and they

1851
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,679
suggest that a particular type of

1852
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:42,800
learning

1853
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,840
that is a learning capacity can

1854
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,120
maybe the evolutionary transition marker

1855
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,880
of consciousness or

1856
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,159
creatures that during

1857
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:58,080
a species that um developed this

1858
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,719
capacity were were then also conscious

1859
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,920
and the capacity learning capacity

1860
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,600
they call unlimited associative

1861
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,719
learning which

1862
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,920
involves particular

1863
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,199
types of learning such as cross model

1864
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,840
learning and other types of learning and

1865
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,840
so their suggestion would be to

1866
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,440
look if there are what systems

1867
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,520
are capable of this or have this

1868
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,880
learning capacity

1869
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,000
and what what other

1870
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,360
um what other capacities

1871
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,040
cognitive capacities they have and

1872
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,880
um so this is

1873
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,040
basically an empirical question trying

1874
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,239
to determine

1875
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,000
which creatures are conscious and which

1876
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,760
are not and

1877
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,800
we of course need to have some criteria

1878
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,120
that can be applied to determine whether

1879
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,159
the creature is conscious or not and

1880
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,440
if we don't have a definition of

1881
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
consciousness or a

1882
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,120
theory of consciousness that can be

1883
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,679
applied to non-human animals and it's

1884
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,640
really difficult to tackle this question

1885
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,920
but focusing on technological functions

1886
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,280
of consciousness and

1887
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,600
cognitive capacities of consciousness is

1888
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,560
one

1889
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,520
i think particularly promising strategy

1890
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,159
and i was

1891
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:30,000
also mentioned jonathan birch who um

1892
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,760
has proposed this that there may be

1893
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,600
clusters of cognitive capacities

1894
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,000
associated with consciousness such as

1895
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,159
trace conditioning or cross-model

1896
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,280
learning

1897
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,120
other capacities um

1898
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,920
yeah so i i don't know where where to

1899
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,080
draw the line i think it

1900
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,840
is an empirical question and um

1901
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,080
these more empirical projects

1902
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,360
trying to investigate

1903
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,719
cognitive capacities of certain types of

1904
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,199
non-human animals

1905
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:10,080
can i think be complemented by

1906
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,320
theoretical research

1907
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,320
using computational models because

1908
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
that's one of the advantages of

1909
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,000
computational models that it can be

1910
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,239
applied to different types of systems

1911
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,480
not just these systems that have a

1912
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,520
central

1913
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,159
um nervous system such as ourselves but

1914
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:31,679
um also systems that have a

1915
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,280
different physiology or in principle

1916
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:35,760
also

1917
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,679
artificial systems i wouldn't assume

1918
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:44,480
i would make the assumption that

1919
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,080
artificial systems um cannot be

1920
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,760
conscious but i think it will be

1921
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,800
really relevant to determine

1922
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,280
what constraints what conditions have to

1923
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,640
be fulfilled by

1924
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,679
a art by an artificial system in order

1925
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:02,560
to be conscious

1926
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,679
and which systems which types of system

1927
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,360
will never be conscious

1928
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,800
and if for instance this black mirror

1929
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,560
scenario

1930
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,679
is a a

1931
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,800
physical possibility if we could

1932
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,520
actually build such

1933
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,280
devices that simulate conscious beings

1934
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,400
and thereby create

1935
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,640
real suffering for instance that would

1936
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,400
be horrible

1937
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,480
and it would also mean that we could

1938
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,520
just

1939
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,679
make hundreds of copies of these virtual

1940
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:38,400
systems

1941
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,360
and instantiate the same type of

1942
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,320
um maybe horrible conscious experience

1943
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,360
in multiple times that would be

1944
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:56,000
a really um a disgusting scenario and

1945
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,440
so i think it would be

1946
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,960
it's extremely relevant to

1947
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,360
investigate the difference between

1948
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,639
simulating a system

1949
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,320
and instantiating consciousness to avoid

1950
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:14,320
creating unnecessary suffering or

1951
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,800
disturbing conscious experiences and um

1952
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,440
you had a very interesting question

1953
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,000
about the

1954
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,840
arrow of time going forward and

1955
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,920
yeah this is something that i guess i

1956
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,199
have to think about

1957
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,639
in a bit more detail so what what

1958
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,920
happens to the

1959
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,719
causal flow or the action perception

1960
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,239
loop if you

1961
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,719
reverse the temporal direction of the

1962
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,840
simulated system and um

1963
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,040
so intuitively i would say that it's

1964
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,239
important whether the arrow of time

1965
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,600
goes forwards or backwards that you

1966
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,000
wouldn't

1967
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,400
have conscious experience if you

1968
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,679
rewind the experience of

1969
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,840
a simulated system

1970
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,920
but i'm not sure about that it's a

1971
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,080
really interesting question

1972
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,120
thank you thanks for the response so

1973
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,159
we're going to do

1974
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,960
dave then a question from the chat then

1975
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,280
adam and marca

1976
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,800
it sounds like getting a handle on

1977
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,480
consciousness maybe

1978
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,760
suffering because it's been deflated too

1979
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,199
much

1980
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,199
if you assume that something you're

1981
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,639
examining is a

1982
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:41,280
predicate it gets really easy to turn it

1983
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,000
into not just

1984
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,360
a predicate but a thing and things

1985
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,719
are pretty hard to work with mostly

1986
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,199
they seem too easy um

1987
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,360
the

1988
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,719
first first over deflation

1989
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,159
is assuming that conscious acts

1990
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:09,120
or conscious activities are

1991
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,920
persistent long-term things a predicate

1992
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,120
of an organism

1993
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,600
the organism is present now if you if

1994
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,000
you subscript that and say

1995
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,639
is present of certain things now and

1996
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:21,040
then

1997
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,600
under some conditions well then you can

1998
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,679
ask what conditions enable consciousness

1999
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,239
what's achieved what's the evolutionary

2000
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,639
advantage of being able to be conscious

2001
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,520
when you need to

2002
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,760
and people as disparate as gerald

2003
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,320
edelman

2004
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,719
talking about conscious flashes in the

2005
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:41,600
brain the

2006
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,960
the dynamic core crystallizing now and

2007
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,000
then

2008
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,920
and then there's conscious activity and

2009
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,199
then maybe it's not needed because the

2010
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,320
the problem has been resolved earlier

2011
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,280
alfred north whitehead talking about

2012
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,159
threads

2013
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,679
of higher experience within a brain

2014
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,679
for instance something that happens now

2015
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:04,880
and then

2016
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,360
uh and then the transformational

2017
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,840
psychologist gf

2018
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,320
actually gives an exercise to force

2019
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,480
people to be conscious and he said he

2020
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,880
his background is most people are

2021
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,159
non-conscious

2022
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,080
the great majority of the time however

2023
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,159
if i ask you

2024
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,840
are you conscious the answer is always

2025
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,000
yes because i've made you conscious by

2026
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
asking you that specific

2027
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,800
leading question

2028
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,280
now the notion that consciousness is

2029
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
something that comes into you from the

2030
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,800
outside that's been around for a good

2031
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,520
while

2032
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,679
that's what the physiologists in these

2033
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:45,840
1870s and 80s assumed

2034
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,400
so freud since he was busy thinking

2035
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,159
about so many things didn't want to

2036
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,600
tackle that and he just

2037
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,159
assumed oh yeah consciousness comes in

2038
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,600
something's going on

2039
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,400
the outside of my brain my neocortex

2040
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,679
responds to that

2041
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,760
and that's where the consciousness comes

2042
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,719
from

2043
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:07,440
and if i'm not being stimulated well

2044
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,080
i enter into nirvana i don't

2045
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,360
dislike and i don't like i'm just

2046
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,639
in a great blah state

2047
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,000
and the engine is just idling and

2048
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,840
waiting for something else to make it do

2049
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,239
something

2050
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,520
so oh and the other way conscious

2051
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,360
activity is getting deflated too much

2052
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,520
is as i said being treated as a

2053
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,800
predicate

2054
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,400
well it seems that

2055
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,840
if you expand it to a relation

2056
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,560
it might be a lot easier to start

2057
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,520
dissecting

2058
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,120
i'd say off the top of my head a

2059
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,639
relation among 10 terms

2060
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,560
self a is conscious

2061
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,159
with self b of object

2062
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:08,800
x in that conscious relation between

2063
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,080
a and b of x given

2064
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,520
the presuppositions of a b and

2065
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,800
the emergent relation

2066
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,199
and the three

2067
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,800
sets of dissatisfactions or goals

2068
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,520
uh whether it's uh an unpleasant

2069
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,520
stimulus wanting to get away from

2070
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,600
something or

2071
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,960
getting towards something of a and of b

2072
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,800
and of that emergent relation between

2073
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,320
the two so that's ten

2074
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,840
a ten place predicate right there and

2075
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,480
when i'm thinking hard i don't really

2076
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,560
see any of those ten

2077
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,400
dropping out because when i'm in dial

2078
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,880
out dialogue with myself i'm at least

2079
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
that complex and is so so is my dialogue

2080
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,639
with myself

2081
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,120
how about you

2082
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,199
thanks dave for the question uh laundry

2083
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,280
and then i'll ask something from chat

2084
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,719
thank you um yeah so you made some

2085
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,080
really interesting remarks and

2086
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,639
in fact i i think it's important to

2087
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:22,880
see consciousness not just as as a

2088
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,080
property that an organism

2089
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,440
has um static

2090
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,480
property but as something dynamic that

2091
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,159
can be transiently lost and so on

2092
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,440
and um so your

2093
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,400
suggestion to suggestion to treat

2094
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,880
consciousness as a

2095
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,239
phase relation um is pretty interesting

2096
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:48,560
and

2097
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,159
i think this speaks to the the idea

2098
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:57,280
of investigating nested markov blankets

2099
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,800
and interactions

2100
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,000
within between subsystems within the

2101
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,360
brain or within

2102
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,000
conscious organisms and

2103
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,719
i think you're completely right that a

2104
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:13,360
lot of the

2105
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:17,040
relations that can hold between

2106
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,639
um a conscious being and other conscious

2107
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:21,840
beings or

2108
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,440
conscious beings and parts of the

2109
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,679
environment

2110
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,960
must in some way be mirrored

2111
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,639
in mirrored by relations between

2112
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,480
parts of the system of

2113
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,560
subsystems of the system

2114
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,600
and yeah these are

2115
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,400
really complex issues that we try to

2116
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,080
um try to

2117
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,280
try to ignore in the paper but which i

2118
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,560
think we should

2119
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,040
get into at some point especially the

2120
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,560
idea that they're

2121
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,920
on nested systems nested

2122
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,440
mark of blankets within the brain

2123
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,280
so i think this is really important

2124
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,600
thanks for the response so i'm gonna ask

2125
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,280
a question from cambridge

2126
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,080
breaths in the chat and um just for this

2127
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,960
last you know

2128
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,120
25 or a little bit longer i have the

2129
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,040
slide up for 16.2

2130
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,239
so we don't need to worry about

2131
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,920
answering consciousness in the next 20

2132
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,679
minutes let's actually

2133
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,679
build the energy for continuing our

2134
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,280
discussion as we do

2135
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,520
in between the weeks so cambridge

2136
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,960
breath's question was and this is

2137
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,639
related to this discussion

2138
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,920
does every memory or thought episode um

2139
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,000
have a markov blanket of its own that

2140
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,679
can be mathematically characterized and

2141
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,320
measured

2142
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
in other words can we consider every

2143
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,679
thought episode

2144
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,000
every minimal phenomenal experience as

2145
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,920
an independent island of awareness on

2146
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,960
its own

2147
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,880
so wanja i'd love for you to give a

2148
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,000
thought on that how do we

2149
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,080
operationalize the markov blankets are

2150
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,920
we a singular blanket or is it just this

2151
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,040
constellation

2152
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,280
of little transient bubbles and how does

2153
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,960
it relate to this islands of awareness

2154
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,320
idea that you mentioned in the paper

2155
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,560
thank you um yeah so i'm not sure how to

2156
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,360
um how to formalize a memory or

2157
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,239
thought episode but i'm sure it would

2158
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:21,760
involve some

2159
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,040
mark of blanket but that doesn't mean

2160
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,639
that there's an

2161
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,199
isolated system or island of awareness

2162
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:29,920
within

2163
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,600
a conscious system because there

2164
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,840
would be some interaction with

2165
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,719
the internal environment as it were

2166
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,159
um another question that

2167
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:47,920
comes to my mind now is that if if you

2168
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,840
um imagine something i have a thought

2169
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,000
episode

2170
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,440
there will be some part of

2171
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,360
and if we assume that some part of your

2172
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,880
brain

2173
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,719
realizes this broad episode

2174
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,120
what would there be a conscious system

2175
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,360
within a conscious system

2176
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:12,639
because of it if it has the right

2177
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,320
engages in the right cause of

2178
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,679
interactions with its environment

2179
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,120
and i think this

2180
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,239
should be added as a or could be built

2181
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,360
into

2182
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,679
a further constraint of what what it

2183
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:28,639
means to

2184
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,840
simulate as opposed to instantiate

2185
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,360
consciousness um i'm not sure how

2186
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,880
exactly but

2187
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,080
so no i wouldn't say there's an island

2188
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,280
of awareness

2189
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,199
when you have a thought episode or

2190
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,960
remember some events

2191
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,400
um but there are some really i think

2192
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,199
relevant points associated with this

2193
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,239
yeah

2194
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:57,840
thanks and it's just funny how we talk

2195
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
about instantiation and for instance

2196
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,440
and we talk about instances of virtual

2197
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,360
machines in the linux

2198
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,960
sense so it's actually a nice

2199
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,480
computational um

2200
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,760
language so i have adam and then

2201
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,040
marco than anyone else who wants to um

2202
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:18,000
raise their hand so adam or yep go ahead

2203
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,080
uh hi can you hear me yep as usual

2204
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,320
stop asking then so um

2205
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,480
i you mentioned like with the reviewers

2206
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,520
um uh so like

2207
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,199
you have these like lists of like places

2208
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,280
where like your intuition is balking

2209
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,239
and i i share a lot of those like um

2210
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:41,600
could a nation

2211
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,639
uh be conscious could like um so a bunch

2212
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,120
of tin cans and ropes strung together

2213
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,639
and there's a sense in which like just

2214
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,159
like church tearing thesis i guess like

2215
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,520
there should be a certain universality

2216
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,239
of

2217
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,800
computational realizability and maybe we

2218
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,600
can do like

2219
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,120
um in in principle tin cans and

2220
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,800
string but it just might not be

2221
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,639
practically realizable because

2222
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,880
there aren't enough you know there's

2223
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,560
enough aluminum in the multiverse or

2224
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,159
sorry in the universe

2225
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,920
but i actually liked your proposal um

2226
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,239
that

2227
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,760
like you kind of dismissed it as like

2228
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,280
maybe being like a little bit special

2229
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,239
pleading

2230
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,600
but i didn't find that to be the case at

2231
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,440
all so like if you actually

2232
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,880
created a rich embodiment in embedding

2233
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,960
within a virtual world and then if

2234
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,600
there's some sort of like homomorphism

2235
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,480
between this and

2236
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,440
i guess i actually i don't even know if

2237
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,520
it needs to actually couple

2238
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,120
with the physical world

2239
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,159
like the importance would be that you

2240
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,000
you're having this sort of

2241
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
um functional closure with respect to

2242
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,239
active and perceptual states

2243
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,560
in this sort of self-evidencing and

2244
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,040
self-making that you're having

2245
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,639
within this within the system you're

2246
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,320
doing inference on this

2247
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,440
interaction and

2248
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,800
within the context of which um

2249
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,400
within the context of the virtual

2250
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,400
machine virtual world which

2251
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,000
you're running this um

2252
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,120
it seems like we could say that

2253
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,199
consciousness is arising but

2254
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:17,759
i'm not sure um in terms of

2255
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,239
functions of it so i've been wondering

2256
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:23,679
whether we can think of consciousness as

2257
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:24,880
a kind of like

2258
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,520
world model and we're doing a divergence

2259
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,760
minimization with respect to

2260
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,679
and it's having some causal significance

2261
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,199
of this kind

2262
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,360
and where it needs to have certain um

2263
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,880
additional necessary

2264
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,360
uh properties for it to be a world model

2265
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,520
capable of generating experience

2266
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,320
of having um basically coherence with

2267
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,840
respect to like spaceships

2268
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,679
oral and causation and causal kinds of

2269
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,040
coherence and

2270
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,920
um i'm wondering if that could

2271
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,800
potentially

2272
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,600
speak to the issue like to bring up

2273
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,560
functions of

2274
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,800
which systems um are more or less likely

2275
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,960
to possess consciousnesses like

2276
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,480
we just add in a additional stipulations

2277
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,159
as additional necessary conditions and

2278
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,480
i'm i'm basically wondering if like

2279
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,800
quasi kantian like a priori categories

2280
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,400
or some of the things people talk about

2281
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,320
in terms of core knowledge

2282
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,880
these might just be necessary for any

2283
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,679
kind of

2284
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,679
world to appear to any being whatsoever

2285
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,080
for any kind of coherent sense making

2286
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,159
and with the function being you have you

2287
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,520
have um

2288
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,520
some sort of a data structure

2289
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,440
corresponding to

2290
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,960
the agent and the situation to the world

2291
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,120
and this is acting as a kind of top-down

2292
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,600
controller and in ways maybe is a

2293
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,800
virtual machine of sorts

2294
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,560
if you want to if you have any thoughts

2295
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,400
on that otherwise

2296
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,440
um yeah thank you adam um

2297
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,840
and does the system need a world model

2298
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,119
in order to be

2299
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:59,520
conscious or not and

2300
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,679
um so

2301
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,239
i think if if it needs a world model it

2302
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,840
doesn't have to be a

2303
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,000
very compact model

2304
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,960
um and

2305
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:17,079
[Music]

2306
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,920
i mean it would have it must have a

2307
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,480
world model in the sense that

2308
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,759
its internal states

2309
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,040
must encode probability distributions

2310
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,960
over external states given blanket

2311
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,239
states

2312
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,480
so but but this is not the world model

2313
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,920
you were

2314
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,520
thinking of right um well

2315
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,280
you were i'm wondering if we need a

2316
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,600
little more to actually have like

2317
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,600
composition and i guess like the kind of

2318
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,679
accents

2319
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,159
like to have like things related to

2320
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,119
things

2321
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:56,159
with particular like distinct properties

2322
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,800
um where those properties are situated

2323
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,840
for the various things that are in

2324
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,520
relationships

2325
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,960
and whether this is basically serving

2326
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,199
the function of uh allowing you to surf

2327
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:06,320
uncertainty

2328
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,600
basically like allowing you to both uh

2329
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,400
be informed by and reform these action

2330
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,760
perception cycles

2331
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,960
and maybe you need additional like

2332
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,760
structure built in for this to actually

2333
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,320
be like

2334
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,920
a world represented by the internal

2335
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,760
states

2336
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,800
not sure though i i think perhaps um

2337
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,280
you don't have to have a model that

2338
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,639
contains objects like

2339
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,320
um a system that is conscious

2340
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,080
you can have a conscious system that

2341
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,800
doesn't know what a tree is or what

2342
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,480
an apple is but i think you i mean

2343
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,679
you hinted at um spatial

2344
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,800
temporal and causal relations i think it

2345
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,080
must have a sense of spatial and

2346
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,440
temporal relations

2347
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:06,400
and causation that would be

2348
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,119
candidate i guess so that would be a

2349
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,520
world model

2350
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,000
which um could be fairly abstract in a

2351
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,159
way about

2352
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,560
gives the system a notion of time and

2353
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,520
space and

2354
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,719
causation and this is what

2355
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,000
i guess um i mean one thing that

2356
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,960
i um completely sidestepped here is the

2357
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,040
issue of

2358
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,679
benefit has caught minimal phenomenal

2359
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,520
experiences that it's

2360
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,840
conscious experiences that

2361
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,639
are characterized by the absence of

2362
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,280
spatial relations

2363
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,080
and or even temporal relations in which

2364
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,400
there's no subject object structure

2365
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:56,000
structure so um these are

2366
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,719
also sometimes called non-egoic states

2367
01:37:58,719 --> 01:37:59,920
or

2368
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,760
states of pure awareness or

2369
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,199
consciousness as such

2370
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:07,440
and are this described in

2371
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,159
especially in

2372
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,159
literature from eastern traditions

2373
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,880
because these are states that can be

2374
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,239
experienced during

2375
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,840
meditation but also

2376
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,480
um in other um during other states

2377
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,480
and perhaps you don't need a world model

2378
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,920
and these

2379
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,679
types of experience and minimal

2380
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,960
phenomenal experiences

2381
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,440
thanks oh yeah adam go for it do you

2382
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,119
think it's possible and those sorts of

2383
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,119
non-dual states

2384
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:48,159
that there could be like a very minimal

2385
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:49,600
coherence along those lines like

2386
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,840
sometimes like um who's that

2387
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,840
gun toku like sometimes it's like

2388
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
described as like just spaciousness it's

2389
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,480
like just

2390
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,040
the space of awareness as these stripped

2391
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,320
down non-dual states like could there

2392
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,360
still be sort of

2393
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,800
it's not enough that it's necessarily um

2394
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,560
a movie it's not clearly like

2395
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,400
identifiable it's like here's a movie

2396
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,159
from your point of view and you're

2397
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:11,280
separate from the world and you're an

2398
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,040
agent represented but still

2399
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,000
there's just enough of a point of view

2400
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,960
just enough

2401
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,440
um like they're they're in there but

2402
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,239
they're not like

2403
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,920
reflexively modelable i don't know

2404
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,639
um yeah that's a possibility and it's

2405
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:27,600
actually

2406
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,960
um a really interesting option so

2407
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,199
with respect to a so-called um

2408
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:38,080
non-egoic states of consciousness or

2409
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,840
states

2410
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,440
which the ego dissolves

2411
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,199
there's a possibility that actually

2412
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:50,159
the subject object distinction

2413
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,360
disappears so

2414
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,239
those are non-dual states of awareness

2415
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,400
but not because there's no subject

2416
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,480
but because the subject is expanded

2417
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,600
and contains

2418
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,880
everything there is so i mean

2419
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,280
in such states or in the transition to

2420
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,560
such states

2421
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,600
subjects often describe a

2422
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,239
dissolution of the boundary between

2423
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,880
themselves and the environment

2424
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,800
and one possibility is that what happens

2425
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,440
is not that the the word

2426
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:30,960
or that the boundary becomes blurry and

2427
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,880
then the self disappears

2428
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,000
but actually that i become the world and

2429
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,159
so i cannot distinguish myself from the

2430
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,679
world anymore

2431
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,600
and that's why people say there was no i

2432
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,560
so that's at least one possibility when

2433
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,440
um

2434
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,320
i think sasha i think has argued for

2435
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,119
this

2436
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:55,600
point and one could apply the same

2437
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,520
idea to space i would say

2438
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,400
and that's what would be similar to what

2439
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,080
you suggest that if

2440
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,119
there's there are no points in space

2441
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,280
anymore no place where i am

2442
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,480
but if i'm the world then i'm

2443
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,760
everywhere so there are no

2444
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,480
points in space that i could distinguish

2445
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,600
from the point

2446
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,520
at which i am i myself am located

2447
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,560
because i am everywhere and

2448
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,920
have become one with the world

2449
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,440
and so there's only space as such

2450
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,800
perhaps only the world but no places

2451
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,719
within the world no points that could be

2452
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:43,679
differentiated

2453
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,080
thanks for the response makes me think

2454
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,480
of king of infinite space and

2455
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,000
a circle with circumference of

2456
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,159
everything and inside of nothing or

2457
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,320
however you want to phrase it so um we

2458
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,760
got 10 minutes left

2459
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,840
marco and then anyone for closing

2460
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,360
thoughts and again i have this slide up

2461
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,960
where we're writing things down for

2462
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,040
next week so marco and then anyone else

2463
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,880
who wants to give a closing thought

2464
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,320
and there's one last little question to

2465
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,400
chat to so go ahead marco

2466
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,119
i'll do my best to keep it short um

2467
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:13,280
regarding the last few comments uh

2468
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:17,440
safely say that which is called space

2469
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,400
is called by buddha as no space

2470
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,320
therefore it's called space

2471
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,000
and so your conversation was very much

2472
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
about the notions of emptiness or the

2473
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,119
rate of luminosity

2474
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,400
which is a fascinating body of

2475
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,560
literature in buddhism

2476
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,119
but but i would argue against the notion

2477
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,320
that we should

2478
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,520
take as valid context the idea that

2479
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,239
oh now we contain the whole world

2480
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,520
because it's exactly in that

2481
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,719
phenomenological stage

2482
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,880
where language breaks down and so any

2483
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,960
reports of that feminology must be taken

2484
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,400
with a heavy great results

2485
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,480
right so one alternative is so so the

2486
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,760
way i would see it in

2487
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,280
in semi fep terms is that it's a state

2488
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:55,600
of

2489
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,920
maximum potential reach right so it's

2490
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,040
it's not that everything

2491
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,199
is contained within that state it's that

2492
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,960
everything is reachable from that state

2493
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,679
it's like uh it's it's a kind of optimal

2494
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,320
readiness

2495
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,400
but contrasting that maximum potential

2496
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,000
reach is a minimal determinant

2497
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,159
which relates to the buddhist ignotion

2498
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,000
of no grasping or no clutching right

2499
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,760
you're not grasping to any duality any

2500
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,119
determination

2501
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:18,719
you're just letting go of any

2502
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,800
determination whilst being ready to

2503
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:21,520
determine

2504
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,000
whenever it arises or is necessary which

2505
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,560
is

2506
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,400
related to the co-dependent arising

2507
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,080
which again is beautifully

2508
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,159
uh congruent with active inferential

2509
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,000
tracks um

2510
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,040
so uh i've tried to refrain too much

2511
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,880
from trying to solve conscience but but

2512
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,639
since since something's already been

2513
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,000
raised so i think i've

2514
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,159
uh pinned down why i talked about the

2515
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:43,760
virtual model in that sense

2516
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,800
the virtual machine and so just like um

2517
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,920
adam as always i i also agree very much

2518
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:50,480
with

2519
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,080
with emphasizing the cybernetics

2520
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,920
compared which i found surprising for

2521
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,000
you not to have included

2522
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,280
from what i saw so far in the paper so

2523
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,080
so so um i i think i think one problem

2524
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:02,400
in

2525
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,880
the kind of the folks ecology slash

2526
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,000
language we're used to

2527
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,520
when talking about these things so we

2528
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,280
say that the brain is conscious but we

2529
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,800
only say that because we don't

2530
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,440
have the ability to specify in what way

2531
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,159
the brain

2532
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,239
generates or relates to consciousness

2533
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:17,199
and so

2534
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,679
following david chalmers i would argue

2535
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:20,960
that that it's better to

2536
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,800
use something neutral right instead of

2537
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,239
saying consciousness

2538
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,840
uh we could take seriously the

2539
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,000
phonological invariants across people's

2540
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,639
reports

2541
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,080
and say that this must be some

2542
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,320
integrated a reality let's call that a

2543
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
local space or a locatology

2544
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,360
i prefer to call the c space um

2545
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,880
and so you could say that that the c

2546
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,960
space embedded in the mind's brain

2547
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
which nicely has an acne within the

2548
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,400
marketing

2549
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,960
and is that the c space effectively has

2550
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,000
primarily a cybernetic

2551
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,880
imperative but in the pursuit of that

2552
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,600
cybernetic comparative it actually

2553
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,719
finds itself doing diff influence

2554
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,199
or inferential initiatives simply by the

2555
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:00,400
virtue of the fact that it needs to

2556
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,760
bundle its environment

2557
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,080
which for the c-space for that's a

2558
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,760
sensible conscious space

2559
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,920
um would not be the world as such but

2560
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,880
but the

2561
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,320
world modeling mind's body uh system

2562
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,239
and so you get this weird a tripod type

2563
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,760
distinction which actually joshua bach's

2564
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,280
first one for actually pointing to this

2565
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,400
to this idea

2566
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,920
so that you have embedded in the

2567
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,520
universe in the physical world

2568
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,760
a particular system called the body with

2569
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,639
a brain

2570
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,320
uh with the systematicity that we call

2571
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,400
the mind and embedded in turn

2572
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,239
we have something called the c space i

2573
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:31,440
importantly

2574
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,560
but that itself uh due to its imperative

2575
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,520
cybernetics or

2576
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,000
good regulation uh learns about that

2577
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,320
my body and it's the mutual

2578
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,679
contextualization they're in

2579
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,080
so upon instantiation or realization of

2580
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,880
this kind of

2581
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,800
disease space they become mutually

2582
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,239
dependent on each other

2583
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:54,480
the mind brains activity or let's say

2584
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,040
fitness would translate transitively to

2585
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,560
the students of the seizures which in

2586
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,400
turn transitively

2587
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,239
translates back to the fitness of the

2588
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,080
entire mind body and so this is very

2589
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,440
important to note the the

2590
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,560
the requisites of uh of the problem that

2591
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,080
the initial challenge

2592
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,440
of creating enough challenge enough

2593
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,679
free energy gradients to necessitate

2594
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,119
instantiation such as space

2595
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:18,800
and so i don't agree at all with these

2596
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,960
unnecessary debates about whether

2597
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,040
organelles are goddamn conscious like

2598
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,639
what the hell what's going to come in

2599
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:25,119
for them

2600
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,199
they have no adaptive imperative there's

2601
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,679
no incentive to instantiate some kind of

2602
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,480
regulatory space regulatory subsystem

2603
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,040
right

2604
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,040
there is no coherence instantiated to

2605
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,880
even lead to that there's no

2606
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,119
initial ignition to scaffold that

2607
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:40,320
complexity

2608
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,639
and so i i i yeah anyways that's my

2609
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,000
personal annoyance

2610
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,840
another notion i would like to share is

2611
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,920
the island is the awareness the fact

2612
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,239
that the island is embedded in this huge

2613
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,280
amorphous sea

2614
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,679
is what we should relate to that

2615
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,840
seemingly secluded experience

2616
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,119
um and and crucially and this is very

2617
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,400
intensive but i want to share it because

2618
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,239
of your paper so so i

2619
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,560
i would argue or propose that the c

2620
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,920
space is there where the intrinsic

2621
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,360
manifolds of the extrinsic manifold

2622
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,480
become equivalent

2623
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,960
or at least approximately or or

2624
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,080
asymptotically

2625
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,880
why because uh it's another way of

2626
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,960
phrasing that it's pure reflexivity

2627
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,679
those causal flows or spatial temporal

2628
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:20,320
causal

2629
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,560
activity that is purely reflexive

2630
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,040
therefore would not uh pertain to

2631
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:27,920
directly

2632
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,280
that which is outside there in other

2633
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,520
words that c space is by definition the

2634
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,239
self

2635
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:35,360
referring island and now comes one more

2636
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,960
crazy thing because trauma said we need

2637
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,960
crazy ideas so here's a crazy idea

2638
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,520
um so the point is that it's possible

2639
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,239
perhaps

2640
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:45,440
that this uh tentative islands um

2641
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,719
should be embedded in something and

2642
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,159
therefore we should intentionally say

2643
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:50,880
there's a blanket or a encapsulation

2644
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,800
which can be seen as like a channel like

2645
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,639
a two-dimensional surface which acts as

2646
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:55,280
a channel

2647
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:58,000
but each channel mathematically has a

2648
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,560
bottom

2649
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,480
a limit so what if what happens when

2650
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,520
that island that c space um generates

2651
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,560
more entropy

2652
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,480
than can actually be expressed through

2653
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,400
the interface with wichita's relation to

2654
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,440
the greater world

2655
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,159
right um and so i'm basically trying to

2656
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:14,800
indicate

2657
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,239
um in part adam's suggestions

2658
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:20,239
and intro and elaborate what i meant

2659
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,520
with the difference between virtual

2660
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,480
machines because

2661
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,000
normal virtual machines aren't in this

2662
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
mutually contextualized relation

2663
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,639
not at the level of the physics as such

2664
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:29,199
um and

2665
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:30,800
because it's purely in the virtual

2666
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,719
whereas here the physics

2667
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,880
themselves are co-opted in that mutually

2668
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,080
contextualized relation

2669
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,320
okay sir that's enough for now yeah all

2670
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,000
good thank you marco

2671
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,880
so everyone thanks so much for

2672
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,760
participating

2673
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,840
if anyone wants to raise their hand and

2674
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:46,960
give a final

2675
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,159
just little tweet length

2676
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,960
recap but what i'll say here is

2677
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,679
organizer

2678
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,239
is our next conversation live is going

2679
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:56,719
to be

2680
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,000
on february 23rd and we wrote

2681
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,600
down a bunch of questions for next time

2682
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,760
and there was also things that were

2683
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,199
asked in the chat like about the

2684
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,360
difference between quantum and classical

2685
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,920
computers and simulation so i know that

2686
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,280
we're going to have so many fun

2687
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,679
directions to go to in our next

2688
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,679
synchronous and asynchronous

2689
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:19,360
conversations and communications through

2690
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,199
the interface so

2691
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:23,040
if anyone wants to give a final thought

2692
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,800
um wanja

2693
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,480
thanks so much for coming on it really

2694
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,119
it was um it's a it's a special

2695
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,880
paper it was a lot of fun to work

2696
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,040
through enlivened our

2697
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,000
lab and our collective thought processes

2698
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,320
and

2699
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,800
um yep so if anyone else wants to give

2700
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,320
any final thoughts

2701
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,080
um steven and then anyone else raises

2702
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,360
their hand just for the last short

2703
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,679
thoughts

2704
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:49,119
steven unmute

2705
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,599
just one just wanted to say thank you

2706
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,599
very much and uh i know there's a lot of

2707
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:53,920
stuff

2708
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,480
has come at you so you you've managed to

2709
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,400
field a huge amount of questions but i

2710
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:58,880
uh

2711
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,520
yeah i'd be really curious to maybe see

2712
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,040
your thoughts on how this

2713
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,000
this work can pan out in the world in

2714
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,639
terms of

2715
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:08,400
people's practices and ways of thinking

2716
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,080
about

2717
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,800
other research and how this kind of way

2718
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,239
of understanding consciousness

2719
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,599
could you know play out possibly in

2720
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:20,400
because a lot of work in psychology is

2721
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,599
using

2722
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,560
brain neural correlates to justify what

2723
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,239
they think people are thinking you know

2724
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:26,800
so

2725
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,560
it'd be interesting maybe next week to

2726
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,000
think about how

2727
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,480
how does some of these ideas have

2728
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,239
implications and application

2729
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:37,119
which uh i think they do so thank you

2730
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:38,239
thanks steven

2731
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,920
adam and then anyone else with a raised

2732
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,760
hand

2733
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,880
um yeah this i mean fantastic as usual

2734
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,520
and this is uh

2735
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,199
my it's the most fascinating thing there

2736
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,280
is and i also think though it's

2737
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,199
extremely important we get this right so

2738
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,119
like marco is just discussing i'm

2739
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,400
organizing we're talking about islands

2740
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,520
of awareness

2741
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,679
like how quickly do we move forward with

2742
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:01,119
this research program

2743
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,360
which could potentially you know help

2744
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,880
countless people but we don't want to

2745
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,080
inadvertently

2746
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,000
create like black nourish scenarios so

2747
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,199
if we can place

2748
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,199
a very low prior unconsciousness for

2749
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:12,239
organoids

2750
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:15,040
due to not having the quite the proper

2751
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,080
cybernetic

2752
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,560
grounding contextualization and betting

2753
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,119
that would be great like similarly like

2754
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,960
with artificial intelligence we might

2755
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,440
eventually uh create systems where

2756
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,520
it is in question and so then we're

2757
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,880
dealing with um

2758
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,560
you know are these ethical beings on our

2759
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,719
own are we like doing mind crime against

2760
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,239
these beings or

2761
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:38,400
like both avoiding negative outcomes and

2762
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,040
then maybe

2763
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,880
wanting there to be positive outcomes in

2764
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,159
terms of creating

2765
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,679
beings who are conscious and are of

2766
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,920
value in their own right as subjects who

2767
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,960
experience and there's something that

2768
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,320
it's like to do them so they should be

2769
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,000
part of our moral communities

2770
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,560
all right these are maybe you know it's

2771
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,159
it's not we're not there yet but

2772
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:55,679
we might get there eventually and these

2773
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,440
might be the questions that are the key

2774
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,320
questions for

2775
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:03,199
what really matters for those events

2776
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:06,320
here yep and what's on the table adam as

2777
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,320
you often highlight is everything from

2778
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,320
who we include in our moral community

2779
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,560
false positives and false negatives are

2780
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,599
quite

2781
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:16,800
vitally severe in this issue um

2782
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:20,000
so looks like that's all the raised

2783
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,119
hands

2784
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,000
16.1 thanks everyone for coming this is

2785
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,679
really a great discussion

2786
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,520
and look forward to continuing this

2787
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,840
discussion in 16.2 and beyond thanks
