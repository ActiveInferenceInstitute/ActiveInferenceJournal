00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,319
hello and welcome everyone to the active

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:06,960
inference

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,760
live stream this is active inference

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
live stream 7.1

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
and it is october 27th 2020.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,320
welcome to team com everyone we are an

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,199
experiment in

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
online team communication learning and

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,240
practice

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
related to active inference you can find

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,279
us on

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
twitter at inferenceactive at our gmail

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,199
you can find us on key base or youtube

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,159
as well

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,719
this is a recorded and an archived live

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
stream so please provide us feedback so

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
that we can improve our work

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,640
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
welcome here and as far as video

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,239
etiquette for live streams

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,000
mute raise your hand so that we can get

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
to everyone in the queue

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,520
use respectful speech and try not to use

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,719
the jitsi chat

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,280
if possible today in act imp

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,000
7.1 we're going to start with a warm-up

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
just briefly introducing ourself and

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
checking in

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,280
and then we'll work through some of the

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
sections of 7.1

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
the paper we're going to be discussing

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
is variational ecology and the physics

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
of sentient systems by ramstead at all

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,400
in 2019

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
and today we'll talk about the goals

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
abstract the roadmap

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
potentially move through a few key

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
quotations and then

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,080
preview the figures mainly with a focus

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
on seeing

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
what each figure represents and today in

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
7.1 and next week in 7.2 where we may or

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
may not be in costume

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
we will discuss this paper so please

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,079
save and submit your questions whether

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
you're on the panel now or whether

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,439
you're watching in replay

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
and get in touch if you'd like to

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
participate

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,680
so for the intros and check-ins it'd be

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
great if everyone could just

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
introduce themself and their location

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
say hello in a short intro and then pass

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
it to somebody who

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
hasn't spoken so i'm daniel i'm in

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
california

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
and i'll pass it to a first time

59

beginner

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,680

foundation uh

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
my link to active inference is uh i i

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
did my phd with karl

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
riston four or five years ago still very

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,599

and i'll pass it over to

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
maxwell hey everyone i'm maxwell

ramstead

104
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
i'm a postdoctoral fellow at mcgill

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
university in montreal

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
i'm skyping to you from the montreal

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
suburbs

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,159
um and yeah i work on uh multi-scale

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
extensions of active inference i'm the

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
um first author on

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,918
on this paper that we'll be discussing

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,040
uh very grateful

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
to have such a great group of people as

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
discussants

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,280
and i will pass it to i believe lee is

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
the only one who hasn't spoken yet right

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
no no i've been cool yeah i think that

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,240
gets

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,600
through it perfect sasha has no yeah

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,680
she has okay sorry yep great thanks

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
everyone for the intros

122
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,040
so in these two warm-up questions any

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
thoughts related or unrelated

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
anything that kind of gets you excited

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
and helps on-ramp to the discussion

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
we'll be having

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,600
what is a physical or informational

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
ecosystem

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
that you care about or have studied and

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,080
while people

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
are raising their hand um the first

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,639
ecosystem that came to mind for me was

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
in southeast arizona where there's a

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
grassland ecosystem where there's a lot

135
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
of cool ants and also the grazing

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
agricultural use by cows had a big

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
effect on the ecosystem kind of pushing

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
it from a grassland regime

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
into a very um different sort of pebbly

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
regime

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
so when i was thinking about this

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
variational ecology i was kind of

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,479
thinking about

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
the desert ecosystem and and the

145
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
southwest

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
and go ahead muddy

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
um so i'm interested in a slightly

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
different non-biological

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
ecosystems uh but still ecosystems where

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
we have

151
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,880
agents that make decisions so we build

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
our micro service meshes by

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
having multiple agents that can make

154
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
decisions and can decide for themselves

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,280
whether they

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
are appropriate to a given computation

157
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
or not so we treat them as ecosystems

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,000
and we

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
are using active inference very much to

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,919
model the the life cycles of these

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
various micro services

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
cool and if anyone else wants to raise

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
their hand muddy i'm actually

164
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
just kind of curious let's go to steven

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
first and then i'll follow up if

166
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,919
possible yeah i'm interested in kind of

167
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
intentional spaces but learning spaces

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
or workspaces and one

169
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
thing that really came up for me was

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
when i was in a place called

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
inguavuma at poncini school

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,160
back in 2004 when i visited there

173
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
and to do a project or just at that time

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
just to engage the community

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
i it was at a school then ponchini

176
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
school in a rural area

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
where they'd only just built the school

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
10 years before so they didn't actually

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
have schools there before that

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,960
and um in in and

181
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
you know around the outside you've got

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
the fence with the barbed wire on the

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,560
top

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
in the middle of this area with no

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
electricity and it was

186
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
and i i i sensed at that time there was

187
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
this kind of disconnect between

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
the students understanding what this

189
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
niche was that they were

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
immersed in and an area where

191
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,599
um you know while they're learning stuff

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,120
there's also 35

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
hiv and big challenges

194
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
and and this kind of learning

195
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
environment which was kind of

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
coming from a colonial background so i

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
this this kind of

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,960
difference between the world which i was

199
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
seeing in that community in the world in

200
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
this

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
this school kind of you know as i've

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
seen in certain workplaces you see this

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
kind of disconnect this kind of like

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
learning isn't just the knowledge it's

205
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
something about how to fit it together

206
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
and that's when i so later became this

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
idea of a social topography whether

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
somehow what's that kind of landscape of

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,039
meaning and

210
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
when is it more than just knowing the

211
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,879
facts and i think that's where the

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,080
ecosystem

213
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,360
sort of comes together cool i like how

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
we're exploring a lot of these types of

215
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
ecosystems and those are definitely what

216
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,400
we want to

217
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
encompass in the variational ecology

218
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,440
discussion

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
sasha

220
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
um yeah so i'm interested in the micro

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
environment

222
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,039
that neurons grow up in and

223
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
how that affects their activity levels

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
and how they make connections with

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,319
others

226
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,879
so one of the things that i'm studying

227
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,360
for that

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
is how different immune molecules

229
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
and turning on immune genes

230
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
affects this process and this is

231
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
something that i want to learn from this

232
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,799
paper um how to apply that to my own

233
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
system

234
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
but one parallel i'm also thinking about

235
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
is

236
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,679
uh the immune landscape um

237
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
when people are isolated and aren't

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
exposed to as many people what their

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,959
kind of immunity is like um

240
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,399
especially in a time when we're really

241
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
thinking about our own health and

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
immunity

243
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
ooh just from writing down some of these

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
little notes there's ecosystems across

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,480
scale

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
that's definitely going to come back and

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
then there's this idea of community

248
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
ecology

249
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
which in the bio sense is usually about

250
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,240
different species

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
but then there's of course as steven was

252
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
talking about this group and historical

253
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,320
dynamics to our community ecology

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
and then ecosystems that are of

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
different technologies

256
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
so the second warm-up question is what

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
is something that you're curious about

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,240
or want to explore in today's discussion

259
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
and while people are raising their hand

260
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
i think the question that almost

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
motivated or seems to motivate this

262
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
paper is the one i'm curious about which

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,800
is about applying

264
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,839
the free energy principles formalisms to

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
larger scale systems where potentially

266
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,720
the stability of the markov blanket or

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
some of the other dynamics of the system

268
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
are so rapidly changing that it um

269
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
really questions how we're going to

270
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
study it from this framework

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
and i know that's something that we'll

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
return to

273
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,240
muddy yeah i i think what's fascinating

274
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,760
um from from this work that maxwell has

275
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,000
been

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
doing is is helping us actually get

277
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
really fine-grained detail onto the

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,279
computational currents of certain

279
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,399
problems such as

280
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,399
you know when do i stop modeling my

281
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
subsystem and when do i start

282
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
representing my subsystem as

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
a parameter so when you know this

284
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
transition between a parametric approach

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
and a modeling approach to then feed

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
into a hierarchical model

287
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
that is uh quite a it's quite an art and

288
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,240
it's an

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
ill-posed sort of problem so i think

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
this work is really really fascinating

291
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
from that perspective

292
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
from me personally cool maybe

293
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,320
maxwell i'd be curious what is that

294
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,600
relationship with the

295
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
parametric and the modeling approaches

296
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
like how do we go about

297
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
exploring that or what does that mean

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
from a modeler's perspective

299
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
i'm not sure i understand your question

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,560
um like

301
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
muddy was talking about how this uh

302
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
question of modeling like when to stop

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,360
and

304
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
when to include a parameter at one level

305
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
versus another what's

306
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
an introductory thought or what's the

307
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,440
rationale or the motivation behind doing

308
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
that kind of a thing

309
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
i mean so mel andrews has thought about

310
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
this a lot more than i have

311
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
i mean uh i wish they were here

312
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
um that they're sick today so i mean

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,120
roughly speaking the generative models

314
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
that we employ under active inference

315
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
uh they harness the what mel has been

316
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,399
calling the existential variables of the

317
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,519
system

318
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
uh so you know the the variables that

319
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
actually make a difference

320
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
to uh survival uh

321
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
so you know you can think of stuff like

322
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,720
a core body temperature

323
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
and so on i mean ultimately there is

324
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
always going to be an arbitrariness

325
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
uh involved in the modeling effort

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,040
because we have to make

327
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
kind of science science side decisions

328
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,920
about what are the relevant things that

329
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
we're going to model or not

330
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,320
but that said there do seem to be some

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
some variables that are more critical to

332
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
the continued existence

333
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,079
of the systems that we're interested in

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,320
so i don't know if that addresses the

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,200
point

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
cool i think we'll return to it

337
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,320
especially as we think about

338
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
what are the vital signatures or the

339
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
vital variables for ecosystems because

340
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
we want to be thinking about them in

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,639
this

342
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
similar framework cool here we go

343
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
so the paper that we're going to be

344
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
discussing in 7.1 today

345
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,440
and in 7.2 last week as well as in 7.0

346
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,160
last week

347
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
uh yeah people can figure that one out

348
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,360
is

349
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
variational ecology in the physics of

350
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
sentient systems by ramstead

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
constant badcock and firsten and the

352
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
goal of the paper

353
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
was stated as reviewing a framework for

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
modeling complex adaptive systems for

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
multi-scale

356
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
free energy bounding organism niche

357
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,320
dynamics

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
thereby integrating the modeling

359
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
strategies and heuristics

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
of variational neuroethology or vne with

361
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
a broader perspective on the ecological

362
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,480
nestedness of biotic systems

363
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
we extend variational neuroethology

364
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
beyond the action perception loops of

365
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
individual organisms i.e active

366
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,079
inference

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
by appealing to the variational approach

368
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
to niche construction

369
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
to explain the dynamics of coupled

370
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,760
systems constituted by organisms

371
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
and their ecological niche and so i

372
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,519
quoted that directly from the paper

373
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,720
because i think it's a really

374
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
direct representation and foreshadows

375
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,959
the fusion

376
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,920
of the vne and the va nc which we can

377
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,560
talk about

378
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
but to kind of rephrase that in non-fep

379
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,800
language it's a question about how can

380
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,360
we make

381
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,079
a multi-level or multi-scale ecology

382
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,880
framework

383
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,839
that builds upon eco evo devo that's

384
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
ecology evolution and development

385
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
but also adding in insights from physics

386
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,760
mathematics and complexity or complex

387
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
adaptive systems

388
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,920
so it certainly is an ambitious scope

389
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
and it's kind of linking together this

390
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,880
organism and

391
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
downward story of the variational

392
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,399
neuroethology

393
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
with the niche construction aspect so

394
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
kind of we have the organism looking

395
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
downwards that's the neuromolecular

396
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
components of behavior

397
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,079
and then we have the organism looking

398
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,560
upwards and outwards with the ecology

399
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
yeah if i could comment on that briefly

400
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
yeah so the basically the if you're

401
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
looking at like the history of how this

402
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
came about

403
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,120
um so i was working

404
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,160
i mean between 2000 i guess 16 and 18 i

405
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,519
was mostly focused

406
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,079
on developing uh you know this

407
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
multi-scale

408
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
active inference story in large part

409
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,199
with carl fristen

410
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,000
and that resulted in a framework that we

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
called a variational ethology or

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
variational neuroethology

413
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
in our 2018 physics of life reviews

414
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,079
paper

415
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,320
um answering short ingress question free

416
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,839
energy formulation

417
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
and so the the variational neuro

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
mythology is essentially

419
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,720
uh a theory about the kind of if you if

420
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
you want to think about it like

421
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,160
um visually a kind of vertical stack

422
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,839
of systems we've discussed this on this

423
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
podcast before but like this idea that

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
systems are made of nested systems of

425
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
systems so that

426
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,199
essentially if you look at the ontology

427
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,199
of a system what you have is a stack of

428
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,360
segregated

429
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
systems of different spatial spatial and

430
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,279
temporal scales

431
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
that affect effectively compose each

432
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
other so cells composing

433
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
tissues composing organs composing

434
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,959
organisms composing

435
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
social groups and composing species and

436
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
so on

437
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
and so following the publication of that

438
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
paper i started working closely with

439
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
axel constant

440
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
who uh was riffing off work that yella

441
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
brinaberg had been doing

442
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,759
in amsterdam uh with his group over

443
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,480
there

444
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
and uh axel and i developed um

445
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,800
a basically a niche construction account

446
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,519
of

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
active inference what we highlighted was

448
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
the fact that active inference is a

449
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
symmetric formulation in the sense that

450
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
it tells a story about how internal and

451
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
external states attune to each other

452
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
internal states of tuning to external

453
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
ones through things like perception and

454
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,079
and learning and phenotypic

455
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,759
accommodation and development

456
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,920
and external states tuning to internal

457
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
states through action notably

458
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
making the world more like uh the way

459
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
that we expect it to be

460
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,920
so that gave us a kind of horizontal

461
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,279
dimension where basically

462
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
at every kind of level of this uh

463
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,279
vertical stack

464
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,360
which you have is effectively a

465
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
relationship between

466
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,079
uh an ecological niche and the denizens

467
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,279
or inhabitants

468
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,800
of that ecological nation so

469
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
this paper uh aimed to combine both

470
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
frameworks uh so the niche construction

471
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
stuff and the nested systems of system

472
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,880
stuff

473
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
into a kind of principled uh approach to

474
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,160
biological systems

475
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
uh and so you know moving from an

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,160
ethology

477
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
and a theory of niche construction so

478
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
ethology being the study of animal

479
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,639
behavior

480
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,639
essentially so combining these two

481
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,000
things into a bona fide

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,160
theory of ecology uh using the

483
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
variational free energy principle

484
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,520
i'm sure you're going to mention this

485
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
after but the last ingredient that we

486
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,559
added to this mix

487
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
is the skilled intentionality framework

488
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
from the amsterdam group

489
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
eric groupveld julian kieverstein

490
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,720
uh yellow greenenberg what they add to

491
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
the mix

492
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
with the skilled intentionality stuff is

493
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
connecting this predictive

494
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,640
processing framework to the the

495
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
ecological psychology

496
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,280
notion of affordances um yes so this

497
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
paper essentially takes

498
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,120
the ecological psychology stuff on

499
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
affordances the so-called skilled

500
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,000
intentionality framework

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
the variational ethology and the

502
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
variational niche construction stuff and

503
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
proposes this integrative model

504
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,120
uh yeah so that's the kind of history

505
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,840
awesome

506
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
great summary thanks so much maxwell and

507
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,600
just to kind of

508
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,559
restate that in this nested framework

509
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,160
you have the

510
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
bottom up or emergence features of the

511
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
system you have the top-down

512
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
features of the system and then the

513
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
lateral are kind of like the collective

514
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,919
behavior

515
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
so we're thinking about all these

516
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
ingredients that maxwell just mentioned

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
especially coming from the skilled

518
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,559
intention intentionality framework and a

519
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,919
few other areas bringing them all

520
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,799
together

521
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,440
so let's check out the abstract this

522
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,360
paper addresses the challenges faced by

523
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,039
multi-scale formulations of the

524
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,840
variational

525
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
or free energy approach to dynamics that

526
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
obtain for large scale ensembles such as

527
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
ecosystems or

528
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
groups of organisms we review a

529
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
framework for modeling

530
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
complex adaptive control systems for

531
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
multi-scale free energy

532
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
bounding organism niche dynamics thereby

533
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
integrating the modeling strategies and

534
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
heuristics of variational

535
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
neuroethology which remember was really

536
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,679
focused on the organism's feedback with

537
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
its local affordances

538
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,200
with a broader perspective on the

539
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
ecological nestedness of biotic systems

540
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
so like a lot of times in this podcast

541
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,679
we've talked about the affordance of

542
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,200
getting a jacket or of changing the

543
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,039
thermostat but that's actually

544
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,280
part of the constructed niche of humans

545
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
it's not just a human in a box it

546
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
doesn't find themselves without

547
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
affordance

548
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
unlike these some of the biomechanical

549
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
affordances perhaps

550
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,679
we extend the multi-scale variational

551
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,679
formulation beyond the action perception

552
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,440
loops of individual organisms

553
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
by appealing to the variational approach

554
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
to niche construction

555
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
to explain the dynamics of coupled

556
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,240
systems constituted by organisms and

557
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
their ecological niche

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
and that relates to the symmetry that

559
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
was being discussed a few minutes ago

560
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
we suggest that the statistical

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
robustness of living systems is

562
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,400
inherited

563
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
in part from their eco-niches as niches

564
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
help coordinate dynamical patterns

565
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,200
across

566
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
larger spatiotemporal scales we call

567
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
this approach variational ecology

568
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
so it's kind of like the affordance of

569
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,120
driving in a car

570
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
is part of the constructed niche of the

571
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,320
highway network and then that

572
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,440
shapes the movement patterns we argue

573
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,840
that

574
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,760
when applied to cultural animals such as

575
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,480
humans variational ecology enables

576
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
us to formulate not just the physics of

577
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
individual minds but also a physics of

578
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,159
interacting minds across spatial and

579
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,280
temporal scales

580
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
of physics of sentient systems that

581
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
range from cells to society

582
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
and this should sort of invoke that

583
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
warm-up discussion about the different

584
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
kinds of ecosystems

585
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
especially when talking about humans and

586
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,840
our technologically enabled extended

587
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,000
niches

588
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
part of the ecosystem is informational

589
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,679
it's symbolic

590
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,600
and so we also want to be thinking about

591
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
information ecologies in the way that

592
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,679
these dynamics apply not just to the

593
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,039
ants on the pebbles

594
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,919
but also to humans and the paths through

595
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,280
the parks that are discussed in the

596
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,840
paper

597
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,679
and also ways that long-range

598
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,120
technological communication

599
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,080
might come into play so just to briefly

600
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,919
run through the road map this paper is

601
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,600
zero indexed which i found very

602
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
interesting and it starts with a

603
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,240
discussion

604
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
of the variational or free energy

605
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,600
formulation

606
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
and just briefly reviews active

607
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
inference and generative models it's

608
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,720
really great that every paper

609
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
sort of starts with this uh section on

610
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,240
just

611
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
what it is that we're talking about with

612
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,679
active and fvp

613
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,120
they're so annoying to write though

614
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,360
honestly you know you don't want to you

615
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
don't want to plagiarize you don't want

616
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,080
to just copy the paragraphs you've

617
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,720
written

618
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
uh it's like how many ways can you

619
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
explain the same thing you know

620
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
and it's like a if there really is a

621
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,679
smooth

622
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
energy landscape underlying these

623
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
explanations

624
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
we're treading many many paths and

625
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
exploring many on-ramps turning these

626
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
ideas around through discussion and

627
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,600
through

628
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,559
more papers so yeah there's a repetition

629
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,000
element and there's also

630
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
potentially a way that we make bigger

631
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,760
and more accessible explanations by

632
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
rephrasing it

633
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
again and again for different journals

634
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
or different specialties

635
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
so then the second section is on

636
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,159
variational neuro anthology and

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,880
that brings into question uh multi-scale

638
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
levels of analysis as well as ensembles

639
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
of markov blankets as well as a few

640
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
figures that we'll scan through

641
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,360
the third section introduces the sort of

642
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,080
organism

643
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
and upwards perspective that is given by

644
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
the niche construction the variational

645
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
approach to niche construction

646
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,000
and relates that to ontologies of

647
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,679
affordances some of which we've talked

648
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,200
about in previous discussions as well

649
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
another figure on the bayesian mechanics

650
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
and active inference

651
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,120
and then as usual with these papers

652
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,240
there's sort of the

653
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,679
foundation then idea a and idea b

654
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
and then i a and b are linked together

655
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,039
and so we get to

656
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
section four variational ecology the

657
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
physics of shared mites

658
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
and this also relates to discussions

659
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,960
we've had about

660
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,559
what it is that's modeling is the

661
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,799
organism a model of its environment does

662
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
have a model and agreed that mal's

663
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
thoughts on this are

664
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
super helpful and then there's some

665
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
concluding remarks

666
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
and just to really quickly visually

667
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
outline this

668
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,080
theory by addition approach that's being

669
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
enacted here

670
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,640
on the very bottom we have the fep which

671
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
is that paradigmatic ground rock

672
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
that a lot of these other theories are

673
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
going to be built on top of

674
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
then from left to right we have active

675
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
inference tin bergens four

676
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
questions which are explored a little

677
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
bit in

678
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
number 7.0 as well as some previous

679
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,480
discussions we've had

680
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,120
est is evolutionary systems theory which

681
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,919
is basically

682
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
evolutionary biology with a systems

683
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
perspective and eco evo devo

684
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
which is also a very interesting and

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
rich area that emphasizes that

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
the way that evolution occurs is not

687
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
just ecologically embedded and enacted

688
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
but it occurs through changes in

689
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
development so you don't just get a

690
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
longer femur

691
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
you get the developmental proclivity to

692
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,679
have your growth plate be open for a

693
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,880
longer or shorter time

694
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,799
resulting in a phenotype that is

695
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,240
changing but it's changing through

696
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
development

697
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
active inference and tin brokens for

698
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
questions and evolutionary systems

699
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,080
theory

700
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
were basically summated this is not a

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
perfect summation it's just sort of

702
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
building it up a little bit to vne which

703
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
was a very organism and biobehavioral

704
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,120
centric approach to explaining action

705
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,520
perception loops of organisms

706
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
on the other hand also drawings from

707
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,559
actinf was the

708
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,840
variational approach to niche

709
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,919
construction which drew a little bit

710
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,760
more extensively from the eco

711
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
evo devo motivating questions and

712
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,279
literature

713
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,400
and then to bring in synergetics which

714
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
is this relationship between the higher

715
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,360
order

716
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,919
uh parameters the bigger slower things

717
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,679
and then the lower level parameters the

718
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,279
faster and smaller things

719
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,640
of hakan 1983 on the left side uh

720
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
and then the collective behavioral

721
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
approach these lateral relationships

722
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
between nested systems

723
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,080
it all kind of comes together to get to

724
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
variational ecology

725
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,279
which hopefully builds upon the

726
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,120
strengths of all of these different

727
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
antecedent theories

728
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
and gives us something that is going to

729
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,919
allow us to dip back

730
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,159
into for example behavioral explanations

731
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,360
of organisms or

732
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
dip into the niche construction approach

733
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
or the collective behavior across

734
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,279
different levels of analysis as well as

735
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,480
providing a helpful

736
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,200
path back to understanding how previous

737
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
formulations

738
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,520
for example a modern synthesis type

739
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
evolutionary biological explanation

740
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,200
or a non-fep eco evo devo explanation

741
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,360
it gives us an interpretation path that

742
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
we can walk

743
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
to understand a lot of the previous

744
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
literature so let's just

745
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,039
pause here does anyone have any thoughts

746
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,760
on this

747
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
theory summation or is there any other

748
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
areas that we think might be relevant to

749
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
draw in

750
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
one that i was wondering about is this

751
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
introduction of the minds

752
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
and the sentient systems and so there

753
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,960
was a sentence in the paper about the

754
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
sentient systems being

755
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,039
sensory systems though often when people

756
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,880
talk about the search for sentient life

757
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,919
and things like that

758
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,400
they're talking about the experiential

759
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
dynamics as well and so

760
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,799
the idea of getting the interacting

761
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,840
minds

762
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
from the interacting evolutionary

763
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,880
systems

764
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
i just thought that was kind of a

765
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,559
curious thing maybe foreshadowing in

766
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,840
integration with psychology or with

767
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
phenomenology

768
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
well so the the sentience aspect is

769
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
really i think just to highlight what

770
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,679
the

771
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
the free energy principle stuff does i

772
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
mean at the end of the day

773
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,919
uh the free energy principle shares with

774
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,240
perceptual control theory the idea that

775
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,679
action is about

776
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,320
uh the control of perceptual input

777
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,240
namely keeping it within certain bounds

778
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,000
um so that might be relevant to uh

779
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,159
to consider i mean yeah so from that

780
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,080
point of view sentience

781
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,400
is uh the capacity to be affected

782
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
uh by the world in a way that

783
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
allows us to control how the way

784
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,840
the world affects us yep like something

785
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
hitting a rock still could be felt or

786
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
is is still as influential on the state

787
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,039
of the rock but

788
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,799
it doesn't necessarily have the ability

789
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
to then act especially in a proactive

790
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,320
way

791
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
to get around that and also just one

792
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
other note is

793
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,080
actually the schrodinger's question

794
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,640
paper

795
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
from 1944 and then the answering

796
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
schrodinger's question paper from 2018 i

797
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,559
think are also

798
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,440
great places for people who are kind of

799
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
coming at this from a first principles

800
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
of biology perspective because

801
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
schrodinger's question was about how

802
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
organisms

803
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
are organized and very interestingly and

804
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
nine years before the discovery of the

805
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,480
structure of dna

806
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
and many years before a lot of the other

807
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
approaches that would come on the scene

808
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
with a molecular revolution

809
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
in the second half of the 1900s

810
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
schrodinger said

811
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,840
there has to be something like a

812
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,720
quasi-periodic crystal

813
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,600
and organisms have to organize at least

814
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,240
locally

815
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,520
they're not going to violate the laws of

816
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
physics this isn't vitalism but at least

817
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,679
locally you have to be able to take you

818
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,640
know the

819
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
bag of sugar and then organize it into

820
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
biomolecules that constitute an organism

821
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,559
that's a

822
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,720
increase in order how does that happen

823
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
is that the defining principle of life

824
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,600
and in some ways as we look on earth and

825
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,360
elsewhere for life these two

826
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,399
ideas of schrodinger really uh

827
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
remain as prescient as ever so i find

828
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
that just really interesting

829
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,039
stephen i know you're probably going to

830
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,880
mention this but i suppose the idea of

831
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,039
ergodicity sort of comes in through the

832
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
active inference

833
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,240
peace more than it normally thought of

834
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
in the other areas

835
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,120
but that maybe synergetics isn't

836
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,760
another way that these kind of ergodic

837
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
um ways to extract information at

838
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,840
present and i suppose the question is

839
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
is that non-ergodic processes the ways

840
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,360
to tap into things which are non-ergodic

841
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
and sort of causal

842
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,240
is that something which is when you then

843
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,640
step

844
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,159
outside of normal active inference and

845
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,200
you have this extra

846
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
structure on top which is our cognition

847
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
which allows us to

848
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
sort of process things that are kind of

849
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,919
non-ergodic so i think that might be

850
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,600
interesting like in terms of how we

851
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
construct things as humans as opposed to

852
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,279
that kind of more organic niche

853
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,799
construction but that

854
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
not that that's really touched on here

855
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,880
but i suppose it's just just the idea of

856
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
how patterns are extracted and what

857
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,840
levels of meaning or what processes of

858
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,200
like attuning or constructing or

859
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,360
relating what what's that kind of

860
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
dynamic at play

861
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,640
thanks for that comment i think the word

862
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,120
ergotic is really what a lot of that

863
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
idea hinges on so if anyone wants to

864
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,399
have a

865
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,960
take at what the word ergotic means i

866
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
tried to go through it a little bit

867
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
in 7.0 but um

868
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,159
if anyone wants to explain what an

869
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:44,880
ergotic

870
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
system is and stephen what your question

871
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
gets at is really whether the models of

872
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,320
ergotic systems

873
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,240
of systems where the time average is

874
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,080
equivalent to the ensemble or the

875
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
spatial averaging

876
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
um though there's also other ways to

877
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,679
phrase that or perspectives on that

878
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
in systems with extreme historiosity

879
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,720
like niche construction if you build a

880
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,799
road in one place the whole society kind

881
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,080
of leverages around that

882
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,760
or if there's an introduction of a new

883
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,279
species into an area

884
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,080
that can irreversibly and extremely

885
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,760
historically change the trajectory that

886
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,559
ecosystem

887
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,880
so how are we to model these systems

888
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
using ergotic frameworks

889
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
steven and then anyone else who wants to

890
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,679
step in on the ergotic

891
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,880
question because it's kind of a key term

892
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
yeah i was i think this is a really

893
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,799
interesting i thought of a relevant

894
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,279
point

895
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
because the thing with ergodicity is i i

896
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
sort of was

897
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
looking at the video for this session

898
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,440
that you made and sort of comparing it

899
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
to what i've been thinking is

900
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,399
it could be that there's lots of small

901
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,720
patches or periods or blocks where

902
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,440
there's kind of

903
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,480
enough ergodicity due to mixing

904
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
to extract information or to find

905
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,679
patterns

906
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,399
so it could be that there's not this

907
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,200
idea that the system is ergodic

908
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
but there might be lots of times where

909
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
there's moments of mixing that

910
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,960
ergodicity is present and you can

911
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
extract

912
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
or make inferences from that so i think

913
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
that's quite

914
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,880
um that changes things a little bit in

915
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,159
terms of how

916
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,320
you know makes it more plausible maybe

917
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,600
for how ergodicity

918
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,640
can creep in um

919
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
and it also i think then starts to give

920
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,279
you a rationale for how you

921
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,200
can engage with the whole entropy

922
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
question as well and

923
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
because normally entropy is brought into

924
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,760
this equation

925
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,080
talking about multiple levels and things

926
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,480
dissipating and suddenly it's like well

927
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
um if you've got periods of ergodicity

928
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,200
then you can you you've got a way

929
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,279
to extract or

930
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,480
get get a grip on the noise that's going

931
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,240
on out there over time

932
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
um and and i think that that that's

933
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,559
important i think that's also important

934
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,440
in terms of

935
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,039
trying to explain it to other people

936
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
because most people

937
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,360
when they think about the world and

938
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,559
systems i'm actually

939
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
there's a whole debate on the vibrant

940
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,760
systems

941
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,840
group about this is that they kind of

942
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
they just take a snapshot of perspective

943
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
on a system

944
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,880
and they say this is what the system

945
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,559
does but

946
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,080
that's not the same as something which

947
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
is happening over time

948
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,440
and there's a pattern over time it's

949
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,039
like it's a different way of thinking

950
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,320
about

951
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,440
the world and even think about systems

952
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
in general so

953
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,679
that that that piece is really important

954
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,279
about how does it happen over time and

955
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,159
is it lots of

956
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,360
bits of ergodicity that add together or

957
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,679
is

958
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
is it like we have to have ergodicity

959
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,480
over 100 years over 10 years over five

960
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,039
years

961
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
nice let's go shannon and then muddy and

962
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,679
then maxwell if you want

963
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,480
i i would just like to jump in quickly

964
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
just to clarify a few things about

965
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
ergodicity if that was okay

966
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,039
uh let's go yeah you might actually

967
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
answer my questions before i ask them

968
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
perfect shannon muddy go ahead okay so

969
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
ergodicity from a mathematical point of

970
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
view

971
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,440
you can understand it heuristically as

972
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,840
the

973
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
you know so a system is ergotic if

974
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,519
the average of our measures of the

975
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,320
system

976
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
converges to a measure of the average of

977
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,679
our the value of whatever we're

978
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,720
measuring so

979
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,320
another way of thinking about it is that

980
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
like wherever your system starts in its

981
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,679
state space

982
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,960
with an ergotic system it will end up in

983
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
in a regime of characteristic states

984
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
like so

985
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
so no matter where you start you end up

986
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,080
uh

987
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,120
in in these uh in these states so i mean

988
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,279
you know you can think of

989
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,880
uh you know my the my

990
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,960
my body temperature for example would be

991
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
describable in this

992
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,039
way you know it varies a bit but it ends

993
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,519
up

994
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,320
continuously converging to 36 and a half

995
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
degrees celsius

996
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,200
so there's a lot of confusion in the

997
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,840
literature and in discussion

998
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,960
about this ergodicity thing um one thing

999
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,919
to point out

1000
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,839
is that uh so to the extent that it is

1001
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,280
implied in the framework uh the

1002
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,879
the notion that we're considering is

1003
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,280
only local ergodicity so we're not

1004
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
saying that

1005
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,719
uh you know because the maximal version

1006
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,359
of like an ergotic system

1007
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,440
like a system that's globally ergodic is

1008
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,879
a system that doesn't really have a

1009
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,520
history

1010
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,719
in the sense that it doesn't really

1011
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,119
matter where you start you always end up

1012
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,399
in the same place

1013
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,119
um the notion of ergodicity that we're

1014
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,599
employing in the free energy framework

1015
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,760
to the extent that it's employed at all

1016
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,320
is the notion of local eradicity which

1017
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,119
means that

1018
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,639
uh on some appropriate temporal

1019
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,199
and spatial scale uh it's useful to

1020
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,560
think about the system

1021
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,960
as being ergotic as in that it will

1022
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,599
regularly converge to the same

1023
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,079
uh set of states or values of those

1024
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,200
states rather

1025
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,880
um so i guess there's a lot to say here

1026
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,599
on on the one hand um you know this

1027
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,520
local ergodicity thing

1028
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,160
uh is important so when we say that the

1029
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,040
earth is

1030
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,560
uh is round you know

1031
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,320
uh we're we're not saying that it's not

1032
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
flat enough locally for us to build

1033
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
buildings on it

1034
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,359
uh so like locally the the earth has

1035
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,280
it has fl is flat enough has a

1036
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
negligible enough curvature that we can

1037
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,359
build for example a building on it

1038
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
and this is the same kind of idea so the

1039
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,280
the ergodicity at play

1040
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
is that you know on some appreciable

1041
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,640
time scale

1042
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,200
systems converge to the same set of

1043
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
values effectively

1044
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,079
and uh yeah so i guess that's

1045
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,440
uh one point another related point is

1046
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,680
that

1047
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,359
ergodicity actually isn't um

1048
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,839
they well it's it's not really baked

1049
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,520
into the free energy principle

1050
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,000
all you really need uh to get the free

1051
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
energy principle running is a markov

1052
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,880
blanket

1053
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,119
and a non-equilibrium steady state or

1054
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,800
generative model which we've been

1055
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,720
discussing over the last few weeks

1056
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,440
so generally notions like ergodicity and

1057
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,560
weekly mixing

1058
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
also appears in some of these

1059
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,560
discussions it only applies to certain

1060
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,079
kinds of systems with

1061
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,119
multiple multiple particles under

1062
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,720
special assumptions

1063
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
namely the assumption that all the

1064
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,760
particles are exchangeable

1065
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
um so if we're dealing with a single

1066
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,760
particle this kind of probability

1067
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,000
distribution in general doesn't exist

1068
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
the only probability distribution

1069
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,640
uh to which we have access is when we

1070
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,480
sample the state of a single particle

1071
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,839
over time

1072
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,359
um so yeah the the real

1073
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,440
assumptions on which the free energy

1074
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,640
stuff is built

1075
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,839
is this non-equilibrium steady-state

1076
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,280
assumption um

1077
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,480
i mean and it's related to the

1078
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,640
ergodicity thing in this in a certain

1079
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,440
sense

1080
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,040
um so non-equilibrium steady state we're

1081
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,359
we're saying that you know the system

1082
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
has a set of characteristic states to

1083
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,560
which it it

1084
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
tends you know over time uh

1085
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,119
and so if if a system has uh

1086
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,680
a non-equilibrium a steady state then

1087
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,119
you know under the conditions that we

1088
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,320
just described or

1089
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,520
there are particles that are

1090
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,599
exchangeable then uh you can treat the

1091
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,960
system as ergotic

1092
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,320
but it's it's not it's not as crucial to

1093
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
the framework as some would suggest so

1094
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
like i i've heard

1095
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,400
in the you know in the bushes that uh

1096
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
some people are mounting a critique of

1097
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,240
the free energy principle based on the

1098
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,119
idea that

1099
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,119
uh living systems aren't actually

1100
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,240
ergotic

1101
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,000
i think that's a bit of a waste of time

1102
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
because we're not we're not claiming

1103
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,400
that

1104
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,640
biological systems are globally ergodic

1105
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,240
just that it's useful

1106
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,760
to treat them as their gothic uh

1107
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,839
at certain scales and you know the way

1108
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,599
that we get get out of this kind of

1109
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,560
weird

1110
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,599
place formally speaking is by pointing

1111
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,079
to this

1112
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,040
nested systems of systems thing so the

1113
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,760
idea is that

1114
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
from the perspective of any layer of the

1115
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,280
system the layer above it might as well

1116
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,560
be stationary

1117
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
so from the point of view of my bo of my

1118
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,320
cells for example

1119
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,640
my body is essentially stationary you

1120
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,680
know so

1121
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,960
their entire life cycle you know from

1122
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,079
birth to uh cell division

1123
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,040
uh will occur without any major

1124
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
structural change happening to

1125
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,520
the non-equilibrium steady state of my

1126
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
whole body

1127
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,760
so you know you you you get around

1128
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
the implausibility of the strong

1129
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
interpretation of these assumptions by

1130
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
pointing out that well what's actually

1131
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,839
at play is a nested

1132
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,040
series of systems and you know

1133
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,400
you you only need things to look ergotic

1134
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
locally relative to other layers of the

1135
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,720
system

1136
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
i think that's really helpful for what

1137
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,400
my question would have been

1138
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,880
which would be like how would if you're

1139
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,119
talking about the behavior of a crowd

1140
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,359
and if there's a certain markov blanket

1141
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,640
that can extend over this

1142
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,280
this group of individuals um the thing

1143
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
about a crowd is it's not a cell that's

1144
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,160
not bounded by

1145
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,920
being stuck inside of a body they could

1146
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
leave like they could leave the stadium

1147
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
or leave the protest

1148
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,640
but if we're talking about ergotic or

1149
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,400
like interacting just enough at just the

1150
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,599
right spatial temporal scale then

1151
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,079
we can talk about some markup blanket

1152
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,040
over some

1153
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
whole crowd or subset of a crowd at some

1154
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,400
event at some time

1155
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
exactly yeah that's precisely what's

1156
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,680
going on here so

1157
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,280
it's all about defining the relevant

1158
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,119
spatial and temporal scales i mean if

1159
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,400
your relevant spatial

1160
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
and temporal scale is like you know the

1161
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
whole city over several weeks then

1162
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,599
obviously the the protesters that gather

1163
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,240
you know and spontaneously form a social

1164
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,359
group wouldn't count as

1165
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,040
you know even having a non-equilibrium

1166
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
steady state i mean it just kind of

1167
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
forms and dissipates

1168
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,680
but if you're looking over the scale of

1169
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
you know minutes to

1170
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
maybe hours then it does make sense to

1171
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,560
say well locally

1172
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,880
you know there's something robust here

1173
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
it has a statistical independence from

1174
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
its environment it seems to be

1175
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
you know attracted to the same set of

1176
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
states and then it dissipates

1177
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,680
so so it's the same story over and over

1178
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
again just a different kind of spatial

1179
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,800
and temporal scale so you're totally

1180
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,079
right i think shannon

1181
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,560
that's right right on point cool let's

1182
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,520
do muddy

1183
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,200
and then stephen uh yeah i just wanted

1184
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,040
to speak to some of the like just to

1185
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
give a little bit of intuition so i'm

1186
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
kind of

1187
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,400
not super in active research right now

1188
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
so these terms i i like

1189
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,440
sharing kind of the way i think about

1190
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,960
them for people who might be listening

1191
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,280
who

1192
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,960
might not be familiar with the like

1193
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,640
ergodicity in general

1194
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,839
so just generally i i and please correct

1195
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,200
me if i'm wrong about this because i'm

1196
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
looking to have my understanding probe

1197
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
but i view ergodicity or a system that's

1198
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,319
got it

1199
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,119
um my intuition is that if i take a

1200
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,800
sample of a system

1201
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
that system is ergodic if that sample is

1202
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,800
representative of the greater dynamics

1203
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,760
of that system

1204
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,280
so that's what maxwell was saying about

1205
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
tending to the mean so it doesn't really

1206
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,640
matter if i take my data from here here

1207
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,599
here or here

1208
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,200
as long as the sample i'm taking is

1209
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
representative

1210
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,800
um that there's another camera worms it

1211
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,560
should tend to the same mean

1212
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
or you know basically represent the same

1213
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,079
dynamics of the underlying

1214
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,400
model and underneath but the way in

1215
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
which you define

1216
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
ergodicity is actually defined by your

1217
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,440
your measurement

1218
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,520
your sample space it's necessarily

1219
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,040
defined by your sample space so

1220
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,240
you have all of these emergence

1221
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
properties which are hard to pin down so

1222
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,880
you have

1223
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,079
like dynamic ergodicity which which are

1224
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,560
you know partials with respect to time

1225
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,359
which

1226
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,280
tend towards some stable value for the

1227
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,960
local and then the actual mean

1228
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,720
versus static ergodicity which is if i

1229
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,000
take a snapshot of my

1230
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,160
system at any one given time so like a

1231
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,119
cloud of gas

1232
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
it kind of looks the same but without

1233
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
any knowledge of my attractor systems i

1234
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
can't say that my system is ergodic

1235
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
dynamically over time

1236
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,000
um and then you can think about

1237
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
continual ergodicity at different levels

1238
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,200
so um i think the example maxwell gave

1239
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
with flat earth is a really really

1240
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,800
beautiful one because if you take a

1241
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,040
local representative sample say

1242
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,160
100 meters by 100 meters

1243
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,560
you you could define every single sample

1244
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,079
by a single function

1245
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,920
uh a stable function which either has

1246
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
either a stability maximum point

1247
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,640
or is linear in its nature so at that

1248
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
level i have a continuous function which

1249
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,359
defines

1250
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,599
ergodicity across all scales but it's

1251
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,760
part it's nested within a larger system

1252
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,560
which might have

1253
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,000
chaotic dynamics actually and so it's

1254
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,079
it's actually ergodicity i think the

1255
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,280
ambiguity comes in

1256
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,480
when you're actually trying to define

1257
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,319
the problem space itself

1258
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,440
as a concept it's just basically saying

1259
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,960
this sample represents the model i'm

1260
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,640
trying this sample

1261
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,880
of a larger system represents the

1262
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,760
largest system

1263
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,599
at whatever mathematical perspective i

1264
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,960
happen to be looking at it from

1265
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,480
whether it's with respect to time or

1266
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
some other variable so i just wanted to

1267
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,200
add that

1268
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,319
in i mean just to play devil's advocate

1269
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,839
thank you buddy for that i agree with

1270
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,079
everything you said uh just to make

1271
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,359
the uh you know put some meat on the

1272
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,440
bones of criticism and the interest of

1273
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
fairness

1274
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,000
one of the reasons that you might resist

1275
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,839
the idea that biological systems is

1276
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,599
ergotic is for example

1277
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,160
uh the pretty plain fact that evolution

1278
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,520
isn't going anywhere

1279
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,000
right there doesn't seem to be some kind

1280
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
of evolutionary

1281
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
kind of attractor basin towards which uh

1282
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,760
all of evolution you know

1283
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,880
uh contra this kind of anthropocentric

1284
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,720
uh you know religious view of you know

1285
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,000
man's place in nature well humans aren't

1286
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,839
all that special um and

1287
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,839
we're uh we're just like one among

1288
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,119
uh you know a series of other

1289
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,160
uh animals um yeah so

1290
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
that wait one quick before we go to

1291
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
stephen also if your body temperature

1292
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,079
hits a certain very low or very high

1293
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,839
value it's not returning to a steady

1294
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,720
state either

1295
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,160
and so that's like there's a lot of

1296
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
reasons to think at a certain scale of

1297
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,720
analysis

1298
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,480
that there's violations of this kind of

1299
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,079
behavior stephen i mean

1300
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,839
very clearly we all die right yeah we

1301
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,760
all dissipate and so

1302
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
at long enough time scales nothing is uh

1303
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,200
hasn't

1304
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,800
has like this non-equilibrium steady

1305
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
state or is ergodic in that sense right

1306
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,280
like we all

1307
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
we all just dissipate you know in some

1308
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:24,880
sense the

1309
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,920
the the only real ultimate ergotic

1310
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,839
you know end point is the heat death of

1311
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,599
the universe right so

1312
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,119
yeah it's uncanny valley because at a

1313
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,800
short time scale you're stable then at

1314
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,560
the lifelong time scale you dissipate

1315
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,119
and then

1316
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,359
again you're just a flash in the pan so

1317
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,560
very cool

1318
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,319
and highlights that it's important what

1319
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,079
scale we're talking about steven before

1320
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,560
we close out the slide

1321
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,720
yeah i also think that you know we talk

1322
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,880
about the system is the system ergodic

1323
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,599
internally externally but i don't know

1324
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,119
whether this is right but i kind of

1325
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,960
i'm more from a practice perspective

1326
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
trying to do the sense making

1327
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,839
of active inference and that kind of the

1328
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:02,880
dynamics of

1329
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,680
things going backwards and forwards so i

1330
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
i'm trying to think of

1331
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,240
the ergodicity as maybe more about the

1332
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,440
process of this noisy

1333
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,800
chaotic like muddy was saying data

1334
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,720
going backwards and forwards or across

1335
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
the markov blanket

1336
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
and within there there's ergodicity

1337
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,680
in that you know within and then that

1338
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,599
even if the systems i don't know whether

1339
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,119
they are or not ergodic

1340
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,280
of the organism but there's something in

1341
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,960
the data stream that allows you to

1342
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
extract information from

1343
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,560
the entropy the sort of the noise so i

1344
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
was trying to work out if

1345
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,319
you know that that might be two

1346
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,079
questions here i think it ends up going

1347
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,520
to this bigger question about whether

1348
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
the systems are ergodic but i'm not sure

1349
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
whether it's about

1350
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,119
the dynamics the non-linear dynamics

1351
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,720
have ergodicity sort of

1352
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,960
tucked away in there yeah just to give

1353
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,040
an ecological example let's think about

1354
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,720
a predator prey relationship

1355
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,200
like a latka volterra model you know the

1356
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
cougars and the rabbits or something

1357
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,520
like that

1358
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,359
so it's always changing through time and

1359
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,200
there's a winnerless competition where

1360
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
they're always oscillating

1361
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,960
and so from the first pass the first

1362
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,440
moment it's not ergotic it's changing

1363
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,839
at certain time scales but it has what

1364
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,079
muddy was referring to as this dynamical

1365
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,480
stationarity or the dynamical ergodicity

1366
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,920
it's kind of like the more things change

1367
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,520
the more they stay the same

1368
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,280
sometimes when we're talking about these

1369
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,680
higher order relational dynamics

1370
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,119
or rates of change the partial

1371
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,800
derivatives that muddy mentioned

1372
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,040
then it's actually through time at the

1373
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,880
correct time scale of analysis

1374
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
that you see see that the predator prey

1375
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,079
relationship is in like this

1376
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
higher order ergodicity and then at

1377
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
another time scale above that

1378
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,280
the predator and the prey species don't

1379
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,520
even exist so of course it can't be an

1380
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,119
ergotic system so again

1381
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
we see that there's time scales where

1382
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,400
systems display ergodicity

1383
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,319
and time skills and spatial scales where

1384
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,319
they don't as well as relying on

1385
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,000
questions about exchange ability

1386
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,960
and other attributes but just in the

1387
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,520
last

1388
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400
couple minutes this is really awesome

1389
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,359
discussion

1390
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,440
i want to just run through the figures

1391
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,119
give people a little peek

1392
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,359
into some of the formalisms and the

1393
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
ideas that we'll be talking about

1394
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
further in 7.2

1395
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,160
and this is a quotation about

1396
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,640
how exactly niche construction enters

1397
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,359
the picture

1398
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,359
and especially in terms of epistemic

1399
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
resources which relates to the

1400
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,880
technological niche of humans

1401
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
as well as the skilled intentionality

1402
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,319
framework

1403
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,040
here's a good quotation about how in the

1404
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,559
multi-scale framework

1405
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
active inference is a group behavior

1406
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,079
that's a group activity

1407
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,160
and so this sort of connects the dots

1408
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,760
between active inference and collective

1409
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,559
behavior

1410
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,960
because even when we draw the organismal

1411
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,559
loop with active inference we're talking

1412
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,240
about collectives of neurons or of

1413
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,720
different

1414
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,440
cell types and also ties it back to

1415
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,760
closed causality circular causality

1416
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
and synergetics this idea of

1417
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,720
coordinating slower order parameters

1418
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,800
and then rapidly oscillating higher

1419
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,319
order parameters and that's kind of like

1420
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:02,720
the

1421
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,960
the dynamics of the gas cloud looks

1422
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,040
stationary visibly but if you went down

1423
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,240
there it'd be the seizing

1424
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
seething mess and you'd say there's no

1425
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,599
way this is a stationary state but it is

1426
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,440
at a little bit of a higher level

1427
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,559
and then um this last quote was just

1428
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,040
about

1429
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,200
how um at work one's behavior

1430
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,680
acts to justify their sensory states and

1431
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,520
their prior beliefs about them

1432
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,480
and then that kind of reminded me of a

1433
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,720
figure from the paper written with

1434
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,920
alex and sasha and others where we

1435
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,359
talked about that a little bit more

1436
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,400
specifically from a

1437
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,520
technological level um and

1438
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,599
just to quickly walk through the figures

1439
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,800
before we return

1440
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
figure one marco blanket it's gotta be

1441
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,040
figure one it's not it's not a ramstead

1442
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,640
paper if it isn't

1443
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,359
figure two is also unpacked a little bit

1444
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,040
in the answering schrodinger's question

1445
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,680
paper and this one there's what you see

1446
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,040
and there's what you don't see

1447
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,640
what you see is the potential

1448
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
explanatory scope

1449
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,240
across spatial and temporal scales that

1450
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,160
range over many orders of magnitude

1451
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,319
but what you don't see is that there's

1452
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,160
nothing that's at the for example

1453
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,800
one millisecond and one kilometer scale

1454
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,319
maybe a lightning strike is able to

1455
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,359
dissipate energy

1456
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
rapidly at that scale but it doesn't

1457
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,720
coordinate effectively it doesn't have

1458
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,520
that closed

1459
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,720
causality i should say uh but like

1460
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,960
i no longer agree with this figure uh

1461
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,640
casper has been i

1462
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,760
starting may 2018 uh

1463
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,640
i guess uh so casper uh was quick to

1464
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,000
point out that you don't

1465
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,680
you don't need a separate set of time

1466
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,040
scales the

1467
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,440
the spatial scales that we pointed out

1468
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,160
are really

1469
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,000
ontological scales so like the

1470
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,599
subcellular scale

1471
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,400
is a spatial scale and a temporal scale

1472
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,480
uh simultaneously so

1473
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,280
uh you know the cellular processes occur

1474
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,960
over a few milliseconds and

1475
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,119
yeah they have their specific size and

1476
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,040
these these scales like

1477
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,079
uh the the concomitant like

1478
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,319
associated spatial and temporal scales

1479
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,119
really increase along this diagonal

1480
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,319
uh kind of together um so

1481
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,160
i mean another thing that kind of breaks

1482
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,040
this uh apart is where is culture here

1483
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,839
right so culture is very fast uh but

1484
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,760
it's also very large scale

1485
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,800
a process so uh this is not a figure

1486
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,520
that i would

1487
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,359
recommend like learning by heart or

1488
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,280
anything i think it turns out to be

1489
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
wrong now but

1490
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,760
science progresses right so yep we were

1491
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,559
wrong

1492
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,400
i still find it interesting especially

1493
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,559
with that caveat that it's not like

1494
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,839
there's small things happening

1495
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,400
at the tiny scale and then there's no um

1496
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,839
relationship with the niche construction

1497
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,280
like niche construction for the cultural

1498
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,119
niche and the communication niche

1499
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
is related to cellular processes so

1500
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,559
there's just what's happening

1501
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,000
but then it's interesting to think about

1502
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,280
how the functional levels of

1503
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,240
organization

1504
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,839
do align along this very

1505
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,880
vague qualitative diagonal but not a

1506
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,240
formal approach for sure here figure 3

1507
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,559
is another recap figure having to do

1508
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
with i think something about broccoli

1509
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,400
and how it's a fractal now it's about

1510
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,800
markov blankets and about nested systems

1511
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,040
and how markov blankets at one level

1512
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,800
can be thought of as engaging in

1513
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,280
collective behavior at a higher level

1514
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,000
figure four again an example that we've

1515
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,960
seen before

1516
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,599
with looking at how morphology can arise

1517
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,000
as a function of initially equivalent

1518
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,040
cells acting morphologically to reduce

1519
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,880
their surprise about their expectations

1520
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,800
about the extracellular gradients

1521
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,400
and where they are and what that means

1522
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,079
for what the organism is doing

1523
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,400
and then how development and the

1524
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,800
evolution of development could reflect

1525
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,520
beliefs and action generative sequences

1526
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:39,839
that

1527
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,480
allow the organism to fulfill functional

1528
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,920
morphologies

1529
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
figure five i don't think is one that

1530
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,520
we've seen yet

1531
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,400
um but it connects the active inference

1532
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,920
and a ford inside with a free energy

1533
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,720
minimization

1534
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,520
side and there's some mathematics there

1535
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
that i hope to be actually going into

1536
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
in the coming weeks as we've chosen the

1537
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,119
paper for eight which is going to be

1538
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,640
scaling active inference

1539
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,119
and we'll be looking to have a lot of

1540
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,280
discussion on the mathematics because

1541
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,359
um it's definitely one of the areas we

1542
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,040
want to dive deeper into

1543
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,280
and then the last figure is a partition

1544
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,480
of vector states

1545
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,520
into particles which are the the um the

1546
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,160
sets of balls here and um the blanket

1547
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,800
states

1548
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
so i'll go into that a lot next week

1549
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,040
this is probably the key figure

1550
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,119
perfect for the whole thing thanks for

1551
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,559
noting that we'll definitely

1552
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,520
go into this um in the uh last minute

1553
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,760
thanks for participating in this short

1554
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,079
and exciting 7.1

1555
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,640
next time in 7.2 we're going to have

1556
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,480
more time to talk about some of the

1557
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,280
specific

1558
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,960
questions that have been arising as well

1559
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,520
as figure 6 as maxwell pointed out

1560
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,640
everyone live or in replay is welcome to

1561
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,559
send us comments or questions that would

1562
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:53,760
be cool to unpack

1563
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,680
live today i really appreciate just

1564
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,440
hearing about how these different

1565
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,520
ecosystem conceptualizations and

1566
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,480
ways of thinking about the same

1567
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,559
ecosystem same way of thinking across

1568
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,920
different ecosystems how do they all

1569
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,359
combine

1570
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,000
and we provide follow-up forms to all

1571
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,520
live participants so it's in the

1572
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,319
calendar

1573
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,839
invite and it'd be great if you could

1574
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,520
fill it out we also

1575
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,440
solicit feedback suggestions and

1576
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,559
questions from

1577
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,160
our audience and from our other

1578
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,559
participants who aren't live here

1579
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,760
and uh all we can say to that is

1580
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,599
thanks for the participation thanks

1581
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,800
everyone really

1582
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,680
an awesome discussion and just as always

1583
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,559
it's another

1584
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,800
level of understanding another coat of

1585
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,319
paint on the mural to hear from

1586
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,599
everyone's perspective so i

1587
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,359
deeply appreciate that and great times

1588
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,760
anyone want to give a uh singular

1589
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,440
closing thought to cap out the stream

1590
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,119
long live ergodicity muddy go for it

1591
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,839
oh i was just gonna say no

1592
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,920
exactly can i ask you a question

1593
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,640
that's my observation perfect thanks

1594
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,480
everyone thanks again for listening for

1595
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,920
participating and we will

1596
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,800
see you next time
