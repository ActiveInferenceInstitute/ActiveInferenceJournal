this is a recorded and archived live

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,360
stream

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,040
please provide us feedback so that we

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
can improve our work all backgrounds and

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
perspectives are welcome here

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
video etiquette for live streams is that

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,280
you want to mute

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
if there's any sound in your background

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
raise your hand if you want to

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
speak so you can be added to the stack

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,199
use respectful speech etc

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,159
today in act imp stream 7.0

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,880
i'm going to try to set the context for

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,119
7.1 and 7.2

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
which is going to be a discussion of the

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,680
paper variational ecology and the

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
physics of sentient systems by ramstad

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,560
at

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
all 2019 in physics of life reviews

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,159
this video as the other dot zeros are is

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,280
just an introduction

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
to some context it's not a review or a

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
final word

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,079
the goal is to provide context for the

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,720
ideas

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
philosophical threads and vocabulary of

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
that ramstead at all

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,320
paper go through some other points as

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,240
well and the punch line

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
is that ecosystems are multi-scale

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
systems with implications for how we

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,799
study

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
ecological organization and

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,600
the sections of 7.0 will be as follows

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,759
first we'll go through the keywords and

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
talk about some of the publication

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
context

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
go through the goals of the paper the

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,759
abstract of the paper and the roadmap of

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,799
the sections

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
go through some key quotations and then

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,560
talk a little bit about

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
ergotic systems some critiques of the

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
free energy principle

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
the simulations and historiosity and how

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
that influences

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
how we think about ecosystems and also

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
the cog ergo sum

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
then in 7.1 and 7.2 we're going to

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
discuss this paper with whoever wants to

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
participate so you can also save and

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
submit your questions

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
or get in touch with us if you want to

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
participate

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
also and thanks for the suggestion

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
to uh feedback was to how to relate this

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,800
to previous discussions

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
so if you want previous discussions to

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
listen to that relate to this

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
conversation

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
one would be active stream two is the

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
free energy principle a formal theory of

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
semantics because this

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,599
discussion and paper was asking can we

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,560
use the fep

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
to study meaningful systems so both the

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
ones that matter for us

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
the meaningful systems for us but then

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,519
also the meaning making the autopoetic

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,959
systems

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
another discussion was 5.0 and the 5.1

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
and 2 discussions

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
which are the context for this question

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
about internalism and externalism

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
which is a question about how and where

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
action and perception occur

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
are they internal to an organism or do

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,599
they

95
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
occur in this space that's mediated

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
between the external environment and the

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,239
internal environment

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
and then also this most recent 6.0

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
and following discussions where we

100
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,840
talked about tale of two densities

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
active inferences and active inference

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,599
because there we talked about how

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,680
inactive or ecological approaches are

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
broadly linked with computational

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
approaches like does one have precedence

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
over the other

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,159
all right so there's a lot going on in

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
this variational

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
ecology paper so

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
we're going to start here with the

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
keywords so

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
there will be pages for each of these

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
but here's the keywords that were

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,159
on the paper niche construction so niche

115
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
construction

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
is when some system of interest like an

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,280
organism

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
over developmental or ecological or

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,439
evolutionary time scales

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,519
modifies its environments it's pretty

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,040
broad and we'll talk more about it

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
in a bit variational ecology

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
they're using variational in a sense

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
here to mean just broadly multi-scale

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,199
and then akin to the processes of

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,080
variational

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
bayesian methods which are kind of like

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
general multi-scale methods

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
so they're thinking about ecology from a

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
multi-scale

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
perspective with a sort of flexible

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,840
computationalist

133
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,160
aspect as we've seen from those previous

134
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
discussions

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
evolutionary systems theory is uh

136
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,400
basically just evolutionary biology

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
probably some people prefer

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
revolutionary biology or evolutionary

139
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,400
systems

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
theory not exactly sure they're

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
pretty equivalent physics to the mind

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
will have a slide

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
to discuss because there's a few

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
different senses of what physics of the

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
mind entails

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
free energy principle of course one of

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
the key words here because that's

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
sort of the big framework or the

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,199
paradigm that everything is being

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,800
worked on or responded to under

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
and then variational neurology we'll

152
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,960
talk about more

153
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
soon but variational again here is just

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
meaning multi-scale

155
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
ethology no it's not ethereum it's

156
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
actually behavior

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,720
and neuro just meaning the

158
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,639
neurophysiological component so this is

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
kind of like neuro behavior

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
and thinking about the the cause and

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,160
effect between the

162
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,199
neurophysiological parameters whether

163
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
the neural or hormonal

164
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
and the behavioral outcomes and the

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,840
collective behavioral outcomes

166
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,360
all right so let's turn to ecology first

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
here's a quote from the paper they wrote

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
in summary the niche transcribes

169
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
regularities that pertain to group

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
behavior they are transcribed in the

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
physical layout of the niche

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,039
through the active and perceptual

173
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,800
dynamics of the agent

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
which coincides with perceptual and

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
active dynamics of the niche

176
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
the same dynamics entail the landscape

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
of action possibilities which are

178
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
affordances

179
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,880
which maintain the structural integrity

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,479
of the agent knees system

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
niche dynamics resolve the free energy

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
gradients that are induced by the

183
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
physical structures

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
of organisms in their niche and their

185
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
history of dense interaction and dynamic

186
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,080
coupling

187
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
in this sense the robustness of patterns

188
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
of shared intentionality and an action

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
of shared meaning is inherited from the

190
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
robustness of niche

191
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
and vice versa so to kind of ground this

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
in some other more

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
non-fep ecology here's a 2014

194
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
paper by deborah gordon

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
and here's two figures that illustrate

196
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
this point that i'll make which is

197
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
that there's going to be sort of this

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,319
hand in glove relationship

199
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
between the dynamics of the ecosystem

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
and the resulting collective behavioral

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
and quote individual behavioral

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
algorithms that exist

203
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
and first off the variational approach

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
or just the multi-scale approach

205
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
means that it's kind of collective

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,680
behavior all the way down like inside of

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
that ant on the bottom right

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,759
there's also a collective of neurons or

209
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,720
you know it's

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
just going to be that type of a

211
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
interactions of different scales all the

212
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
way down that's sort of the variational

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
realization is that it's all going to

214
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
have to be at least coarse grained

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
at the high in the low end if not tried

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,080
to

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
uh be modeled explicitly but

218
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
we can at least draw a border of

219
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,520
analysis

220
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
around an ant and track it as

221
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,199
something that we can identify as a

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,960
functional component of the system

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
and so in the two figures there's

224
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
two examples of axes of ecosystem

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
variability

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
so on the right side figure one it's

227
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
patchiness in space and time

228
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
so in a where the resource is

229
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,879
distributed really

230
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
uh evenly across space then there

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,800
wouldn't be any type of

232
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
mass recruitment pheromone because

233
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
there'd be no reason to bring an ant to

234
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
where you just got that one little blip

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,199
whereas under ecological regime b

236
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
it would make sense to have something

237
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
like a recruitment regime

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,240
because it could be an exploitable

239
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
resource that might be patchy in space

240
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
and time

241
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
uh and you might see ants that could

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,479
switch different strategies

243
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
however one ant species may specialize

244
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
on one or the other

245
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
in figure two it's an example of a high

246
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
versus low

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
operating cost environment so when

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
operating costs are high

249
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,959
things are tending to be off until

250
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
they're stimulated on like a fever

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
because operating costs of a fever are

252
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
high whereas when operating costs are

253
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,360
low

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
like for example the maintenance of leaf

255
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
cutter ants under certain conditions in

256
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,560
the rain forest

257
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
to maintain territory versus the

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
bioenergetics of moving let's just say

259
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
under one example that uh is often

260
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
brought up here until there's a

261
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,519
disruption there's a continuation of

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
function

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
so this is sort of a similar realization

264
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
to what is described in the paper that

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,640
there's this

266
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
statistical covariation between the

267
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
collective behavioral algorithms

268
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,160
and the niche regularity here is another

269
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,519
paper by professor gordon in 2011

270
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,160
called diffusion of behavioral ecology

271
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
and

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
ecology um so on the left are just a

273
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
bunch of animals a bunch of things that

274
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
people have studied and then ethology

275
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
again is just kind of a funny

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
word that is used by some behavioral

277
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
biologists but not all but this is kind

278
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,279
of an

279
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,279
example of the different range of things

280
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,800
that people have worked on

281
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,080
in that area specifically and

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
one cool quote from this paper was until

283
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
someone discovers a fossil record

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,360
for behavior we can in practice only

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
investigate

286
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
what are the ecological consequences of

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
a trait now that is the evolutionary

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
ecology of behavior

289
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
so we can sometimes see for example

290
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,600
this you know an amber that traps uh one

291
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,240
insect

292
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
capturing another one we can say okay

293
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
this pickup move may have happened one

294
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
time or it may have been frequent

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
but all we have from a behavioral

296
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
observational perspective are actually

297
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
the live realizations of today and so

298
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,519
the implications are that because the

299
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
local rules of engagement and ecology

300
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
can change

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
it appears that selection shifts in

302
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,200
space and time so we know that selection

303
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
pressures can

304
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
go in one direction or have a certain

305
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
intensity on one trait and then

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
change in a different year or in

307
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,279
different time

308
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
this is why behavioral ecologist who

309
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
studies the ecology of a trait in one

310
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
time and place will find the outcomes

311
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,839
different than another

312
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
the main project of evolutionary ecology

313
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
is to understand when and why that

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,120
happens

315
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
the effects of local conditions on

316
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
species interactions create different

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
ecological pressures in different places

318
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,839
this produces the spatial mosaic of

319
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
diversity and then another

320
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
quote there was context dependence

321
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
requires us to redefine the project of

322
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,600
relating behavior and fitness

323
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,760
it is not realistic to hope to find any

324
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
reason why any trait would always be

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,480
adaptive

326
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
any trait behavioral or otherwise is

327
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
deeply linked to others genetically

328
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
developmentally and functionally

329
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
and if so of no trait so no trait has

330
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
ecological impact independently of all

331
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,959
others

332
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
moreover even if we can ascertain what

333
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,000
variation

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
in certain certain behavior is

335
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,279
associated with variation and

336
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
reproductive success

337
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
changing conditions will still shift

338
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
around that relation so that's um

339
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
non-stable or non-stationary fitness

340
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,079
landscapes

341
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,680
adaptive landscapes are full of small

342
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
bumps and the behavior itself modifies

343
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
the landscape

344
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
if we watch long and carefully enough we

345
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,399
will see different consequences for

346
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,920
reproductive success of the same

347
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,720
behavior

348
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
the project then is to learn how

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,639
conditions determine the ways that

350
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
behavior contributes to variation in

351
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
reproductive

352
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
success so behavioral ecology

353
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
already there's the realization that

354
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,079
it's important to think about this

355
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,160
interplay between features of the

356
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,519
organism as a

357
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,320
ethological unit neurobehavioral unit

358
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,720
but

359
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
also at the ecological the population

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
scale and the evolutionary scale

361
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
all right a little bit more specific

362
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
about niche construction

363
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
drawing a figure from this paper by

364
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
kendall adult

365
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
niche construction is a pretty broad

366
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
term and a lot of

367
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
outcomes and processes can be placed

368
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,560
under this

369
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,240
framework it has to do with the way that

370
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
organisms modify

371
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
their niche and this is almost

372
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
uh always going to be the case when you

373
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,040
have

374
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
con specifics in individuals of the same

375
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,399
species because

376
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,760
almost by definition they're going to be

377
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,839
taking up an overlapping

378
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,360
you know set of the canopy uh elevation

379
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
in a rain forest or foraging preference

380
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
and so this diagram shows how

381
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,040
you can have natural selection operating

382
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
to shape based on instantaneous relative

383
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,680
fitness

384
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,959
the distribution of the strategies or

385
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
genotypes and phenotypes on the right

386
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
this great line coming down here

387
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,600
that's genetic inheritance but then also

388
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,639
you have the

389
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,560
outcomes of collective behavior which

390
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
are influenced by

391
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
the changes in the genomic and

392
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
epigenomic

393
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,399
and niche and developmental factors and

394
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
cultural factors

395
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,000
then influencing the way that natural

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
selection shapes

397
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,000
that and that can be through semantic

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
information or through physical

399
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
resources like

400
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,720
uh eusocial insect colony so

401
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
one example here of a cool niche

402
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,160
construction

403
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,000
this is a clearing in a rain forest

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
and the clearing comes from these ants

405
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
that trim that live within a specific

406
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,920
plant and trim the ground around it a

407
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
series of paper

408
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
the devil to pay a cost of mutualism

409
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,680
with uh

410
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,399
mira militista schumanniai ants in

411
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,360
devil's gardens

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,760
in increased periphery android hirsuta

413
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
trees by frederick gordon so like

414
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
this paper is saying there's ecological

415
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,600
trade-offs

416
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
so it's just it's representing a

417
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
different strategy and there's

418
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,279
obviously a reason why these devils

419
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
gardens don't just

420
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,959
proliferate and sweep across the whole

421
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,000
area they

422
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
clearly have limiting factors so it

423
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,519
makes sense to study

424
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,760
the bigger context and understand what

425
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
these limiting factors are

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
and where they break down rather than

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
just say well it's just simply a good

428
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
strategy so it's always going to be

429
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
about kind of a bigger level of analysis

430
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
as well

431
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,079
all right kind of broadening from

432
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,040
ecology

433
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
to ecological psychology this

434
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
is related to some

435
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,120
often human-centric obviously as

436
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
psychology

437
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,790
might tend to be um

438
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,880
[Music]

439
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
modeling of systems around people

440
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,440
and we were all children and so there's

441
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
a developmental aspect

442
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
there's also these immediate to indirect

443
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,399
aspects of our system so there's a

444
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,720
multi-scale and a multi-time

445
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
aspect to ecological systems theory and

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,320
also

447
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
on the more direct psychological side

448
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
there's this three-way diagram

449
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
that comes from a 1976 paper

450
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
and there's it's sort of like a cycle

451
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
you have the on the starting on the

452
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,320
bottom left

453
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
the schema is what directs action and

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
what action accomplishes is exploration

455
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
what exploration does is it samples what

456
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,959
does it sample

457
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,920
it samples percepts like oculomotor

458
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,199
sampling and stimuli what does that do

459
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
it modifies your schema what would be

460
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
identified in the free energy as the

461
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
internal model

462
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,079
and ecological psychology also

463
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,440
is where we get the development of ideas

464
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
like affordances and the fields of

465
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
affordances the skilled intentionality

466
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
framework

467
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,399
what the organism or system can do and

468
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
that can reflect

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
technology as well so in our constructed

470
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,079
niche that can be technological

471
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,880
embedding

472
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,199
and this image is nice because it shows

473
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
the clarity of the phone the hyper

474
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,720
reality of the phone

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
in relationship to the blurriness of the

476
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,639
embodied

477
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
and so uh it captures that what's at

478
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,120
hand

479
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,759
what we can act on what we're using for

480
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,040
information

481
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,839
that can overwhelm our field of

482
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,639
performances

483
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
term that i definitely had to look up

484
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
and think about a few ways

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
that it applied was this physics of the

486
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,160
mind

487
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
i was just like okay what is that gonna

488
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
mean

489
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
and i think that there's a few different

490
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,919
ways i'm i'm happy if someone has a

491
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,760
another way to add or if there's a more

492
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,240
specific way to state it but

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
one sense of physics of the mind is that

494
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,599
there's a search for

495
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
lawful rules and simple equations for

496
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,880
the mind

497
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
to make neurosense in some sense more

498
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,079
like some people's conception of physics

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,919
so that there would be a loss of motion

500
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
or an invariance principle or symmetry

501
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
principle

502
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
or a relationship with some other

503
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,679
uh physics equation for the mind

504
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
another branch of physics for the mind

505
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,360
is that

506
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
whether or not it is what the brain

507
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
really does

508
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
that this branch of engineering

509
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
oriented analysis of neurosystems would

510
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,760
facilitate the development of systems

511
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
engineering and complex systems

512
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
and control systems so kind of like

513
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,280
applied physics

514
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,400
being engineering that's sort of where

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,039
these uh

516
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,919
micro sensors and brain computing

517
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,880
interfaces

518
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
are at it's at the implied physics level

519
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,919
and then another sense of physics of the

520
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,480
mind

521
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
is that there might be some

522
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
understanding of the physical basis

523
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
slash substrate of the mind which is

524
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
kind of the hard question of

525
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,039
consciousness

526
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,880
and it also relates to questions like

527
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
soft matter physics and crystals

528
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
quantum microtubules what what kind of

529
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
quote computation is being done in the

530
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
brain what is the brain doing

531
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
these are all kinds of questions that uh

532
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
is you know is it an

533
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
antenna or a processor is there is it

534
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
which metaphors and which aspects of

535
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,240
them are instructive in that regard

536
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,039
and the big question i'm sorry that all

537
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,440
of these

538
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,120
senses of physics the mind are getting

539
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
at is can

540
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
because the mind is explicitly a

541
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
metaphysical thing as opposed to the

542
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,360
brain

543
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
is can metaphysics join with multi-scale

544
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,919
systems neuroscience physics molecular

545
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
genetics

546
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
evolutionary ecology etc

547
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,520
then they mentioned you know in the

548
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
title

549
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
that it's the variational uh

550
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
ecology physics of sentient systems so

551
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,960
what are

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
sentient systems because initially i

553
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,799
think i had the wrong

554
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,720
reading here so vne in the vanc which

555
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
we're going to get to in a second

556
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
are about enabling the application of

557
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,919
the fep to phenomena within

558
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
and beyond the brain these approaches

559
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
hold the promise of extending the

560
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,000
variational

561
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,919
free energy approach to the dynamics of

562
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,000
sentient systems i.e

563
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
systems with sensory states across

564
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,520
spatial and temporal scales

565
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
so this is not a paper or a discussion

566
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,919
on consciousness or awareness this is

567
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
going to be about emergence

568
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
in multi-scale biosystems which is

569
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
a pretty compatibilist with either

570
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
interpretation

571
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
but this sentient it doesn't mean

572
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,919
awareness

573
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
it's not about tearing tests it's about

574
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,280
sense

575
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,679
systems so this is about being able to

576
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,880
model simpler

577
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,799
sensing systems you know thermometers

578
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,400
and that type of control system

579
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
in a very simple way but also more

580
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
nuanced systems like

581
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,200
other organisms in a more rich way

582
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,280
all right so how do we get here what is

583
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
the literature

584
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
context for this variational ecology

585
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
paper

586
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,960
the fep has recently been leveraged to

587
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
furnish a fully generalizable meta

588
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,600
theory

589
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
for adaptive behavior in sentient

590
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
systems across spatial and temporal

591
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
scales called variational

592
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,320
neuroethology so let's talk about

593
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,360
what is vne because this paper is going

594
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
to reference it a lot

595
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,919
what is vne and what scales or types of

596
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
phenomena does it model

597
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
so we're going to get to ve variational

598
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,880
ecology

599
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
via vne variational neuroethology

600
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
by contextualizing within a critique

601
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
that leads to this paper

602
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,080
so in phys life review 2018

603
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
there's a paper by ramp citadel

604
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
answering short english question which

605
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,840
is what is life

606
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,640
1944 a free life formulation

607
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
now that paper led to a bunch of

608
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
responses

609
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,799
which led to the clarification

610
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,679
on some of these responses and sort of

611
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,640
the drawing out

612
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
of this variational neuroethological

613
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,440
approach and one quote

614
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
that arises from the paper the

615
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,000
schrodinger's paper

616
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
was given the success of this

617
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
explanatory framework in biology we

618
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
suggest that tim bergen's levels of

619
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
inquiry might be apt to elucidate

620
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,039
structural

621
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
laws that supplement the general

622
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,880
principles provided by the fep

623
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
the fep describes a general biological

624
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
modeling imperative walton virgin has

625
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
offered a distinctive but complementary

626
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
framework that allows us to develop

627
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,320
substantiative

628
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,159
explanations for the phenotypic traits

629
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
and behaviors of any given species or

630
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
organism

631
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
and so here is the 1963 paper by tim

632
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
burgin and then a

633
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
50 years update by bateson and lot

634
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
and we talked about this in one of the

635
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
previous

636
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,320
discussions but this is a two by two

637
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
grid that represents tim bergens

638
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
for quote wise it's kind of like

639
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
aristotle's four why's

640
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
it's about having multiple different

641
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,400
kinds of explanation

642
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
that are at different types and

643
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
different scales of analysis

644
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,440
so the historical how how did this

645
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
organism get here

646
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
is development and how did it get here

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,400
in the very

648
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
short term the contemporary how is like

649
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
the ultimate mechanism how did my arm

650
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
get here because it moved from this

651
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,840
other place

652
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
ultimately or more a little bit more

653
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
historically but approximately it

654
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,360
got here because it was an arm bud and

655
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
then the contemporary why is the

656
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,840
function

657
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
like what does the thing do right now

658
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
just at this moment like why is there a

659
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
mouse on my desk so i can use it

660
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
and then historically why like why is

661
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,320
there a mouse on my desk

662
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
why is it as opposed to not using a desk

663
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,919
or not using a mouse

664
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,679
because of evolutionary processes so

665
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,440
that's a little bit of a broader level

666
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,159
question

667
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,960
so that kind of compatibilist among uh

668
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,039
compatibilism amongst answers

669
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,840
is going to be complemented by a way to

670
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,480
specifically connect multiple levels

671
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,760
through potentially even more formal

672
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,520
or uh modeled or testable

673
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,159
ways of thinking about the relationship

674
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
between these four categories

675
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,960
thus constituting you know a complete

676
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,559
answer at least within this

677
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,919
four-fold framework that's been very

678
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
helpful so

679
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
that is where variational ecology comes

680
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
in

681
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
we're going to talk about it in the

682
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
context of building on

683
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,919
vne and what that is too so the paper is

684
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,760
variational ecology and the physics of

685
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,640
sentient systems

686
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
in physics of life review 2019.

687
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
ramstead constant bad and fristen

688
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
so the goal of the paper and again we're

689
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
going to return back to these things

690
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,120
so is specifically we review a framework

691
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,080
for modeling

692
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,000
complex adaptive systems for multi-scale

693
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
free energy bounding organism niche

694
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
dynamics

695
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,240
thereby integrating the modeling

696
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,159
strategies and heuristics of variational

697
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,039
neuroethology

698
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
vienne with a broader perspective on the

699
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
ecological nestedness of biotic systems

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
we extend vne beyond the action

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,159
perception loops of individual organisms

702
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,559
i.e active inference by appealing to the

703
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,919
variational approach to niche

704
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,840
construction va and c

705
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
to explain the dynamics of coupled

706
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,360
systems constituted by organisms and

707
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,960
their ecological niche

708
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
so the big question is how can we make

709
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
a multi-scale ecology framework that

710
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,760
builds upon

711
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,240
eco evo devo and also adds insights from

712
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,080
physics and mathematics and complexity

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
so first part of the abstract this paper

714
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,760
addresses the challenges faced by

715
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
multi-scale formulations of the

716
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,320
variational

717
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,480
or free energy approach to dynamics that

718
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,960
obtain for large-scale ensembles

719
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
we review a framework for modeling

720
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
complex adaptive control systems for

721
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,480
multi-skill free energy bounding

722
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
organism niche dynamics

723
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
thereby integrating the modeling

724
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
strategies and heuristics of variational

725
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,880
neuromythology

726
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
with a broader perspective on the

727
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
ecological nestedness of biotic

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
systems so they're as i said

729
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,120
stated in the second part here it's

730
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
going to be a framework which is theory

731
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,600
plus

732
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
tools that's going to be about modeling

733
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
complex adaptive systems as control

734
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
systems

735
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
what are they going to be controlling

736
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
something about the free energy

737
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,039
boundedness of their own interactions

738
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,000
with their niche

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,799
so rather than just thinking about how

740
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
the physiological or the neuro

741
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
aspects are related to constraints on

742
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
behavior

743
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,799
it's now also about behavior looking up

744
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,880
we extend the multi-skill variational

745
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
formulation beyond the action perception

746
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,480
loop of individual organisms by

747
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
appealing to the variational approach to

748
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
niche construction

749
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
to explain the dynamics of coupled

750
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
systems constituted by organisms and

751
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,440
their ecological niche

752
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
we suggest that the statistical

753
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,720
robustness of living systems is

754
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
inherited in part from their eco-niche

755
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
as niches help coordinate dynamical

756
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
patterns across larger spatial temporal

757
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,039
scales

758
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
we call this approach variational

759
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,480
neuroethology

760
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
we argue that when applied to cultural

761
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,679
animals such as humans

762
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,000
variational ecology enables us to

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,840
formulate not just the physics of

764
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
individual minds but also physics of

765
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
interacting minds across spatial

766
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,960
temporal scales

767
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,799
a physics of sentient systems that range

768
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,640
from cells to society

769
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,279
so briefly here's the roadmap section

770
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:45,679
zero

771
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,720
is the introduction they first talk

772
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,440
about

773
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,000
the variational or free energy

774
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,880
formulation

775
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
and specifically about how active

776
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,159
inference models and generative models

777
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,520
are related to it we're not going to go

778
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,640
through the figures in this

779
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
discussion though the second part of the

780
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
paper is about variational neuroethology

781
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,240
which is about how ensembles of markov

782
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,799
blankets underlying the organismal level

783
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,919
uh facilitate the

784
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,720
organism niche environment that was sort

785
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
of the neuroethology level of analysis

786
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,399
then they take that sort of organism

787
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,360
upwards

788
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,600
view of niche construction with

789
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,799
variational approach to niche

790
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,840
construction and the ontology of

791
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,520
affordances

792
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
and reach the variational ecology which

793
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,799
is really just connecting these two

794
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
at the organism and just making it a

795
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,520
multi-scale ecology and then subsuming

796
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,840
the behavioral component within it

797
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,320
all right so to

798
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,440
get to variational neuroethology

799
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,240
especially if this is um

800
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
new learning about active inference and

801
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,600
how it relates to

802
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,520
other areas in neurobiology some of the

803
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,080
comments about variational neuroethology

804
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,279
from

805
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
other um

806
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,679
authors in response to the articles and

807
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,279
just

808
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,640
points and comments that are really

809
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,000
sometimes apparent other times not

810
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
in the literature but areas for

811
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
improvement in theory one thing that's

812
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
cool about the active inference area is

813
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
it really draws people back to these

814
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,960
fundamental questions

815
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
that really were long term about top

816
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
down or bottom-up forces for example in

817
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,279
ecology or behavior

818
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,559
different uh the

819
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,000
you know role of condition of

820
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
historiosity erodicity

821
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
these are long time debates but now

822
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,240
coming into this new

823
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,799
area where we can at least address them

824
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,880
head-on so let's think about

825
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,399
that perspective and i'm trying to uh

826
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,799
think about how coming from a regular

827
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,120
behavioral sciences perspective

828
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,880
this might play so could this reflect a

829
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,559
fundamental distinction between the free

830
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,440
energy principle

831
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
as an explanatory principle for the

832
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,080
clearly bounded ergodic biological

833
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
systems and the greater complementary

834
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
forces at play that constrain complex

835
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,799
adaptive systems in general

836
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,399
including groups of organisms in their

837
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,640
ecological niche should we restrict the

838
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,360
fep to level the organism and explore

839
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
how the model connects meaningfully to

840
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,559
other key concepts and evolutionary

841
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,080
systems theory about the ancient needs

842
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,039
relation

843
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,000
so that's restating the question whether

844
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,720
the fep

845
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
for some reason would stop applying at

846
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
the level of the organism

847
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,159
and then it would break down at higher

848
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,080
levels

849
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
the aim of this paper is that they're

850
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,240
going to address the challenges

851
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
these comments that people brought up

852
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,399
about the vne

853
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,520
by addressing how it sits within broader

854
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,159
level

855
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,520
questions and so there are

856
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
things that the field of behavioral

857
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,000
sciences

858
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,159
has also been thinking about for example

859
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
you can watch one bird's behavior

860
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,840
it's what you're going to be tracking

861
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,279
but then it's going to be related to

862
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
everyone's behavior so at some point

863
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,480
it's going to be like studying

864
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,640
collective behavior

865
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
so what they're going to do is add the

866
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
variational neuroethology

867
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,080
which is the multi-scale plus the neuro

868
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,440
plus the behavior

869
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,720
plus this niche construction just to

870
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
additively create this variational

871
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,919
ecology

872
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,600
new acronym new paper why not

873
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,279
i thought um by putting together

874
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,559
ensemble dynamics or collective behavior

875
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
eco evo diva and niche construction

876
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,399
complex systems

877
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
free energy principle multi-scale

878
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,520
systems and active inference and

879
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
nestedness and embeddedness

880
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,399
and then kind of just think about how it

881
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
could apply to systems that

882
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,600
persist far from equilibrium within

883
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,480
this flow state valley of things that

884
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,960
are small and fast on the bottom left

885
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,279
to big and broad geospatially

886
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,840
on the top right but we won't go through

887
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,600
the figures in this

888
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,399
talk uh all right

889
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,559
to date vienne has this is before this

890
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,360
paper to date vne has only provided a

891
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
principled method of analyzing nested

892
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
and mutually constraining biological

893
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
systems and their complex adaptive

894
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
dynamics across spatial temporal

895
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
scales it is yet to offer a way to

896
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
individuate systems at scales beyond

897
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
that of the organism acting in its

898
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,559
environment

899
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,640
large-scale ensembles such as societies

900
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
or ecosystems that realize free energy

901
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,760
bounding dynamics

902
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,279
but of course part of the question is do

903
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,200
they and so

904
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
vne was really a theory that was about

905
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
the organism and the

906
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
ecosystem from the perspective and the

907
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,519
focus of the organism's dynamics in the

908
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,279
immediate environment for example

909
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,640
affordances

910
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,039
even if those affordances were subtle or

911
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,279
relied upon this skilled intentionality

912
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,360
or like you know learned behavior

913
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
or sophisticated counterfactuals all

914
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
these things that especially more

915
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,559
recently have been

916
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,600
receiving focus this did not um

917
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
articulate clearly

918
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
or at least had not been specified

919
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,320
specifically

920
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
that it was linked with a collective

921
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,720
behavioral or ecological or cultural

922
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,399
phenomena

923
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,880
which is uh as much a phenotype it's as

924
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,960
much biological as an organism level

925
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,320
trait like arm length or

926
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,640
genome composition there just isn't a

927
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,159
difference between

928
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,440
a bio cultural versus bio

929
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
in this variational framework it's just

930
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,720
different scales different mechanisms

931
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,279
but

932
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,960
it's not even about categorizing

933
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,320
different things it's about how you

934
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,720
model them and what they are um

935
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,840
so the variational neuroethology was a

936
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,039
more clearer

937
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,880
downwards projection about how things

938
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
like behavioral

939
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,000
and hormonal and neural time scales

940
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,519
developmental time scales

941
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,760
were related to organism behavior which

942
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,720
is physiology

943
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,519
neuroethology but the eco evo devo was

944
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,760
less clear

945
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,279
issue was cog gently articulated by

946
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,240
brian berg

947
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,080
and has spent kiramire in their critique

948
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
of variational neurology

949
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,519
they asked also whether the markov

950
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,679
blanket and b formalism leveraged by the

951
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
vne to individuate systems is adequate

952
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,519
for modeling phenomena at the scales

953
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,360
beyond that of a single organism

954
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,679
like socio-cultural dynamics since

955
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
phenomena at these scales may be too

956
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,279
transient or not sufficiently robust to

957
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,679
license the mb markov blanket formalism

958
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,360
which is defined in terms of conditional

959
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
independencies in weekly mixing

960
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,320
random dynamical systems which we'll

961
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,799
also

962
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,840
get back to but bhk

963
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,600
catalyzed this perspective and this is

964
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,039
gonna be broken up into like a few

965
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,679
different

966
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,279
sections markov blankets so

967
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,519
open parenthesis markov blankets are

968
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,120
these statistical using their words

969
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,519
conditional independencies

970
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,919
which is kind of like saying that it's

971
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,559
the opposite of the causal relationships

972
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,720
and so it's equivalent to finding the

973
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
causal relationships through their

974
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
violation of the independence so finding

975
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,879
which variables

976
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,079
are insulatable from each other in um

977
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,320
a sense if you if you think about what

978
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,679
kind of information

979
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
from a generative model you need to

980
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
understand which variables are

981
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
conditionally independent or

982
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,199
just sort of straightforwardly

983
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
correlated that's

984
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
often related to causal state estimation

985
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
about the world

986
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
markov blankets are unable to explain

987
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,879
slash

988
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,760
predict slash control ecosystems and

989
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,359
other collective behavioral

990
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,119
uh collective behaviors quote even

991
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,239
though it's collective behavior all the

992
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,800
way down

993
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,320
at scale because the markov blankets are

994
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,079
not robust enough to try

995
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,719
to capture transient or historical

996
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,040
phenomena

997
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,240
so to go to the paper they they only

998
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,599
work through one example

999
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
in the paper which was how this

1000
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,520
hierarchically mechanistic mind

1001
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,440
evolutionary systems theory can be used

1002
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,680
within that vna framework to study the

1003
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,480
scales of

1004
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,119
human socio biocultural evolution in

1005
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,920
humans

1006
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,359
and there's this table provided with

1007
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,320
some pretty simple slash

1008
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,720
um just one line equations

1009
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
about how different levels of analysis

1010
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,839
would be modeled

1011
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,599
but uh there was a critique which was

1012
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
this downplays a lot of features of

1013
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,640
ecology

1014
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
and the formalisms that apply to

1015
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,680
strongly

1016
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,599
sensorily or strategically bounded

1017
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,440
systems or certain spatial or temporal

1018
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
time scales

1019
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,520
uh is may only be weakly explanatory or

1020
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,320
valid

1021
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,160
at different time skills for a number of

1022
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
reasons which is something that we're

1023
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
going to return to

1024
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,920
when we talk about the ergotic systems

1025
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,240
so here's kind of a theory tree

1026
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,200
the fep is on on the bottom it's sort of

1027
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,320
the uh

1028
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,440
the paradigm level foundation

1029
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
because that's where we're gonna try to

1030
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,800
make things emanate

1031
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,680
from in two but again we could just

1032
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,320
think about

1033
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,599
what would be the effect of switching

1034
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,640
that out too why not

1035
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,920
from left to right we have active

1036
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
inference tin bergen's four questions

1037
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,800
evolutionary systems theory and then eco

1038
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
evo devo

1039
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
so variational neuroethology is like

1040
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
tim bergen's four questions which was

1041
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
what we heard the quote about

1042
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,359
with an evolutionary perspective but a

1043
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,240
simple

1044
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,200
uh at least a sketch of one and then

1045
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
more of an emphasis on active inference

1046
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,359
and on

1047
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,400
smaller scales of analysis the

1048
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,240
variational approach to niche

1049
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,480
construction vanc

1050
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
was also drawing on the evolutionary

1051
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,960
and the pluralist

1052
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,680
tim bergen framework but drew a little

1053
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,920
bit more from the eco evo devo and

1054
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
document for inside like

1055
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,440
just it has that orange one

1056
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,720
and where ve comes into play

1057
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
is with bringing in this synergetics

1058
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
idea

1059
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,480
from the variational approach

1060
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,640
and also the collective behavioral

1061
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
approach and then just

1062
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,320
again making a new acronym kind of

1063
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,599
more specifically combining previous

1064
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
acronyms

1065
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,359
i think it it uh it's worth unpacking

1066
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
it's worth tracing out some of these

1067
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,400
relationships

1068
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
and just seeing what parts get subsumed

1069
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,839
into what

1070
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,119
but ve is just um

1071
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
it's just a more high resolution area

1072
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,040
where mapping can now be performed

1073
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,320
across these different

1074
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
domains so it's kind of like a mapping

1075
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,079
domain

1076
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,680
so here's some of the specific parts

1077
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,119
where they talk about that kind of a

1078
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,040
mapping domain

1079
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,800
in this multiscale framework active

1080
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
inference is inherently a group activity

1081
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
that is the entire ensemble of nested

1082
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
markov blankets are bound

1083
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
enslaved and constrained by dynamics at

1084
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,920
higher scales while the lower

1085
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
microscopic scales furnish the

1086
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
macroscopic

1087
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,560
states at any given level this

1088
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
construction evinces exactly the same

1089
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
circular causality that underlies

1090
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,079
synergetics hakan not fuller

1091
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,720
however here it is generalized to a

1092
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
recursive hierarchy of scales

1093
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
i.e the hierarchical composition of

1094
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
blankets of blankets

1095
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
intuitively the dynamics at one scale

1096
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,079
provide constraints technically they

1097
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,839
establish probability gradients on

1098
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,440
dynamics at other scales

1099
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
active inference destroys free energy

1100
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,640
gradients at each scale

1101
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,720
under the guidance or control of a

1102
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,880
generative model at the scale above

1103
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,560
this guidance is exerted through

1104
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
influences on sensory states where

1105
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,839
circular causality

1106
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,520
means that the action of any markup

1107
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
blanket in an ensemble of markov

1108
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,359
blankets could be involved in sensing

1109
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,760
action or perception depending upon its

1110
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
role at the superordinate scale

1111
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,680
i.e it has a sensory active or internal

1112
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,960
state at the

1113
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,160
level above so there's this kind of base

1114
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
all the way up and down

1115
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,680
uh approach that they're proposing that

1116
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,800
from the level of the organism can go

1117
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
downwards into the cellular the neuro

1118
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,200
and all this level

1119
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
and through time through the

1120
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
evolutionary through the tin bergen

1121
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,760
quadrants

1122
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
and then also outwards through niche

1123
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
construction

1124
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,520
in the multi-skill setting an effective

1125
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,880
state at any scale

1126
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,960
like let's just think of our temperature

1127
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
becomes the expression of an eigenmode

1128
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
of blanket states

1129
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
namely the principal eigenvectors of the

1130
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
jacobian the rate of change of flow with

1131
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
respect to state

1132
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
these mixtures are formerly identical to

1133
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,000
order parameters and synergetics that

1134
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,839
reflect the amplitude of slow or

1135
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,000
unstable stable eigen modes

1136
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
in terms of center manifold theory they

1137
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,760
correspond to solutions on the slow

1138
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
unstable or center of manifold

1139
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
in short the markov blanket of a system

1140
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,359
or particle at any scale

1141
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,280
constitutes an ensemble whose ordered

1142
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,200
parameter sub 10 blanket or internal

1143
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,560
states the scale above

1144
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
so that's like the temperature being

1145
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
above equilibrium with the room

1146
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,560
is because it's part of a sort of closed

1147
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
or semi-closed regulatory system that's

1148
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,400
keeping

1149
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
molecules that are in one part of the

1150
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,240
room constituting my body

1151
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,520
a different temperature than the rest of

1152
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,839
the room

1153
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
note that the constituent microscopic

1154
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,680
states of an ensemble are always blanket

1155
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,319
states

1156
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,680
although their order parameters could be

1157
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,119
blanket states or internal states at the

1158
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,359
microscopic scale above

1159
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,160
so a neuron could be sheathing something

1160
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,839
from a temperature perspective from one

1161
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,839
side but receiving information in a

1162
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,560
different

1163
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,640
uh conceptualization of the blanket

1164
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,480
network this follows from the fact that

1165
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
only

1166
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
the only states that matter are those

1167
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,200
that influence other blanket states

1168
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,640
effectively all we are doing here is

1169
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,079
applying the enslaving principle or

1170
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,760
center manifold theorem recursively to

1171
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,280
mark out blankets and mark on blankets

1172
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,960
imagine you are an employee at an

1173
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,480
institution where you transact your

1174
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,640
microscopic affairs with other personnel

1175
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
to self-evidence your prior belief that

1176
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,520
you are good at your job

1177
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,040
this would entail responding to

1178
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
corporate or institutional goals that

1179
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,400
emerge collectively i.e an implicit

1180
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,920
generative model at the macroscopic

1181
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,040
level

1182
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,800
note that your job may be homologous to

1183
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,480
an internal state at the institutional

1184
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,560
macroscopic level relating only to other

1185
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,640
employees alternatively you could be

1186
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
working on reception

1187
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,240
i.e a sensory state or issuing press

1188
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,520
releases ie in active state

1189
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,920
and this is actually an image from a

1190
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,119
paper that

1191
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,839
team com wrote on 99 2020

1192
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,560
and one of the figures and it was about

1193
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,520
how

1194
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,800
remote teams and a lot of other kinds of

1195
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
groups that might not be traditionally

1196
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
considered remote teams can be

1197
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,200
explicitly mapped and from systems

1198
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
engineering perspective modeled

1199
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,400
as this nested markov blanket framework

1200
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,319
and so you have for example the team

1201
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,920
members who have their own digital

1202
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,680
interfaces their own sensory and active

1203
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
states digitally

1204
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
some of these team members can be

1205
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,119
augmented or can be bots themselves

1206
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
and they're interacting with certain

1207
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
databases and then they're able to also

1208
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:11,760
undertake

1209
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,599
team operations this is where the

1210
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,880
variational approach to niche

1211
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,720
construction

1212
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,599
comes in the anc exploits the expression

1213
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
of expected free energy as expected cost

1214
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
plus ambiguity to propose that agents

1215
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,800
upload as it were

1216
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,400
much of the leg work in computing

1217
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
expected free energy to their

1218
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,839
self-tailored constructed environment

1219
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
more precisely it argues that niche

1220
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
construction can be cast

1221
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,640
as the collective activity by which

1222
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,480
organisms act on their material

1223
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,359
environment

1224
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,520
to create unambiguous structure which

1225
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,960
can then be leveraged via active

1226
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,520
inference

1227
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,119
like creating books and then people can

1228
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,720
scan their eyes over

1229
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,560
lasting changes to the niche capture the

1230
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,480
fact that environmental cues function as

1231
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,079
an unambiguous indicator of the

1232
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,240
affordance of action possibilities

1233
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
like if you're culturally sensitized to

1234
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,520
know what a book looks like

1235
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,960
you know what it's for you know that if

1236
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,480
you scan through the first three pages

1237
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,520
with your eyes

1238
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,760
and it's culturally specific whether the

1239
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,200
first pages are going to be on this side

1240
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
of the book or on this side of the book

1241
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,880
or

1242
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,319
whether the text will read this way or

1243
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,240
this way

1244
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,880
this structure can be cast in terms of

1245
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,720
epistemic resources that flag the

1246
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
actions that resolve the ambiguity

1247
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,560
associated with future observations

1248
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,839
while conforming to the prior

1249
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,599
preferences of the organism entailed by

1250
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,800
its generative model

1251
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,560
so you're in the library you're doing

1252
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,079
some optimal foraging

1253
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,800
for a book about a certain topic and you

1254
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,720
expect that there's a certain structural

1255
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,480
organization to the books

1256
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
and that if you find something where

1257
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,280
it's written on the back of the book

1258
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,800
that you think it's the book it is

1259
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,319
you expect that the title page is going

1260
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,079
to conform with that so these are like

1261
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,599
epistemic resources that are more

1262
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,160
visible

1263
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,319
more scannable that's what allows that

1264
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,359
information to be

1265
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,520
found and therefore leveraged so that's

1266
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
niche construction

1267
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,720
in terms of direct epistemic resources

1268
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,480
but you can also think about

1269
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,280
in cases like social insects where their

1270
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,400
extended

1271
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,520
niche their nest is something that they

1272
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,800
pass on potentially even

1273
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
intergenerationally and that the

1274
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,000
structure and the form of the function

1275
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,480
are all

1276
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,000
linked to their collective behavioral

1277
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,839
algorithms with the architecture

1278
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,480
influencing their behavioral

1279
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
proclivities

1280
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,520
and there's some interesting work by

1281
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,119
professor pincer wolman

1282
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,400
on that in the heart of strands

1283
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,680
then that physical structure becomes a

1284
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,599
epistemic resource as well in that it

1285
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,560
becomes part of their extended cognition

1286
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,839
all right so

1287
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
for this last section of section

1288
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,319
07 of the live stream my friend sean

1289
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,680
had a great question and so for this

1290
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,359
last section it will be a little bit

1291
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,079
about

1292
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,000
ergotic systems and as with

1293
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,839
you know all other areas of this sort of

1294
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,079
discussion

1295
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,160
it's uh it's a playful and it's a

1296
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,319
partial recap of the ideas so

1297
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,040
if someone knows more i would love to go

1298
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,319
deeper into some of these

1299
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,400
ideas i just kind of laid it out in a

1300
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
way that hopefully

1301
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,680
might relate to uh an informative way to

1302
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,000
onboard onto thinking about things from

1303
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
an active inference perspective

1304
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,520
and there's definitely perspectives on

1305
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,040
youtube and elsewhere that are a lot

1306
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,720
more rigorous and comprehensive than

1307
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
what i'm about to go through

1308
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,839
but this is just gonna be a couple of

1309
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,280
minutes on

1310
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,680
linking ecology which is what we're

1311
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,880
trying to explain

1312
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,960
we're not just trying to make theory

1313
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,720
after theory we really want to return

1314
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
to the ecology and make variational

1315
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,040
ecology a theory about ecology

1316
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,880
that allows us to do the things that we

1317
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,280
want to do in ecology whether that's

1318
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,480
conservation or just understanding

1319
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
so many other things that ecology can

1320
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,160
teach us but we're also

1321
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,359
going to talk about erodicity about cog

1322
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,200
ergo sum and of course active inference

1323
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,880
all right so what sean asked

1324
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,760
was are thinking beings or their

1325
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,720
environments

1326
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,440
weakly mixing ergotic systems if not do

1327
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,079
they fulfill

1328
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,599
some of the assumptions or axioms of the

1329
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,240
mathematics underlying the fep

1330
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,720
so this was kind of a great question by

1331
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,960
sean because

1332
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200
it really came at a perfect time when i

1333
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,000
was preparing

1334
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,680
these slides and if we go back to the

1335
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,520
critique slide where the very own

1336
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,119
variational neurology was being

1337
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,000
presented

1338
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,599
remember it was that there was the

1339
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,200
critique of the vne

1340
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,280
that got us to the v the response to

1341
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,119
that that got us to the ve

1342
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,480
as far as connecting the organism down

1343
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,839
with the vne with the organism up with a

1344
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,280
niche construction just connecting the

1345
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,040
two points into a line

1346
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,480
and calling that variation oncology and

1347
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,119
the the the critique was that there was

1348
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,640
going to be some violation

1349
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,119
of some of the lower level sensory um

1350
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,760
coherentness of say an organism

1351
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
and that because of that it wouldn't

1352
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,319
that the same formalisms wouldn't apply

1353
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,800
and so this is someone coming from a

1354
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,359
more like thermo statistics

1355
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,880
um background and seeing a very similar

1356
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,800
phrasing a different way and just asking

1357
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,440
a really interesting related question

1358
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,079
and as he put it the argument of the

1359
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,920
free energy principle is two parts

1360
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,839
the first calls on the lawful dynamics

1361
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,359
of any weakly mixing

1362
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,760
aka organic system that persists in a

1363
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,800
changing environment

1364
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,839
from a single cell organism to a human

1365
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,599
brain these lawful dynamics suggest that

1366
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,200
internal states can be interpreted as

1367
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,119
modeling or predicting external causes

1368
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,040
of sensory perturbations

1369
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,359
aka embodying and acting a generative

1370
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,800
model of adaptive policies and

1371
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,559
phenotypes in other words

1372
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,119
if a system exists its internal states

1373
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,880
encode probabilistic beliefs about

1374
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,920
external states

1375
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,680
and so when i read that you know i

1376
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,960
didn't know it's like is he

1377
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,319
is he summing that up as like the

1378
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,559
insight as like the final

1379
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,240
distillation of something that he finds

1380
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
deeply true or is he bringing this up as

1381
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
sort of a well that's a tautology that's

1382
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,280
a circular

1383
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
logic or that's an argument that holds

1384
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,559
nowhere

1385
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,680
so i i didn't know but uh it turns out

1386
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,480
that

1387
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,200
there is a paper from 2015 called i am

1388
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,319
therefore i think

1389
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,680
so um this last little part is going to

1390
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,520
be about that paper

1391
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,839
which i hope will be interesting whether

1392
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,559
you're familiar with these ideas or not

1393
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,400
but also with some of the uh

1394
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,119
mathematics behind the ergodicity and

1395
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,720
about why there's still

1396
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,520
significant reason to understand how

1397
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,599
ergotic systems non-ergotic systems are

1398
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,520
related to the fep

1399
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,040
so i am therefore i think is uh kind of

1400
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
related to this i think therefore i am

1401
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,319
calgary or some but

1402
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,559
of course it's just a meme so here's a

1403
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,000
few other versions

1404
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,359
i think therefore i am not here or

1405
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,760
a comic where it says i think therefore

1406
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,200
i am and then the other person says i

1407
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,839
don't therefore i am not

1408
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,079
and uh also the cog cogito ergosome

1409
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,480
i think therefore i am i think therefore

1410
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
i overthink either i think therefore i

1411
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,599
regret i think therefore someday i won't

1412
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,760
so all these different implications what

1413
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,800
what you know what are the real

1414
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,079
implications what logic

1415
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,960
can we can we make claims about well

1416
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,040
that's not exactly what this is about

1417
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
this is going to be about two kinds of

1418
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,079
systems

1419
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,520
which are ergotic systems or not or

1420
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,960
or ergotic systems and this isn't

1421
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,559
something that's um a hyper abstract but

1422
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,440
it definitely

1423
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,240
does recall a lot of generalizable

1424
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,839
principles and math

1425
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,480
so to make it very specific and

1426
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,680
empirical

1427
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,280
we're going to discuss it in terms of

1428
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,359
the ergodic hypothesis

1429
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,680
so it's a specific hypothesis that we're

1430
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,480
talking about

1431
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,440
that means it's something we're going to

1432
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,839
test with data and the hypothesis

1433
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,960
is we hypothesize that mixing through

1434
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,599
space

1435
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,000
is like mixing through time and let's

1436
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,680
talk a little bit more about that

1437
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,520
because it's kind of a

1438
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,960
wild and interesting idea so the first

1439
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,480
thing to know is that it's a

1440
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,359
hypothesis this ergotic hypothesis it's

1441
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,240
not the ergotic

1442
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,359
law or the ergotic pattern or uh

1443
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,599
anything like that it's hypothesis

1444
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,880
that's uh

1445
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,359
can be uh tested using data and

1446
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,640
statistical models

1447
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,040
that are transparent and reproducible

1448
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,760
and just

1449
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,000
open to understanding how changes in

1450
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,680
their parameters influence the

1451
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,760
kind of conclusions that are reached so

1452
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,960
that's something

1453
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,040
about what we're discussing here with

1454
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,119
the ergotic systems

1455
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,200
also the ergotic hypothesis depends on

1456
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,720
the spatial and temporal scale

1457
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,160
and then also the measurement or the

1458
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,000
analysis space and

1459
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,599
potentially this comes into play a lot

1460
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,000
more when you're really getting down

1461
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,280
into the weeds of the

1462
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,839
math or the application but often the

1463
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,359
way that you measure something

1464
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,359
or which sections of the time series you

1465
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,200
allow for burn in for example

1466
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,680
or mixing these things are all really

1467
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,640
critical and what

1468
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,119
what scale whether you're looking at a

1469
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,480
tiny tiny tiny

1470
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,160
cube and seeing if there's random

1471
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
association between chemical particles

1472
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
for example versus looking at a

1473
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,359
one meter cubed uh blocking of the world

1474
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,800
so the coarse graining matters a lot now

1475
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,599
ecology and history are often strongly

1476
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,440
critical of applications of

1477
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,240
ergotic methods or that methods that

1478
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,040
often

1479
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,839
uh are used to model ergotic systems so

1480
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:20,640
first let's

1481
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,400
talk about the ergotic hypothesis and

1482
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,760
what it actually says

1483
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,839
and does and then talk about some

1484
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,480
ecological critique of it

1485
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
and then see how the cog ego sum comes

1486
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,680
into play

1487
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,640
all right so the ergotic hypothesis is

1488
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,520
defined

1489
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,359
by the time average being

1490
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,800
equal to the space average so

1491
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,359
that is uh again this sort of mixing

1492
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,800
through space is like mixing through

1493
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,200
time

1494
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,760
idea and one way to think about it is

1495
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,640
like

1496
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,839
if you have a box with a gas in it

1497
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,040
and you're going to trace one molecule

1498
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,079
and take snapshots of it at 100 times

1499
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,599
would its trajectory in some statistical

1500
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,480
way

1501
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
be similar to if you just selected 100

1502
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,040
particles in the box at the same time

1503
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,000
or if you let loose one molecule bounce

1504
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,800
a hundred

1505
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,119
times by itself all these different ways

1506
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,319
of asking it

1507
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,240
but it kind of relates like is it

1508
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,599
basically fair

1509
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,680
to sample you know one roulette table

1510
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,359
through time or a hundred roulette

1511
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,800
tables at the same time

1512
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,960
every roulette spin is like the same so

1513
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,920
in in

1514
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,040
it's very different than um uh something

1515
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,520
where

1516
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,040
the uh strategies evolve through time

1517
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,920
for example you might already even be

1518
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,599
seeing

1519
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,440
and one more slide of just the

1520
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,559
definition is that there's this

1521
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,480
generation of an ensemble so that's sort

1522
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:48,720
of

1523
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,760
already for saging this ensemble

1524
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,079
group selection dynamic versus the time

1525
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,520
element and this paper was very

1526
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,319
interesting

1527
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,720
that i found while preparing for this

1528
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,160
stream and i'll just go through it

1529
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,760
because i think it's also a really

1530
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,640
cool story about a philosophy of science

1531
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,760
and about

1532
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,000
how the way that we think about

1533
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,839
different hypotheses and axioms and

1534
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,720
principles

1535
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,000
really influences the kind of science

1536
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
that we do so it's called from the

1537
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,920
ergotic hypothesis and physics to the

1538
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,559
ergotic

1539
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,680
axiom in economics by kirsten

1540
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,200
2015. so

1541
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,680
the the work is summarized as this

1542
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,280
contribution seeks to clarify the

1543
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,480
specific relation between the idea of

1544
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,440
non-ergodicity which is drawn from

1545
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,520
statistical mechanics and its role

1546
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,079
in and for economics and finance the

1547
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,760
identified change of status is how the

1548
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,000
ergotic hypothesis in physics became the

1549
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
ergotic axiom in economics

1550
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,599
therefore we follow the idea from

1551
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,760
rational mechanics of gibbs

1552
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,000
via wilson to samuelson and eventually

1553
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,400
from the latter into rational economics

1554
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,000
the methodological spillover from the

1555
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,680
natural sciences to economics and the

1556
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,760
assumption of ergodicity in particular

1557
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,079
enabled and shaped the mathematicization

1558
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,040
of economics

1559
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,400
seen since the 1940s so it shapes the

1560
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,599
fields direction

1561
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,920
depending on how people use methods from

1562
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,559
ergotic uh

1563
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,920
assumptions or not and this was a nice

1564
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,800
diagram where

1565
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,720
boltzmann and poincarey and gibbs

1566
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,800
and how it transduces through different

1567
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,480
generations and it's kind of like a

1568
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,720
kind of like a citation network here

1569
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,599
and i think a great example which was

1570
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,799
used in the paper

1571
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,040
is this st petersburg paradox and this

1572
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,160
is a really fun

1573
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,160
kind of game theory and thought

1574
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,480
experiment complexity

1575
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,280
uh classic that's related to economics

1576
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,440
so i'll just read it as it is from the

1577
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,520
paper in seventh it's called the saint

1578
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,640
petersburg paradox

1579
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,160
in 1713 swift mathematician nicolas a

1580
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,040
bernoulli

1581
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,720
posed in an exchange of letters with a

1582
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,480
french mathematician pierre remote de

1583
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,119
montmore

1584
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,280
the following problem what does a

1585
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,640
reasonable price

1586
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,480
p for a ticket for the following lottery

1587
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,920
so on the first flip it's gonna be a

1588
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,400
fair

1589
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,640
coin and uh if you win

1590
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,480
you can either take one dollar and then

1591
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,720
uh game's over or you can play again

1592
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,760
and then on uh

1593
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,319
the second flip if you keep playing so

1594
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,440
there's

1595
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,720
there's multiple versions in this

1596
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,799
version in here

1597
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,960
it either gives you a dollar or you keep

1598
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,720
playing and so you get a payoff at each

1599
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,920
time

1600
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,040
um if uh another version is where you

1601
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,559
can decide to keep playing

1602
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,000
and then you can imagine that getting a

1603
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,559
50

1604
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,640
chance of that first one is kind of like

1605
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,480
now the games are very similar

1606
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,839
because you can either um either by

1607
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,200
by force or buy not so in either case

1608
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,960
you can ask yourself how much would you

1609
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,200
pay to play either of those two little

1610
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,119
variants of the game

1611
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,359
and um it turns out that people don't

1612
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,599
want to pay infinite money to buy in

1613
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,040
so especially the one where you either

1614
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,280
continue or get the payout

1615
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,720
the expected value of of all the

1616
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,319
ensemble of trajectories one in a

1617
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,839
million is going to make you know two to

1618
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:20,880
the n

1619
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,520
money and so one in a million is going

1620
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,119
to make so much money

1621
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,119
uh it's the expected value across the

1622
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,880
ensemble with the geometric mean

1623
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,400
or the arithmetic mean would be like

1624
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,640
very high but it still wouldn't be worth

1625
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,520
that much

1626
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,160
why so let's go into that why does that

1627
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,920
st petersburg petersburg

1628
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,599
paradox uh challenge ergodicity

1629
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,640
one answer is it's about pragmatics

1630
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,359
your life is not ergotic you're not well

1631
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,559
mixing across

1632
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,599
um you know different places to eat

1633
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,440
across different places to sleep

1634
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,920
there's a regularity to your life and so

1635
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,559
especially

1636
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,240
considering it in the sort of niche

1637
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,720
construction for your own

1638
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,359
uncertainty reduction slash precision

1639
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,119
maximization

1640
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,839
even putting that all aside it's just

1641
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,480
your own

1642
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,480
singular trajectory from a strategic

1643
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,520
perspective

1644
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,559
doesn't resemble the assumptions

1645
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,280
that are under the

1646
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,400
distribution-conforming norms of

1647
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
well-mixed and gas molecules that's for

1648
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,680
sure

1649
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,359
and another way to say that is that the

1650
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,280
realized risk profile through time

1651
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,680
is not the same as through space so if

1652
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,040
you're playing that game you know who

1653
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,319
wants to be a millionaire and it's going

1654
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,119
up okay

1655
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,319
i've got 12 coin flips in a row i'm at a

1656
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,400
thousand dollars or something like that

1657
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,000
i could take two thousand dollars or i

1658
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,799
can go home with nothing

1659
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,960
at some point it's just not going to

1660
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,839
make sense

1661
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,240
to go double or nothing on some insane

1662
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,559
value because there's this realized

1663
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,079
trade-off between risk so that's not

1664
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,559
and that's part of this historiosity and

1665
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,079
non-eradicity of your own trajectory

1666
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,720
ecosystems may not be ergotic so that

1667
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,680
would be like

1668
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,000
because of secession dynamics or

1669
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,040
non-linear

1670
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,920
perturbations or resilience properties

1671
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,960
ecosystems

1672
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,640
may or may not have this sort of

1673
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,720
roulette wheel property

1674
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,319
or other nice

1675
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,240
aspects of uh high or low dimensional

1676
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,520
systems that physics

1677
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
prefers so there's interesting

1678
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,280
theoretical work oh well imagine if

1679
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,799
every patch the ecosystem was like a

1680
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,240
spin glass that would be a phase

1681
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,040
transition

1682
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,640
but in the real world it's always a

1683
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,119
little bit messier than that

1684
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,040
so then just take that sort of st

1685
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,200
petersburg paradox and then

1686
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
literally the money one now adding niche

1687
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,880
construction and so i was just thinking

1688
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,200
well

1689
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,680
yeah what if what if every city in the

1690
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,839
country gets to play this paradox

1691
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,160
and then one city or you know one

1692
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,119
individual

1693
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,119
wins just a ridiculous amount and a few

1694
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,319
people with a small amount

1695
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,240
most people with nothing and then that

1696
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,319
city does infrastructure investment

1697
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,400
so how does that change the way that

1698
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,079
future people would be able to

1699
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,760
for example play the paradox later

1700
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,240
so that's niche construction so now

1701
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,599
think about the historicity and the

1702
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,200
niche construction whether that's social

1703
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,480
insects or humans

1704
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
and you can see how some of these

1705
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,839
ergodic assumptions

1706
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,880
as they apply to cultural

1707
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,000
behavioral systems may be like

1708
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
a little bit tenuous or metaphorical at

1709
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,119
best

1710
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,040
here's a few nice figures from this

1711
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
paper though too

1712
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,400
so on the bottom right there's this

1713
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,960
ergotic case and so one of the features

1714
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,680
of ergodicity is this time reversal

1715
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,839
like the molecule bouncing around the

1716
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:38,960
room it's kind of this

1717
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,440
general time reversible family of models

1718
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,359
that allows extremely

1719
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,400
um interesting bi-directional

1720
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,160
computation in a way that historical

1721
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,599
systems don't

1722
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,240
and so timelessness exists in a current

1723
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,359
t equals zero

1724
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,559
that's the present moment and then

1725
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,720
there's like this uh analytical time

1726
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,119
like reaction coordinate for a chemical

1727
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,280
reaction when the two molecules come

1728
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,160
together

1729
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,000
it's not graphed in terms of time but

1730
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,760
reactions do have time distributions

1731
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,880
that they occur on

1732
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,040
but the way that that is represented is

1733
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,640
on actually a free energy landscape

1734
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,920
gibbs free energy

1735
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,400
with um a reaction coordinate because

1736
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,839
that's like this ergotic

1737
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,920
hypothesis about the way that these

1738
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,319
reactions are reversible through time

1739
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,720
in contrast there's the non-ergotic case

1740
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,520
on the top

1741
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,680
and in the top there's a symmetry break

1742
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,040
in the present moment

1743
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,720
so that means that there's events in the

1744
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,400
present moment that change the

1745
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,839
distribution going forward

1746
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,000
in a way that doesn't make time

1747
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,160
reversibility a tenable proposition

1748
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,760
and that's because they happen in

1749
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,200
historical time

1750
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,799
so that's kind of a cool idea and then

1751
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,640
there was yet another great figure from

1752
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,920
this paper

1753
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,520
where with kind of a lot going on but i

1754
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,720
think it's worth looking at because it

1755
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,839
was so cool

1756
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,359
so first there's the not analyzed not

1757
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,119
analyzed is just before your data window

1758
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,480
is available

1759
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,400
then there's this realm where you use

1760
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,319
the ergodic methods ergodicity it's

1761
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,160
almost like the name of a city

1762
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,240
and what you see in this window is the

1763
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,000
spurious quote calls a relationship in

1764
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,520
your observation window so let's just

1765
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,559
say like you know between

1766
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,280
bitcoin and and exports of some other

1767
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,880
resource or something

1768
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,200
and even if you everyone knows

1769
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,040
correlation isn't causation but then

1770
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,799
there's methods like dynamic causal

1771
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:17,520
modeling

1772
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,920
ranger causality and machine learning

1773
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,880
methods that

1774
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,559
try to quote learn so there's so much uh

1775
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,319
in the way that people use methods

1776
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,160
whether or not they think they're

1777
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,760
they at the very least will say they're

1778
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,599
using data from the past to reduce their

1779
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,119
uncertainty about the future

1780
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,079
which is what led to financial collapse

1781
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,440
it's what uh

1782
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,599
it's what leads to a lot of strategic

1783
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,720
strengths and weaknesses

1784
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,440
in a lot of different areas so that's

1785
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,640
the ergotic

1786
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,680
fallacy valley now

1787
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,160
the non-causal window is like let's just

1788
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,960
say where

1789
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,359
there's a different window of time

1790
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:54,319
whether it's

1791
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,799
window two or window four and under

1792
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,559
either of those time intervals under

1793
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,520
consideration

1794
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,119
the same factors that were at play and

1795
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,799
one may not matter that much like if you

1796
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,839
observe the first

1797
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,960
post forest fire three weeks the rules

1798
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,880
that dictate that regime

1799
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,160
let's just say the spurious causal

1800
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,839
relationship oh nitrogen is a limiting

1801
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:12,880
factor or

1802
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,960
oh insects don't play a major role in

1803
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,079
this process

1804
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,559
that may or may not be true in a future

1805
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,160
time window that's not overlapping

1806
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,559
or partially overlapping seems pretty

1807
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,400
fair pretty valid i think it's a great

1808
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,599
figure and then also there's like second

1809
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,160
and future symmetry breakings as well so

1810
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,200
even if you go well

1811
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,880
there was a major systems change and the

1812
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,039
present moment or

1813
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,799
at x time but uh

1814
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,319
things are still the same in this regard

1815
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,079
this invariant still holds or this

1816
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,039
measure is still

1817
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,799
valid but then they they can't

1818
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,280
guarantee that there's going to be this

1819
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,559
uh invariance in a future arbitrary

1820
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,480
symmetry break so what are the

1821
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,920
frameworks that will carry us through

1822
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,760
these symmetry breaks

1823
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,640
and not just have very weak underbellies

1824
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,599
with respect

1825
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,000
to things that we don't even perceive on

1826
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,839
the horizon

1827
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,520
so let's return to debra's

1828
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,799
paper about fusion of behavioral ecology

1829
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:16,559
and ecology and um

1830
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,160
talk about whether simulations

1831
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,480
variability historiosity and

1832
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,520
other sort of not quantitative questions

1833
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,799
but qualitative ideas

1834
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,720
it challenged this ergotic hypothesis so

1835
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,000
she wrote in behavioral behavior in the

1836
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
illusion of erodicity and ecology

1837
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,559
it's a section this paper ecology often

1838
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,640
represents ecological processes in terms

1839
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,240
of the functional relation among

1840
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
average values for example to ask

1841
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,520
whether an invasion will be more

1842
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,000
successful

1843
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,119
when there are many species in the

1844
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,960
community to ask how an average

1845
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,640
propaganda will fare when the average

1846
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,559
population size of many local species

1847
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:51,599
are high

1848
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,440
methods for evaluating ecological

1849
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,440
outcomes often assume ergodicity

1850
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,520
that all samples are homogeneous and

1851
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,200
that populations being sampled are

1852
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,000
invariant

1853
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
this can be misleading behavior is a

1854
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,280
response to conditions

1855
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,119
but individuals vary in response and

1856
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,400
conditions change

1857
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,240
the result is that ecological processes

1858
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,440
are not ergotic

1859
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,280
samples are not homogeneous and

1860
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,599
processes can change over time

1861
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,119
very nice in a well titled section

1862
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,200
and to kind of add on to this

1863
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,559
perspective and

1864
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,160
return to this question about

1865
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,799
non-ergodicity in historical processes

1866
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,240
like ecology

1867
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,440
here's a paper in 2016

1868
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,280
replaying life's tape simulation

1869
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,280
metaphors and historiosity in steven j

1870
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,319
gould's view life

1871
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,520
so not a endorsement or critique of

1872
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,280
steven j gould it's to bring it up as a

1873
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,359
philosophy of science point just as any

1874
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:41,920
other

1875
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,559
paper i would address so this is from

1876
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,240
the paper and it is a 1974

1877
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,440
paper of ralph and gould and what they

1878
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,559
did is they

1879
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,079
did simulations with where branches

1880
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,119
uh node branching rates were a parameter

1881
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,119
and then also there was like mutational

1882
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,960
changes and they're like wow the

1883
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,760
extinction

1884
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,119
distribution looks like

1885
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,680
we see in the fossil record and the

1886
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,039
morpho distribution

1887
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,119
looks like we see in the fossil record

1888
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,400
maybe

1889
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,640
selection doesn't matter or maybe it's

1890
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,319
just random stuff

1891
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,960
and to kind of build on that in another

1892
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,319
figure in the paper

1893
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,799
this is two outcomes of the simulation

1894
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,079
that they later ran so

1895
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,760
this is probably a later paper from from

1896
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,920
them or from from colleagues

1897
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,720
that use again kind of like a birth

1898
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,119
death

1899
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,280
process so like the lateral line is a

1900
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,039
birth of like a new clade

1901
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,440
speciation event with a uh

1902
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,039
of some type maybe with niche

1903
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,880
displacement maybe not

1904
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,640
and then there's also the population

1905
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,240
size growing or shrinking by a small

1906
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,520
amount but when it reaches

1907
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,319
zero it kind of goes extinct and so they

1908
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:54,720
were

1909
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,039
seeing wow we're seeing big variation

1910
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,799
between quote clades or

1911
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,720
different levels of organization in

1912
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,039
terms of their biodiversity or in terms

1913
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,240
of their species number

1914
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,880
or their morphological diversity so

1915
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,799
again maybe it's just the random

1916
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:09,520
punctuated

1917
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,960
equilibrium events that end up driving

1918
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,920
the ship

1919
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,440
now this comes down uh and you can come

1920
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,799
down on the stephen j gould's side or

1921
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,599
not

1922
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,799
on this question whether the

1923
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:23,520
historiosity

1924
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,599
of the past the uniqueness of the

1925
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,960
trajectory or the

1926
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,240
the uh uh i guess the timeline that we

1927
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,760
appear to be in whatever your feelings

1928
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,240
on

1929
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,480
the his on the historiosity of that the

1930
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,599
question is really from an

1931
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:38,960
instrumentalist point of view from a

1932
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,160
functional point of view

1933
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,799
can you use these methods that may have

1934
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,720
statistical assumptions

1935
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,440
underlying them that assume ergotic

1936
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,240
processes

1937
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,559
so for example when you do a t-test it's

1938
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,559
like making the assumption that

1939
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,559
with respect to other variables all else

1940
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,000
is equal but

1941
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,760
and everyone says oh well of course if

1942
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,280
you if you sample

1943
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,839
group a and country one group b and

1944
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:02,559
country two

1945
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,200
it's conflated but the t-test doesn't

1946
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,319
know that

1947
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,319
and so where we don't know that the

1948
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,760
t-test doesn't know that

1949
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,640
and more complicated machine learning

1950
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,000
methods

1951
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,319
are only able to do this in a really

1952
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,599
more nuanced way

1953
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,119
in certain situations especially with

1954
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,520
large data sets so

1955
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,720
for the stephen j gould camp it was the

1956
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,480
incidental long-term deep time events

1957
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,599
black swan events that drove the ship

1958
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,599
whereas another way to think about it in

1959
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,839
the one that i personally would probably

1960
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,799
end up emphasizing at the end of the day

1961
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,480
is that it's actually selection on the

1962
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,400
morphology locally over that deep

1963
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,920
ecological time

1964
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,920
there's also the day-to-day of those

1965
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,440
little trilobite creatures

1966
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,359
having to live in their niche and so

1967
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,039
selection is continually on their

1968
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,720
morphology and behavior

1969
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,200
and then yes events happen over longer

1970
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,400
time periods and the whole question

1971
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,920
about multi-scale biology is how to

1972
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,280
integrate those two

1973
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,880
rather than saying well oh well clade

1974
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,720
formation is random versus oh it's

1975
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,000
really strongly driven by niche

1976
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,200
partitioning

1977
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,680
so to kind of actually close this with a

1978
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,240
with a

1979
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,160
cogeto ergo sum uh part

1980
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
here's some figures for me i think or i

1981
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,599
am therefore i think paper

1982
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,520
with fristen and mathias so

1983
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,279
this left side is i am ergotic

1984
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,880
therefore i think let's just you know

1985
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,479
see what the authors say

1986
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,279
because with all these uh critiques from

1987
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,080
ecology

1988
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,560
and from cultural biologists on

1989
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,679
ergodicity

1990
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,080
and on the brain the mind and everything

1991
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,198
so here is

1992
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,520
sort of a two-stroke engine and it goes

1993
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,719
from rez

1994
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,080
extensa which is sort of the the the

1995
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
behavioral action policy selection

1996
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,679
flowing out

1997
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,839
and then the res cockpit is like the

1998
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,520
belief partition of the brain

1999
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,040
so the belief could be i believe that

2000
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,238
the training is going to come in five

2001
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,198
minutes

2002
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,279
and that would be like corresponding to

2003
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,719
a detachable thought or

2004
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,479
debate whether it's a representation or

2005
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,799
whether it's a metaphysic uh component

2006
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,960
and then this is just one partitioning

2007
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,920
they're thrown out there we'll see

2008
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,279
another one in a second

2009
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,439
and then this free energy functional is

2010
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,439
being used to select the maximum

2011
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,319
likelihood policy and so that's why it's

2012
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:16,799
doing

2013
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:20,238
um this pursuit of the

2014
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,479
minimally surprising across the

2015
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,238
variational scales of analysis of

2016
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:25,040
surprise

2017
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,880
is trying to select the control policy

2018
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,319
that's going to bring

2019
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,399
sensory observations into alignment with

2020
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,799
a deep generative model

2021
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,040
so the belief i am ergotic could lead to

2022
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,719
behavior that at least pursues

2023
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:37,520
ergodicity

2024
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,799
is that enough and then

2025
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,319
uh they kind of build it out one another

2026
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,158
level which is i think i am ergotic

2027
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,359
therefore i am so that kind of is

2028
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,800
an inversion of i am therefore i think

2029
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,640
i don't know how you get from here to

2030
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,159
there maybe there's other figures to

2031
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,320
make or other arrows to draw but it is

2032
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,880
interesting to think about how basically

2033
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,239
it's a little bit unpacking the

2034
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:10,239
um uh res cognitives beliefs

2035
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,560
from a bayesian perspective into the

2036
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,000
posterior belief

2037
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,840
and then the likelihood and prior belief

2038
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,120
so that's like the

2039
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,400
um now there's like a bayesian

2040
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,239
two-stroke engine up there

2041
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,840
and then out of the free energy

2042
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,440
functional reflecting the likelihood and

2043
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,080
bayesian

2044
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,199
beliefs is also um

2045
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,000
the policy that sort of relates to our

2046
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,440
discussions on the

2047
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,480
uh generative model being a policy model

2048
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,520
all right here's kind of a funny figure

2049
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,840
with uh focusing on the ear of this

2050
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,120
statue

2051
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,560
and just uh

2052
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,400
uh it has equations on

2053
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,520
the ocular motor being linked through

2054
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,520
the action so action causes the ocular

2055
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,040
motor to move

2056
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,520
and the eye sends back visual sensations

2057
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,800
and proprioception

2058
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,760
so that's sq and sp and it's like that's

2059
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,239
the interface for the eye that's the api

2060
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,640
for the eye that's what we have access

2061
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,280
to

2062
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,800
and that's what we can model and it's

2063
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,400
that dual instrumentalism the

2064
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,120
one layer is like yeah these are the

2065
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,960
areas of signal that the eye gets and

2066
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,679
receives

2067
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,440
so from an engineering perspective the

2068
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,199
scientists instrumentalism is like yeah

2069
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,480
it's good enough for us just to model

2070
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,760
the system that way

2071
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,280
because there's basically nothing that

2072
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,520
goes outside of that flow state even

2073
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,840
though each one is complicated

2074
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,520
but then the second one would be this is

2075
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,960
actually how the eye works and it turns

2076
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,960
out that some of these hypotheses

2077
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,719
about how the actual streams of

2078
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,560
information or communication should be

2079
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,440
in the brain

2080
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,440
that they are concurrent with some of

2081
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,360
these inference schemes

2082
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,360
which is interesting and this figure

2083
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,080
was about how like looking at the same

2084
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,280
statue

2085
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,040
there's the stimulus which is the actual

2086
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,640
image itself

2087
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,800
and what the visual input is is that is

2088
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
the retinal cells which are activated

2089
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,239
let's say by

2090
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:01,760
edges and then the salience could be in

2091
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,640
terms of a

2092
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,000
deep generative model as far as what

2093
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,199
area of the sample would be or what area

2094
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:09,760
of the

2095
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,840
visual field would be most optimal to

2096
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,960
sample ergo

2097
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,880
which action policy would be optimal to

2098
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,800
undertake and we see this

2099
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,000
sampling which is a um

2100
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,600
a little bit outlining the face if you

2101
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,000
kind of look at it overlay it

2102
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,719
because these are the optimal places to

2103
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:27,280
forage

2104
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,280
so to speak for information to resolve

2105
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,480
what it is

2106
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,640
so um i'm just going to go through this

2107
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,440
last

2108
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,280
figure from i am therefore i think

2109
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,560
because i think it's kind of interesting

2110
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:38,960
and

2111
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,320
funny so here's how we can walk through

2112
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,000
this

2113
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,080
a behavioral sequence is embodied so

2114
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,920
that's the ocular motor

2115
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,440
red dots moving around it's like

2116
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,560
so the behavioral sequence is embodied

2117
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,719
or enacted and also encultured and

2118
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:57,920
embedded that's the whole

2119
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,159
variational approach so right now we're

2120
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,760
focused on the ocular motor

2121
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,800
dimension to really unpack it but

2122
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,719
it's something that we could have moving

2123
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,719
up like in one culture

2124
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,199
they learned that avoiding eye contact

2125
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:11,840
is

2126
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,760
you know or people's status is signaled

2127
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,040
on this part of their body

2128
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,719
or no it's in the eyes where you

2129
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,239
determine something

2130
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,080
so this is not just a

2131
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,840
a one-size-fits-all solution for human

2132
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,400
vision this is about a model framework

2133
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,080
that we could use to model what we want

2134
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,600
to model but

2135
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,560
a behavioral sequence is embodied by

2136
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,040
acting

2137
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,040
to converge towards beliefs about hidden

2138
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,719
ocular motor states so right there on

2139
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,640
the y-axis is this hidden ocular motor

2140
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,120
state

2141
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,960
and then there's the proprioceptive

2142
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,239
expectations

2143
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,679
so that's like if your muscle with one

2144
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,440
side like if your bicep contracts

2145
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,679
your tricep will relax and if that

2146
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:50,719
breaks down

2147
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,120
if that communication of expectations of

2148
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,679
oh hey i'm contracting or i'm contracted

2149
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,600
if that breaks down you get a lot of

2150
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,960
different types of muscle

2151
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,360
phenomena ranging from you know pulled

2152
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,040
muscles and strains to

2153
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,920
um like post injury or even without

2154
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,640
injury

2155
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,400
changes in the muscles perceived healthy

2156
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,840
range of motion or

2157
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,960
um limit or minimum maximum force and

2158
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,920
that has to do with a lot of the

2159
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,679
proprioceptive information being

2160
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,440
integrated with the beliefs about the

2161
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,159
hidden states

2162
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,960
what that results in is that observed

2163
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,960
sensory states

2164
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,679
um which uh uh these are the visual

2165
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:28,239
samples

2166
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,880
so that's we're taking one the hidden

2167
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,640
ocular motor states

2168
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,719
we converge towards belief on those what

2169
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:35,679
that results in

2170
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,280
is the observed sensory state so here's

2171
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,719
like an i an i an

2172
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,080
i and you know there's five dots here

2173
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,920
and so you're going to get more sampling

2174
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,280
on the eye but that's kind of what the

2175
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,920
camera

2176
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,040
sees and then it says absolute data or

2177
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,040
surprise or prediction error because

2178
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,880
this here is like showing the visual

2179
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,120
samples as kind of camera snapshots of

2180
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,640
what is being seen

2181
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,000
but in the predictive processing

2182
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,679
framework you could imagine

2183
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,440
that actually what's coming back is like

2184
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,400
a parameter update message passing

2185
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,120
thing that's actually about deep

2186
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,400
expectations about

2187
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,000
what to see so that's not even included

2188
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,280
in this model but that's part of other

2189
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,679
models

2190
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,960
and what that does when the sampling is

2191
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,040
like oh i expected an eye there i looked

2192
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,040
at her uh you know third eye

2193
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,760
and i didn't see it visually you know

2194
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,600
hypothesis confirmed

2195
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,880
so that type of sampling is also

2196
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,920
informative

2197
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,239
and so what we see on this graph is that

2198
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:33,600
the expectations

2199
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,880
about hidden perceptual states so are

2200
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,920
sort of fuzziness on the whole map

2201
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,120
uh decreases through time

2202
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,560
and what that results in is that the uh

2203
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,840
corresponding percept remains sharp and

2204
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,600
concurrent with a coherent generative

2205
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,000
model

2206
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,080
through time so i always just think

2207
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,600
about vision in this case

2208
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
like your whole visual field unless

2209
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,120
there's other secondary

2210
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,000
issues is clear and has color vision

2211
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,280
across the entire

2212
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,400
field and so this is maintained

2213
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
even though there's a large blind spot

2214
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,760
your resolution is lower

2215
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,679
outside of your center area and also

2216
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,360
there's not as much color or perception

2217
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,320
outside

2218
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,920
um there's a bunch of other visual

2219
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,239
illusions too so it's clearly we're

2220
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,719
perceiving our generative model visually

2221
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,080
and why not in other areas too when it's

2222
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,520
as clear or clearer so we have this face

2223
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,159
just coming

2224
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,719
into clarity based upon a deep

2225
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,520
generative

2226
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,360
prior which is why when there's things

2227
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,320
that you don't know how to extract the

2228
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,520
information from

2229
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,600
it's hard to know how to do ocular motor

2230
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,800
scanning let alone

2231
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,000
how to do the semantic mapping now

2232
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,040
isn't that the big question is will this

2233
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,000
kind of

2234
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,920
static face fixed image scanning

2235
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,280
to resolve uncertainty will that level

2236
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,480
of functional closure relate

2237
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,679
into eco evo scales of analysis

2238
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,120
so you could imagine this is just a

2239
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,520
static face doing classification but

2240
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,239
would this extend into adversarial

2241
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:07,920
relationships with one person

2242
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,320
would this extend into deep

2243
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,440
counterfactuals with valence

2244
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:15,199
and skills and

2245
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,600
team reformation hypotheses all these

2246
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,880
things playing out that

2247
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,000
are happening in social scenarios would

2248
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,520
that be able to play out this is just

2249
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,120
eye scanning so

2250
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,400
will that uh level of analysis

2251
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,679
of the group or the community the

2252
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,080
evolutionary trajectory the cultural

2253
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,440
unit

2254
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,640
the ecosystem any ecosystem

2255
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,800
will that level of analysis lend itself

2256
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,080
to this multi-level

2257
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,440
uh framework and isn't that

2258
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,480
the question so that is all

2259
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,560
i thought i would close with it as an

2260
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,080
opening to

2261
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,199
whether people thought yes or no or

2262
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,520
i think i'd like to know this piece of

2263
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,239
information

2264
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,040
before we made a decision i'm i'm open

2265
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,320
you know i want to learn more

2266
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,400
i want to figure out what that actual

2267
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,679
answer is

2268
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,679
is it going to be that we'll have some

2269
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,120
very tight

2270
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,360
and coherent markov blankets that uh we

2271
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,360
can just do simulations and understand

2272
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,880
the interactions between

2273
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,719
and then let that higher level parameter

2274
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,880
just move freely

2275
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,120
or will it really be the case that there

2276
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,480
are order parameters

2277
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,920
that are just beyond what we can

2278
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,719
currently

2279
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,800
understand as mapping onto this

2280
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,560
framework or some other framework

2281
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,400
who knows um anyways that was kind of an

2282
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,320
interesting discussion so i hope you

2283
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,040
liked it and i just say thanks for

2284
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,320
participating

2285
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,800
we will provide a follow-up form to live

2286
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,199
participants

2287
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,360
feedback suggestions and questions

2288
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,960
always welcome

2289
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,199
and yeah just stay in communication

2290
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,560
we're gonna have

2291
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,840
number 7.1 and 7.2

2292
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,040
in the coming two weeks and uh if you

2293
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,640
want to participate

2294
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,360
in your listening before them then get

2295
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,000
in touch

2296
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,400
also we'll hopefully still be

2297
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,159
looking for papers to read and for

2298
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,760
people to have on discussions

2299
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,280
as long as you're listening to this so

2300
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,800
just give

2301
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,360
us a comment or a message and it'd be

2302
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,719
good to get in touch

2303
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,840
so any thoughts especially on this video

2304
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,719
on

2305
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,120
where does the fep fit into all this

2306
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,640
where does active inference fit into all

2307
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,360
this

2308
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,800
what are we looking to understand with

2309
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,640
variational ecology how are we going to

2310
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,040
use

2311
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,600
variational ecology how is it going to

2312
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,000
map onto classical ecology

2313
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,679
what ecological questions are we going

2314
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,760
to be able to address first

2315
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,840
how is this going to relate to the kinds

2316
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,199
of explanations

2317
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,920
and design solutions that ecologists

2318
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,199
have worked with before

2319
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,480
versus propose deeply uh

2320
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,840
hypothetical systems a lot of

2321
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,080
interesting questions plus of course

2322
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,520
hearing from everyone else on their

2323
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,560
perspective on the implications or

2324
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,600
strengths or weaknesses so anyways cool

2325
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,080
thanks for listening i hope that you had

2326
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,040
a good

2327
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,719
time and found some parts of it

2328
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,159
interesting

2329
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:16,879
and i will talk to you later
