hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
to the active inference live stream this

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,320
is

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
active inference live stream 7.2 it is

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,079
november third

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,119
twenty twenty welcome to team com

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,000
everyone we are an experiment in online

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,199
team communication

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
learning and practice related to active

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,680
inference you can find us on twitter at

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
this is a recorded and an archived live

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
stream so please provide us feedback so

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
that we can improve on our work

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
welcome here

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
and also for video etiquette on live

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
stream remember to mute if it's noisy

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
raise your hands so we can hear from

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
everyone in the stack and use respectful

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,680
speech

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
today in act imp stream 7.2

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
we are going to go through our

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
introductions and have some warm-up

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,520
questions

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
and then we'll get into the discussion

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
of 7.2

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
we'll talk about the paper variational

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,760
ecology and the physics of sentient

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
systems

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
ramstead it all 2019 and we'll go over

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,799
the goals and the abstract

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
and the roadmap then we'll talk about

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
some big ideas and questions in ecology

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
and then we'll go through the figures i

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
remember last time we mentioned figure

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
six and so we've gone

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
the figures in reverse order so we'll

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,479
start with six and we'll just go down

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,680
from there

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
and also for the rest of 2020 we will be

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
discussing papers

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
8 9 10 and 11 which we'll go through in

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
a second

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,479
and just check out our twitter or

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,640
message us if you have any questions

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
so what are papers 8 9 10 and 11 and the

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,000
dates

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,159
paper 8 scaling active inference on

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
november 10th and 17th

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
all discussions are at uh 7 30 to

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,920
9 00 pst pacific standard time

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
in the morning paper 9 is

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
projective consciousness model and

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
phenomenal selfhood

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
paper 10 is a variational approach to

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
scripts and

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
paper 11 is sophisticated active

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,880
inference

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,560
which as we were just talking about

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
before the stream we'll also have

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
some cool accessory content let's go

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
to our intros and warm-ups so for this

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
part just introduce yourself

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
and your location you can say hello and

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
give a short introduction and then pass

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
to someone who hasn't spoken yet

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
so i'm daniel i'm in davis california

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,959
and i'll pass it to shannon

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
hi guys i'm shannon i'm usually in

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
merced california but i'm

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
in south dakota for the pandemic and

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,200
i'm going to pass it to ivan

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
hi everyone my name is ivan i'm from

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
moscow russia

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,959
and i pass it to sasha

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,840
hi everyone um i'm sasha and i'm in

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
california

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
and i'll pass it to marcus

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,319
hi i'm marcus um i am in

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
lean shopping which is a small town in

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,239
sweden a couple of hours outside of

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
stockholm

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
um and i gave a brief introduction to

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
myself because i'm new here

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
so my i did my phd in medical imaging

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
and my research is mainly focusing on

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
cardiovascular mri so quite different

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
from fap

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,159
and active inference which has become

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,440
sort of a hobby for me

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,879
the last couple years and i find these

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,799
live streams very good to explain

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,200
these concepts and i'm looking forward

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
to the discussion today so i'm gonna

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
pass over to cameron

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
hi i'm cameron i'm in zurich

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,239
i was here for the first time last week

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
and i

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
just started a phd in philosophy in

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
zurich

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
uh and i passed it on to

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,879
alex i'm alex

106
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,840
i'm in moscow russia i'm a researcher in

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,439
system management school

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:15,840
and i pass it to maxwell

109
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
right thank you hello everyone uh my

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
name is maxwell ramstead i'm a

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,479
postdoctoral fellow

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,840
at mcgill university and i'm zooming in

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,720
from

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
just outside montreal in the suburbs

115
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
and i'm a first author on this paper so

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
very excited to

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
discuss it with you

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
i i'm not has everyone spoken yet i

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
i lost track okay

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
great thanks for all the introductions

121
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
let's go to the warm-up questions

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
and here it'd be cool to hear from

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
everyone and you can just

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
answer as narrowly or as broadly as you

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
like

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
and go ahead and raise your hand if

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
you'd like to speak here

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
the first question is what is your niche

129
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,800
or what could it be so i'll just start

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,759
with my local

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
niche right now i'm looking at the video

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
screens i'm

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
trying to balance getting the

134
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
information from people's face versus

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,800
the

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
slides um what's another person's just

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
niche right now around them

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,080
or a related question is what skills

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
help us find affordances in a changing

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
world

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
so our niche definitely presents us with

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
uncertainty

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,759
multiple scales perhaps of uncertainty

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
what's behind me in the door or what

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
happens in the deep future

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
so how do we find affordances or how do

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
organisms find affordances in that kind

148
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,560
of a context

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
i liked your mention of your niche is

150
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
the computer screen and looking at

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
people's faces

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
i feel like for every different

153
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
communication program like if it's zoom

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
or jitsi

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
we can organize our digital environment

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
different ways so we can like see

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
different people's faces

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
or see different aspects of the screen

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
to allow for as much

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,919
non-verbal communication as we want or

161
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,560
need

162
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
to make that particular communication

163
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
effective

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
cameron um

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
for the first question um going back to

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,479
a niche i constructed for myself

167
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
about a year ago when i was coaching

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
tennis would often work in the

169
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,440
late afternoon to late in the evening

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
and i noticed how my diet changed to

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
make sure i had enough high enough sugar

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,120
level

173
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
so that i could give really energetic

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
lessons to the kids

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
in the late afternoon and then

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
sort of tone it down in terms of an

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,360
energy level for the adults

178
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
and then uh have a massive kind of slump

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
as soon as i got home so i could sleep

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
properly for the next

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
kind of round of coaching so i noticed

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
how my kind of diet

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,479
set up my energy levels just for that

184
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
kind of lifestyle and as soon as i

185
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
stopped coaching tennis

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
it was uh away with the biscuits and

187
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,560
chocolate

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
yep that kind of just reminds me of like

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,840
looking forward to dinner you're not

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
exactly sure what it's going to be but

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
it's going to be a physiological thing

192
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
it's going to reduce your uncertainty

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
about food

194
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
anyways what is one thing that you are

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
curious about or you want to explore in

196
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
today's discussion

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
so that could be something that you

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
wanted to figure out from the paper or

199
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,319
something that the paper

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,520
kind of resonated with you or just

201
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,160
something

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
from the side from the rest of your life

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
that came into context

204
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,599
today when thinking about this paper

205
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,800
so i'll start one thing that kind of

206
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
motivated me in the slides was just

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
exploring how the variational ecology is

208
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,759
linked to

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,560
big questions in so-called i guess

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
traditional ecology

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,919
non-fep non-active inference ecology how

212
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,319
do we

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
make that connection because if that

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
connection can be made

215
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,039
then the expansion of the theory from

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,000
just a few equations to something that's

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
in use in a lot of

218
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
applied situations would be a lot more

219
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,198
easy

220
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,320
any other random thoughts or that's

221
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
totally

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
chill we can just go on to the paper and

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
people can raise their thoughts

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,080
as they see fit i mean i'd be curious to

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,399
hear

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,959
uh like everyone else on this like what

227
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
did you hope to get from this

228
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
uh because as the author i can respond

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,839
to some of these questions so

230
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
let's go cameron and then shannon

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,199
muted sorry

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
at the very end uh maxwell you

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
you write about shared intentionality

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
and i wondered how

235
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,720
you think about the debate between

236
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
shared intentionality and

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
theories of mind and

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,480
that kind of kind of very mentalistic

239
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
idea of interaction

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
yeah i had that sort of same topic of

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
shared intentionality

242
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
i was also wondering um in our

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
universities like seminary yesterday we

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
were talking about collective memory

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
and i wonder whether this

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
like variational ecology can

247
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
tell us anything about what we choose to

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
remember or what we

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
end up remembering as a culture or as a

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
society about

251
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
our culture's past it might not

252
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
it might be that might be a little

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
abstract for what we're talking about

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,720
currently since it's not necessarily

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
behavior or it's a behavior

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
that we have to verbalize and speak out

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,360
loud but

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
those are great questions yep

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
i agree on the part about remembering

260
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,279
it's like there's this multi-level

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
remembering process how much data do we

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
retain from yesterday from

263
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,440
two seconds ago from 200 years ago from

264
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
2 million years ago

265
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
and then there's all always different

266
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
perspectives on just the

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,200
facts or the events of whatever did or

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,720
didn't occur and all this narrative

269
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
weaving that occurs so how we

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
model and remodel how we update our

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,640
models of those

272
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
multi-scale memory processes some of

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
them are extended some are internal

274
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
that's everything so i think it's really

275
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,640
interesting question

276
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,319
i hope we'll return to that sasha

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
um yeah that's a kind of great point to

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
link it all together that

279
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
um individuals that are interacting

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
um can spur more i guess memories or

281
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,880
common experiences

282
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
by revealing more or less about their

283
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
current niche

284
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
um and so yeah just really thinking

285
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
about how

286
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,959
individuals should um or should not

287
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,000
interact

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
um when trying to build common ground um

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
and how much of their niche they should

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,320
be sharing uh in that communication

291
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
but yeah a lot of uh fun things with

292
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
that in the virtual space

293
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
um that we can reveal to each other

294
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
cool i think that hopefully sets the

295
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
stage to talk about

296
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
some of the specifics of the paper and

297
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
also big ideas in ecology

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
and also things are happening all around

299
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
us so the paper is

300
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,519
variational ecology in the physics of

301
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
sentient systems from 2019

302
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
and we reviewed the goal of the paper

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,720
last week

304
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
but the shorthand kind of equation form

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,160
is that

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
variational neuroethology vne which is

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,360
about

308
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
organisms and their neurobiology

309
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,279
primarily

310
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
can be kind of jointed together with

311
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,480
vanc

312
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
the variational approach to niche

313
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,839
construction and then

314
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
that summation that continuation of

315
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,519
explanation from kind of the

316
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,560
neurobiology

317
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,399
into the extended niche is called

318
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,000
variational ecology

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
and then the non-active inference

320
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,440
phrasing would be

321
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,639
something like how do you make a

322
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,200
multi-scale ecology framework that

323
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
builds on

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,240
ecology evolution and development and

325
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
also adds in insight from physics

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
mathematics and complexity

327
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
we also talked about the roadmap

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,760
last week and sort of formulaic in that

329
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
it introduces the two separate ideas

330
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,079
in section two and three and then adds

331
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,959
them together

332
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,079
to result in a synthesis framework

333
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,480
represented here and with the connector

334
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
added between the uh

335
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
active orange connector to the purple so

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
to kind of just start the discussion i

337
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
wanted to begin with some big questions

338
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,760
in ecology

339
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
and some other people may have done

340
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
ecology

341
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
in a specific formal or informal way but

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
there's so much to it

343
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
and it's just interesting to connect it

344
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
to the questions that motivated

345
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,440
that field before this kind of synthesis

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,839
of

347
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,920
even ecology evolution and development

348
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
which is its own pyramid of

349
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
you know ideas that connected and people

350
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
who bridged evolution and ecology and

351
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
all these kinds of things so let's just

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
look at the big questions in ecology

353
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
and think about the context that this

354
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
synthesis is happening in

355
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
and then think about all the cases where

356
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
ecology is applied so conservation and

357
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
policy planning and stuff and then think

358
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,200
about how a mapping between

359
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,079
fep and active inference broadly and

360
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:36,880
ecology

361
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,639
could allow for a lot of translational

362
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
and applied use

363
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
so here's one kind of interesting

364
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
historical coincidence

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
it's a 1983 paper by richard lewinton

366
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
called the organism as the subject and

367
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
object of evolution

368
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839
so this is kind of before the whole uh

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
physics in biology approach was becoming

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
mainstreamed but he was coming from a

371
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,639
very

372
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
integrationist perspective and he wrote

373
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,160
before darwin

374
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
theories of historical change were all

375
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
transformational that is systems were

376
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,279
seen as undergoing change in time

377
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,639
because each element in the system

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,160
underwent an individual transformation

379
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,600
during its life history so like the

380
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
muscle cells became different or

381
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
something

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
lamarck's theory of evolution was

383
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
transformational in regarding species as

384
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
changing because each individual

385
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,519
organism

386
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
underwent the same change through inner

387
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
will and striving an organism would

388
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
change its nature and that change would

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
be transmitted to offspring so that's

390
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
what people often call the marquee in

391
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,160
evolution

392
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
now here's where the historical

393
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
coincidence is

394
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
in contrast darwin proposed a

395
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,120
variational principle now it turns out

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,440
that

397
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
this is a different variational

398
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,199
principle than the variational principle

399
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,399
from physics that we're going to be

400
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
discussing but i thought it was really

401
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
interesting that lewinton and darwin

402
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
use the same idea and so what's the idea

403
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
individual members of the ensemble

404
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
differ from each other in some

405
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,480
properties

406
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
and that the system evolves by changes

407
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,440
in the proportion of different types

408
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,199
there's a sorting out process dot

409
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
dot and so variation among objects is

410
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,000
transformed into temporal variation

411
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,399
a dynamic process arises in time as the

412
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
consequence of static variation in space

413
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
there's no historical process other than

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,760
the evolution of living organisms that

415
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
has this variational form at least as

416
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
far as we know

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
so that's actually going a long ways

418
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
towards this sort of what is

419
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,639
schrodinger's

420
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
question about what is life just an

421
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
interesting

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
way that variational has interwoven from

423
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
the history

424
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
of biology from darwin from lewinton and

425
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
now finding itself with a formal

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,639
definition

427
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,399
ironically with the same name related to

428
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
variational principles so anyways

429
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
sorry for the little bit of a

430
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,440
uh history side let's get to the ecology

431
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
questions and if anyone has thoughts on

432
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
that previous link they can kind of

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
address it here

434
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
these are some questions drawn from a

435
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,519
1999

436
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
paper by sir robert may called

437
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
unanswered questions in ecology

438
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
so we can figure that they're probably

439
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
still unanswered but

440
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
let's just look at some of these and if

441
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
anyone wants to reflect on it

442
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
how do they see it playing out or how

443
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
do they think or wonder that active

444
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
inference could play into it

445
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,839
i'll put up the first two what

446
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,680
determines population density

447
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
and what determines the spatial

448
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
structure of population these are

449
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,839
actually like the first two

450
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,440
that may brings up so what what

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,839
could an answer to this look like

452
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,560
uh or where do you think

453
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,279
the fep and ecology could intersect here

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,240
i'll just list them all also how can we

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
study stability and complexity in

456
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,959
ecological

457
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
communities and what is the proper scale

458
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
of analysis for ecological studies in

459
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,240
space and time

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
so what might be an approach or what

461
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,079
might be a mapping

462
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:51,839
that we could draw here

463
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
one thought is the proper scale of

464
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,079
analysis for ecological studies

465
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,759
is kind of related to our discussion

466
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,440
about what time scales

467
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
ergotic systems or the ergotic

468
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
hypothesis

469
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
exists at because there might be some

470
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
time scales or spatial scales that don't

471
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,000
make sense to study

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
like if you're studying the lion hunting

473
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,199
the gazelle

474
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
the centimeter squared time scale or

475
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,480
spatial scale

476
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
in the one second might not capture some

477
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
important dynamics of the system

478
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
but then if you study it at too broad a

479
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,959
level it might be

480
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,640
not able to be studied for another way

481
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,720
just happening too fast underlying

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,000
so just one thought there

483
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
anyone wanna yeah shannon go ahead

484
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
yeah so i don't study ecology but um i

485
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
know we've learned some about

486
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
like predator prey models so population

487
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,039
density

488
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,960
is determined by you know the amount of

489
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,120
resources in the environment

490
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
and as the praise depleted then the

491
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,760
predators depleted because they don't

492
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
have enough food so the prey can come

493
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
back and you have this

494
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
structure over time and

495
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
the same kind of thing happens even with

496
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,760
with trees and

497
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
these beetles that eat trees so you'll

498
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
see like forests even

499
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,640
over a much longer time skill having um

500
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
like trees that die out and then they

501
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,919
grow back eventually and the beetle

502
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,799
population will

503
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,440
also follow that predator prey structure

504
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
and die out and come back

505
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,000
yes so there's these rhythms and some

506
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,039
slower ones

507
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
some are across species some are within

508
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,640
a species

509
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
they're all related to measurements so

510
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
at the very least we're going to be able

511
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,960
to use

512
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,760
different mathematical frameworks to

513
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,200
analyze our measurement

514
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
just like we use different statistical

515
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
tests but the deeper question

516
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
is whether the fep or whether the active

517
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
inference framework describes

518
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
what these ecological communities are

519
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,720
doing or what is actually occurring

520
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
versus to what extent it's a really

521
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,080
convenient model

522
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,679
fitting approach um all right the second

523
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,919
next slide yeah what would the

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,360
difference in implication be

525
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,960
i mean uh i think uh

526
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
the proper philosophy of science

527
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
attitude to have with regards to any

528
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
scientific model whatsoever

529
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
is that truth has nothing to do with

530
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
what science is doing i mean this might

531
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,679
be slightly controversial but

532
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
i think science has to do with uh

533
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,600
model comparison effectively i mean all

534
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
of science has moved into this kind of

535
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
kind of game i think where what we're

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
doing is so first of all

537
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,360
data is never presented in a naked way

538
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,919
right

539
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,240
uh so you know your neuroimaging data

540
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
for example will be organized as a

541
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,799
kind of a heat map of the brain for

542
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
example like data is always presented as

543
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
a model of data

544
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,160
and basically what we're doing is

545
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
confronting different theoretical and

546
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
formal models

547
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
to find which explains uh away the

548
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
variance in our data the best

549
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,440
so from that point of view we needn't

550
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,280
read the free energy principle as making

551
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
any literal claim

552
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,679
about anything just the same way that

553
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,799
you know

554
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
uh any other scientific model is just

555
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
going to be kind of a

556
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,200
it's a useful description so i'm

557
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
i'm putting on my mel andrews hat today

558
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
and being an anti-realist but

559
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,320
uh or i mean a non-realist right like

560
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
it's just

561
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,720
uh it's not like newton's laws became

562
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,039
false after you know they were shown to

563
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,360
be a special case of relativistic

564
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,640
uh you know dynamics these are just like

565
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
successively better

566
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
models that successively and iteratively

567
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
explain away the variance in our data

568
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
better

569
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
but i don't know if it's appropriate to

570
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,919
ask the question you know

571
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,840
are these merely models or actually the

572
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
way that the world works i mean

573
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,840
i mean that's the quote right all models

574
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
are wrong but some are useful

575
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,039
exactly yep and then the what is useful

576
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
must always be unpacked to to whom

577
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
and who else is influenced by it and

578
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
then what is their value structure and

579
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
all these types of second order effects

580
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,600
and and i

581
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
agree that if nothing else it's a useful

582
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,919
multi-scale framework just like a

583
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,720
multi-level

584
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,919
regressor regressor model or the

585
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,720
gaussian distribution i mean linear

586
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
modeling is used for some computational

587
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
benefits so

588
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
yeah it's unfortunate when it does

589
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
constrain the

590
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,679
phenotypic distributions in the world

591
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
but perhaps with flexible tools we could

592
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,679
actually accommodate for

593
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,080
very very high dimensional preference

594
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,919
systems or things like that

595
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
rather than using like a excel

596
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,960
spreadsheet that

597
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
takes an average and then aggregates

598
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,559
that into the next level of the

599
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,520
aggregator

600
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
so how could we go and look at variation

601
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
across multiple levels of the system and

602
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
yeah good interesting things there

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
let's look at a few more just classic

604
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
ecology questions before we

605
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
go to the figures so this is from a

606
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
2013 paper in journal of ecology called

607
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
identification of 100 fundamental

608
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
ecological questions

609
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,559
so those are just the little small ones

610
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,679
um i'm just going to list

611
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,840
all 20 of them that i just grabbed the

612
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
first 20

613
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
um so people could can uh think just you

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,280
know pick a random number

615
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,440
spin something roll roll three die

616
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
whatever it is

617
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
but these were just the questions that

618
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,039
this large set of authors basically

619
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
used some polling and discussion

620
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
methodology

621
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,559
to converge on these 100 questions and

622
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
so they definitely thought about which

623
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,960
ones to put

624
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,559
at the beginning and they definitely

625
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,919
thought about which ones to include so i

626
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,280
just think these are kind of

627
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,640
what ecologists broadly may

628
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,039
find to be some of the biggest questions

629
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,000
so that means

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
that if somebody can make a connection

631
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
where something that was previously

632
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
modeled in an incomplete or

633
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,919
in a really hetero heterogeneous

634
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,280
framework

635
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
if there's a way to model it in a more

636
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,640
unified way

637
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
then that's something that addresses a

638
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
fundamental question in ecology

639
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
and so that's one of the ways that we

640
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
can apply theory

641
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,919
and then think about what are the

642
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,919
downstream applications like look at

643
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,520
their number one question

644
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
what are the evolutionary consequences

645
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
of species becoming less connected

646
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,159
through fragmentation or more connected

647
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,360
through globalization

648
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,679
so that's roads being built that break

649
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
uh migration corridors

650
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
that's also barnacles being brought

651
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
around by global

652
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
fishing fleets and so different species

653
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,320
and different

654
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,400
ecosystems are connected in new ways

655
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,280
their markov blankets their ergotic

656
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,799
levels of analysis these are all

657
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,400
changing and so

658
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
how is that going to shape phenotypic

659
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
and behavioral and genetic diversity

660
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,880
that's conservation ecology so

661
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
if that can be re-understood or

662
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
mapped into a active inference framework

663
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,480
it's again at the very least a super

664
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
useful way to think about multi-scale

665
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,799
systems

666
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
because it includes that bottom-up and

667
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,080
top-down

668
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,559
element which a lot of these questions

669
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,840
implicitly include

670
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
but often through very constrained ways

671
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,960
like

672
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
uh specific types of partial

673
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
differential equations or

674
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
specific types of simulations that

675
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,919
aren't really grounded in this type of

676
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,360
methodology

677
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,919
and then um yeah i just think that's

678
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,039
kind of an interesting

679
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,559
thing so i thought that's that's why

680
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,480
it's worth taking the time to

681
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
at least look through some of these

682
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
anyone can raise their hand if they want

683
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
to jump in on one of these

684
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,919
1 through 20 but like it's just useful

685
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,880
to think about these because these are

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,320
the questions that people want to see

687
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,600
answered in ecology shannon

688
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,000
i mean number five is exactly what we're

689
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
addressing if we're asking what can

690
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
multi-scale

691
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,679
uh free energy tell us about

692
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,760
these different levels of of selection

693
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
and also different levels of behavior

694
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,960
or different levels of insert phenomena

695
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,000
you're interested in here

696
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
yep what are the relative contributions

697
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,919
of different levels of selection gene

698
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,880
individual group

699
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
it's a life history evolution and the

700
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
resulting population dynamics

701
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
yep definitely something that's super

702
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,480
interesting to think about

703
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
and does a variational principle that

704
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,480
links these levels of analysis like if

705
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,240
you have a multi-level regression

706
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
model you don't say that one level has

707
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,559
causal priority over the other level

708
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
it's just a different way that variance

709
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,039
was partitioned

710
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,039
and that reminds me of evelyn fox

711
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,200
keller's metaphor

712
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,679
of the two people who are pumping water

713
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,720
together

714
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
and that's the nature nurture so-called

715
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,919
and that's

716
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,080
how you can uh really do a partitioning

717
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,240
of labor only for certain tasks but not

718
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
for kind of shared tasks

719
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
like her water pumping example and so

720
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,039
maybe the partitioning is a statistical

721
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,080
post hoc and

722
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
some traits will partition highly on to

723
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
heritability or some traits partition

724
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,039
highly onto some other

725
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,760
uh uni-dimensional axes but then in a

726
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
fuller variational framework

727
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
we would have a more nuanced way to talk

728
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,279
about how those parts are related

729
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,039
yep and then another question that is

730
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,200
definitely related to the whole area is

731
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,080
16.

732
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
how do organisms make movement decisions

733
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
in relation to dispersal

734
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,799
migration foraging or mate search so

735
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,080
definitely a lot of

736
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,039
work on everything from the ocular motor

737
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,720
epistemic foraging

738
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
the movement of the eyes towards

739
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
informative areas of the visual space to

740
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,000
focus on

741
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
to search behavior and not could be in

742
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,760
an

743
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
abstract computational space so many of

744
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
the optimization algorithms we know

745
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,320
are named after animals because they're

746
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
kind of bio-inspired ant colony

747
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,440
optimization

748
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,919
cuckoo search all these kinds of things

749
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,440
are related to

750
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
ecologically observed strategies so

751
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
maybe if we had a way to frame

752
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,679
those different strategies in nature we

753
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,919
could do bio discovery and then we could

754
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,400
implement a lot of cool ways to who

755
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
knows what you know

756
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,039
optimize things make uh swarms of robots

757
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,559
that are useful

758
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,440
who knows what should happen okay um

759
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,640
number eleven

760
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,679
also uh that what is the what are the

761
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
evolutionary and ecological mechanisms

762
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,159
that govern species range margins

763
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,039
um that reminds me of this uh concept in

764
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,679
ecology of uh the fundamental versus

765
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
realized niche

766
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,480
um and so i think that has

767
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,760
a lot of uh nice parallels to um

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,159
kind of how humans behave but also

769
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,279
thinking about um

770
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
cognition and how we

771
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,279
uh choose to think about the world and

772
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
what sort of niches that

773
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,080
uh that model is tailored to

774
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
what is the fundamental versus the

775
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
realized niche

776
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,120
um uh full disclosure i also do not

777
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
study ecology but i'm teaching an intro

778
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,559
to bio class

779
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
to freshmen um and so i'm learning about

780
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,600
this

781
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,559
uh as i go as well it's it's kind of fun

782
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,200
um but

783
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
the fundamental is the

784
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,840
environment uh the combination of bio

785
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
abiotic factors

786
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
that allow an organism to survive so

787
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
anywhere where you could live

788
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,840
um and then the realized niche is uh

789
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
where you actually do

790
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,039
live based on your interactions with

791
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,399
other species and other

792
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,840
biotic factors that influence your

793
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,559
niche do you know what this overlaps

794
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,360
with corolla

795
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,600
thoughts's concepts of the developmental

796
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,959
versus the selective niche

797
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,200
so as thoughts basically argues that

798
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,159
effectively uh you can think of the

799
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:34,799
niche

800
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,960
as the set of selection pressures to

801
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
which organisms are subject

802
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
but also as the set of reliably

803
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,200
inherited resources that are necessary

804
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,360
for the reconstitution of the life cycle

805
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
in every generation and that in

806
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,399
ideally they coincide but they don't

807
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,679
necessarily

808
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,919
uh so that you know your developmental

809
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,880
niche

810
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,799
ideally prepares you for the pressures

811
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,720
that you'll be you know undergoing

812
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,520
in your selective niche uh but you know

813
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,279
for various you know evolutionary

814
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,399
reasons or other

815
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,760
you might be tuned to the wrong

816
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,679
environment for example and then die off

817
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,320
so

818
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
uh but it does seem to overlap with the

819
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,360
distinction that you're mentioning here

820
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,399
wow very interesting and

821
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,200
the changes in the uh in different

822
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,679
things

823
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,799
can lead to the realized niche where

824
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,240
things actually exist

825
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
if the population hits a critical point

826
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,360
then it can just

827
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,919
extinct locally or or even regionally

828
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,159
and that doesn't that's like a non-uh

829
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,520
recoverable state

830
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
and so it can change uh

831
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,279
in a very like the niche can be modified

832
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,159
rapidly

833
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,840
and so that definitely relates to it

834
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
let's actually do one more slide on

835
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
niche and affordances

836
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
and then this is before we just get to

837
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
the figure so if anyone has any more

838
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:48,960
like general

839
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
thoughts now we're bridging the gap

840
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,080
we're

841
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
seeing how the regular ecology brings

842
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,399
over to this new way of thinking about

843
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:56,960
it

844
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
so niche and affordance are linked and

845
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,919
that's kind of cool that we just were

846
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,279
talking about that

847
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,640
because there's the niche example here

848
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
is the different birds so flamingo is

849
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,320
digging the deepest into the dirt

850
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,360
to or under the water to get food the

851
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
um birds on the right are going more

852
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
shallowly and so their beaks are

853
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
different their behavior is different

854
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
everything is different about their

855
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
biology and

856
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,120
they may or may not be able to have uh

857
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,640
general versus specialty

858
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,399
like maybe the flamingo can also get the

859
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,080
shallow but not vice versa or something

860
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,880
like that

861
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,640
so that's a sort of physical niche

862
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
concept but our niche

863
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,440
includes objects includes other people

864
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
and trees and

865
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,279
bike paths and digital experiences as

866
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,240
well

867
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,520
so what happens now that technology is

868
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,399
part of the human

869
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,559
informational and ecological niche maybe

870
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,000
bringing in what was just being

871
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,679
discussed about the fundamental

872
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,919
and the realized as well as the

873
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
selective and the developmental

874
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,679
niche concepts so how could active

875
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,120
inference be used to

876
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,080
to understand and model and design in

877
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,399
these situations

878
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,919
so i gotta start there is for politics

879
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,320
or

880
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,480
for information systems especially with

881
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
digital

882
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,960
there is certainly a vast number of uh

883
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,760
degrees of freedom in the design and the

884
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,519
realized info niche that we're in is

885
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,120
just like literally whichever whichever

886
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,760
one we're in

887
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,919
however it ends up whoever's behind the

888
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,279
scenes doing whatever that's the

889
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
realized one we're gonna get

890
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
but what is the fundamental info niche

891
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,799
what is the actual

892
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,559
bigger habitable space and which parts

893
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
of that habitable space might have

894
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
some features or some benefits that we

895
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,480
don't

896
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
realize through our current uh

897
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,320
existence in that realizable so

898
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
conceptually i would want to distinguish

899
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,000
between the physical environment and the

900
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,039
niche

901
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,120
uh so the way that we're defining it at

902
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
least the niche is the set of

903
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
affordances to which

904
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,360
organisms are sensitive so that doesn't

905
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,399
overlap

906
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,279
exactly with the physical environment um

907
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,840
so

908
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
i mean two species can share the same

909
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
physical environment

910
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
but not occupy the same niche because

911
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,240
they're not sensitive to the same things

912
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,640
uh so you know like something may be

913
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,159
like a prey item for one

914
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,240
and just be like you know part of the

915
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,279
background

916
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,480
uh for another species uh

917
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
so i think that's how you get around

918
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,039
that uh i was confronted by kim sterily

919
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,399
uh when we we talked we gave a talk in

920
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,360
australia

921
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
i think in 2017 or 18

922
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,919
about this and i think this helps to

923
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,240
dissolve that issue there isn't like one

924
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
ecological niche there's one physical

925
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
environment that we all share

926
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,840
and then relative to uh essentially the

927
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,919
the skills and the concerns that we

928
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,880
embody

929
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
uh the world will appear very

930
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
differently and

931
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,159
so we we live in different niches even

932
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,440
if the physical environment overlaps

933
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,399
okay yvonne

934
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,279
yeah thank you if if we return that

935
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,320
now we share one virtual

936
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,600
niche uh we do it by

937
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,880
uh our brain work and

938
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,919
before the internet we can

939
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,960
uh speak with each other

940
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
just to physically present

941
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
near or by telephone but now

942
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,279
we can we can do it

943
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,760
we can choose what type of communication

944
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,600
we can choose the type of communication

945
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,880
and

946
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,600
so we construct

947
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
different ways to

948
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,360
create niche itself

949
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,399
yes thanks for sharing that

950
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,679
and it's uh i i hear you max well

951
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,399
on the niche concept definitely an idea

952
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,240
that ecologists have debated over

953
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,760
as much as um species

954
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,239
but the uh idea of the shared

955
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
informational resource

956
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,599
let's go with that certainly there are

957
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,199
things that are becoming knowledge

958
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,399
resources that are

959
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,079
not only uh non-evenly shared across the

960
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,359
globe but also are related to new kinds

961
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,480
of informational connections that

962
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,359
haven't occurred

963
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,399
in any individual sensory niche

964
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,839
hearing languages that one wouldn't have

965
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,760
heard access to perspectives and

966
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,399
the high-throughput nature of media so

967
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,679
these are all

968
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,760
things that i think change our our

969
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,800
match or mismatch or our fitness between

970
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,639
our evolutionary priors on biofeedback

971
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
or on safety or on the

972
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,040
veracity of language these kinds of

973
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,839
things

974
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,119
are being connected and being

975
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,680
played out in new ways so i would think

976
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
how can active inference be used to

977
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,960
understand and design these

978
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,640
situations well we can define the remote

979
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,599
team

980
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,160
and we can also think of it as almost a

981
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
reduced

982
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
case and a known mismatch case with our

983
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,079
own

984
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,800
like quote natural ecology but first our

985
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,560
ecology is so flexible

986
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,320
and humans have displayed so many

987
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
lifestyles that this is really one of

988
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
many there's no reference wild type

989
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,200
that's one thing

990
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,440
and then the second thing is when you

991
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,680
take an animal into a laboratory

992
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,880
you know that it's not going to be

993
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
getting the same microbiome or the sun

994
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
or the temperature variability or the

995
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
prey or the predator or whatever it is

996
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,320
but you

997
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,680
you go you forego that degree of freedom

998
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,119
and naturalism

999
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,760
for an element of controllability and so

1000
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,839
in ecology they do a lot of mesoscale

1001
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,720
experiments

1002
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
where they'll set up like 200 fish tanks

1003
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,359
and add exactly three salmon and exactly

1004
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,720
11 algae and

1005
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,480
set up these these tanks and they can

1006
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,920
demonstrate things like

1007
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,320
dynamic oscillatory systems or like a

1008
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
instability point with the ratios of

1009
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,640
different

1010
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
initial conditions of two different

1011
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
species or the role of different

1012
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,640
nutrients

1013
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
and then the the critique just like it

1014
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
is with animal behavior in the

1015
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,119
laboratory is like well that's not

1016
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,280
exactly the natural ecosystem

1017
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
and so it's just an interesting topic

1018
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
how in ecology there's this continuum

1019
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,599
from

1020
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,839
super long scale systems like cosmology

1021
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,839
that you're never going to be able to

1022
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,320
uh intervene in or make experiments

1023
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
about like tectonic plate level

1024
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
understandings of biodiversity ranging

1025
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,839
to very local

1026
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,280
understandings that are often very

1027
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
controlled but then

1028
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,119
those are often subject to the same

1029
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,040
kinds of holistic criticisms that

1030
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,359
so many other frameworks are and so to

1031
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,320
turn again to

1032
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,400
active inference there's a way to build

1033
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,359
positively

1034
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,599
on this and just think great there's

1035
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,200
this mismatch between levels or at least

1036
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,839
apparently

1037
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,920
why don't we kind of think from the top

1038
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
down and set out a really

1039
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,560
big scaffold for multi-level systems and

1040
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
then we'll figure out how to

1041
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
map different levels and scales of

1042
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,240
analysis within this just like people

1043
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,599
learned how to use multi-level

1044
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,560
regression

1045
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
this is going to be like a variational

1046
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,119
tool at that kind of category or

1047
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,800
of that kind of type all right

1048
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,880
figure six so here maxwell on figure six

1049
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,040
i'll let you take a first pass but the

1050
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,920
next slide if you

1051
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,480
just you let me know if you want the box

1052
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,160
to come up but let's just focus on this

1053
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,040
uh image and maybe start off just like

1054
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,520
what

1055
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
does it convey or what is it there for

1056
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
but go ahead

1057
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,800
okay uh just let me pull up the

1058
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,960
the figure myself all right

1059
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,680
um it's called a particular partition

1060
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
it's a point

1061
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,359
yeah just to explain it i know that i

1062
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,960
just wanted in front of me while i

1063
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,520
explained

1064
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,119
well so basically this this figure

1065
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,400
um explains how

1066
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,599
uh you add i mean i i would

1067
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,480
i would prefer to explain things in

1068
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,160
terms of the

1069
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
figure figure 3

1070
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
because this is the slightly more

1071
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,960
technically complicated

1072
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,359
uh version of the figure three like it

1073
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,320
it

1074
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
figure six basically tells you how you

1075
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,160
uh

1076
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
i mean effectively take a bunch of

1077
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,520
states and

1078
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,240
like add add them to the superordinate

1079
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
scale but i think it's slightly easier

1080
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,119
to explain

1081
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,520
using figure three so what we basically

1082
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,400
do

1083
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,240
is we're going to take a bunch of states

1084
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,640
that comprise our system

1085
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,359
and then partition it in partition those

1086
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,839
states into markov blankets

1087
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,280
and then from there um construct

1088
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
a uh a reconstruct the system at the

1089
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,760
superordinate scale on the basis of

1090
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,359
these markov blankets

1091
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,480
so uh basically in new work

1092
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
um especially in the particular physics

1093
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
monograph

1094
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,119
uh we speak of this in terms of two

1095
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,240
operators

1096
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,760
that we use uh g and r

1097
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,240
uh g is a grouping operator effectively

1098
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
and it allows us to construct

1099
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
uh markov blankets from the base uh

1100
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,520
states

1101
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,760
uh that we're considering and then r

1102
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,680
takes these mark all blankets and then

1103
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,119
reduces their dimensionality

1104
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,720
so i mean effectively we're going to be

1105
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,160
dropping some of the states

1106
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,359
uh to construct the states at the scale

1107
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,160
above

1108
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,119
so we start with a bunch of states and

1109
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,800
uh these are all the states that

1110
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,000
are of interest uh to us in the system

1111
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,760
uh so you know um

1112
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,680
these can i mean these can be literally

1113
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,280
any states whatsoever

1114
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,040
these techniques have been used recently

1115
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,200
to partition

1116
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,560
fmri data so when when you're dealing

1117
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,400
with fmri data

1118
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,280
each state is a voxel so a 3d pixel

1119
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,480
effectively

1120
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,599
and so what we do from there

1121
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,040
is you have all of your states and you

1122
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,960
have this continuous time series data

1123
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,160
typically

1124
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,880
and um so what you do is you construct

1125
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
an adjacency matrix

1126
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,119
um so an adjacency matrix is essentially

1127
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,720
you're plotting all of your states by

1128
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,760
all of your states

1129
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,680
such as the diagonal is basically like

1130
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
you know your degree of self coupling

1131
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
and what you do is you populate this

1132
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,560
matrix

1133
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,040
with uh coefficients that express how

1134
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,000
tightly

1135
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,960
uh this state and that state are coupled

1136
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,040
and then so from this adjacency matrix

1137
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,000
what you do

1138
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
is uh you take the jacobian and the

1139
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,839
hessian

1140
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,119
of these adjacency matrices so the

1141
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,640
jacobian and the hessian

1142
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,040
are basically the same matrix but rather

1143
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
than having the coupling coefficient

1144
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,800
uh in each entry what you have is the

1145
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
partial derivatives

1146
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
of each entry so effectively this is a

1147
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,319
very

1148
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,000
technical and complicated way of saying

1149
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
what we're looking at is the relative

1150
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
rates of change of every variable with

1151
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
respect to every

1152
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
other variable the reason we're doing

1153
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
this is that a zero

1154
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,800
in these uh you know uh matrices that

1155
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
contain the partial derivatives

1156
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,160
means that effectively there's no

1157
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,960
relative

1158
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,079
change meaning that like you can

1159
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,079
you can vary one of the variables and

1160
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,440
the other one doesn't

1161
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,640
change so this is a way of testing for

1162
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,800
conditional independence

1163
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,440
is the short story so basically using

1164
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,960
these mathematical techniques what you

1165
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
do is you read off the conditional

1166
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,119
independencies

1167
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,000
from this coupling matrix this adjacency

1168
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,960
matrix

1169
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,680
and from there you're able to rebuild

1170
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,240
the

1171
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,480
uh well you're able to construct markov

1172
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,000
blankets in terms of the

1173
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,839
states that are independent of each

1174
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,079
other conditioned on other states

1175
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,400
so i mean to recap we started with a

1176
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,760
bunch of states that just

1177
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,040
composed the system that we're

1178
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,839
interested in explaining at one scale

1179
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,640
we put these states through a grouping

1180
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,680
operator

1181
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,800
that chunks it into markov blanketed

1182
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
particles based on the conditional and

1183
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,119
tendencies

1184
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,960
and so this takes us from the bottom of

1185
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,160
the figure to the top

1186
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,520
uh top left so what we're left with

1187
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,440
after applying the grouping operator

1188
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,760
is a bunch of markup blankets

1189
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,839
effectively

1190
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,280
mark all blanketed particles so

1191
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,079
then in order to get to the next scale

1192
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,440
what we do is we reduce the

1193
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,560
dimensionality

1194
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,480
of this uh partitioned set of states

1195
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
so effectively what we're doing is we're

1196
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,920
dropping the internal states

1197
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,359
and the fast um stable modes

1198
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,400
of interaction at every scale in order

1199
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,280
to construct

1200
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
the states at the level above and this

1201
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
gets us uh basically

1202
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,319
from the uh it's the it's the other half

1203
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:46,880
of the

1204
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,240
image basically moving from these uh

1205
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,440
these partitioned uh states

1206
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,119
uh back to uh a new set of states at the

1207
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,880
superordinate scale so

1208
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,839
conceptually what we're saying is that

1209
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,480
states

1210
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
at a superordinate scale are literally

1211
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,280
constituted by the slow

1212
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,000
meta-stable modes of interaction between

1213
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,599
states at the level below

1214
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,520
so just conceptually this means that you

1215
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
take say an organ like the heart

1216
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,160
well the heart itself is constituted by

1217
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,480
the slower modes of interaction among

1218
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,880
heart

1219
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
cells so for example like you know uh

1220
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,839
the uh the main compartments of the

1221
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,880
heart for example

1222
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,040
are literally constituted by the modes

1223
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
of interaction

1224
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,119
uh between the cells that are components

1225
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,839
of those

1226
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,960
uh of those components effectively of

1227
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,520
those

1228
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,800
compartments um yeah so the

1229
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
then the reduction operator we're

1230
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,480
dropping the internal states because

1231
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,599
they're effective

1232
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,359
all of the information that you need to

1233
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,800
know about the internal states are

1234
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,520
already

1235
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,880
is already summarized in the blanket

1236
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,440
so you drop the internal states and you

1237
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
drop the fast stable modes of

1238
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,560
oscillation

1239
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,920
and that gets you from the uh

1240
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,960
the partitioned system

1241
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,560
back to uh a set of states at the next

1242
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,760
scale um so hopefully that

1243
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
explains what's going on but again the

1244
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,599
the that might sound very technical but

1245
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,720
the idea

1246
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
uh i think is pretty simple and it's

1247
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
just that we're constructing

1248
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,040
superordinate uh layers of the system

1249
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,880
from the slow modes of interaction

1250
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,200
of components at the subordinate scale

1251
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,760
very nice explanation maxwell really

1252
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,720
thanks a lot

1253
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,400
for that yeah super helpful so let's go

1254
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,760
over that because i think it's really

1255
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,160
critical and i think for some people

1256
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,880
it's like wait

1257
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,800
weren't they just talking about ecology

1258
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
so what just happened there how did we

1259
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,720
go from the big questions in ecology

1260
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,280
to this grouping operator loop that was

1261
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,480
just described

1262
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,040
and so the main pivot i think has to do

1263
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,720
with multi-scale systems

1264
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,240
and how we're going to be modeling

1265
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
across different scales

1266
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,040
and so what the question is is

1267
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,280
uh again thinking about understanding

1268
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,560
and modeling these dynamics of

1269
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,079
multi-scale systems

1270
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,240
and there's an unprincipled way and this

1271
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,319
is a principled not the only principled

1272
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,200
way but

1273
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
a principled way to do this multi-scale

1274
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,599
integration so an unprincipled way

1275
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,400
would be for example um you use method a

1276
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,319
to go from the fast dynamics to the next

1277
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,240
level so you have a heart cell simulator

1278
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,359
proprietary program heart cell sim 4 and

1279
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,160
then

1280
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,440
you make just another software pipeline

1281
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,119
that connects the outcome of that

1282
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,000
simulation to a model of the whole

1283
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,800
heart physiology and then you kind of

1284
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,359
run the

1285
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,480
the results from these two different

1286
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,720
models back and forth so maybe it works

1287
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,119
maybe

1288
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,800
it's functional so no one's saying it

1289
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640
isn't it's just that the way that those

1290
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,480
two pieces were joined together

1291
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,960
was a bit a priori it was a little bit

1292
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,079
just chosen

1293
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
and it would be better if there was a

1294
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,359
way that we could for example

1295
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,440
take measurements across levels and use

1296
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,200
information that they provide

1297
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,119
to constitute our better understanding

1298
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,240
of the whole system

1299
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,920
so not just throw away the model that

1300
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,520
went um

1301
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,440
information that doesn't fit into each

1302
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
little bottleneck of information

1303
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,720
but how can we have this full

1304
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,040
variational in the um like

1305
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,800
constituting variance across multiple

1306
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,319
time scale as well as

1307
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,800
variational from that physics side which

1308
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,520
brings along

1309
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
all these really positive benefits

1310
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,160
related to computability attractability

1311
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,520
and relationship with bayesian

1312
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,920
statistics and forney factor graphs and

1313
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,760
all these kind of cool areas it ends on

1314
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,319
bridging

1315
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,640
so if there's a hinge with multi-scale

1316
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,200
systems having a useful description

1317
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,280
then we're in the category of the

1318
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760
physics models like spin graphs and game

1319
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,640
of life

1320
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,280
and then also at higher levels at the

1321
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
very least the tools for dealing with

1322
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,400
the kinds of things

1323
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,079
that those kinds of simulations like the

1324
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
game of life were invented to describe

1325
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,440
so that's sort of the main key point and

1326
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,839
so

1327
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,000
this is what maxwell has run through and

1328
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,520
represented here

1329
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,760
is describing just like you could use

1330
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,440
model selection techniques

1331
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
to figure out which multi-level

1332
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,000
statistical regression model or

1333
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,400
which multiple anova was the most

1334
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,000
appropriate or whether to include an

1335
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
interaction term or not or a

1336
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,440
multi-um uh scale model from a bayesian

1337
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,160
framework

1338
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,920
whichever modeling framework you're

1339
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,680
working within hopefully there's a

1340
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,720
principled way

1341
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,040
to go about doing model selection and

1342
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,480
doing model comparison

1343
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
and so if i can just interject yes uh

1344
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,839
carl

1345
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,880
carl fristen um calls this the apart

1346
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,079
the particular partition and there's a

1347
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,680
there's a play on words here there's a

1348
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,920
double on the

1349
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,839
by particular partition he means

1350
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,760
partitioning the system into particles

1351
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,359
which are the internal states

1352
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,680
of a system plus the markov blanket but

1353
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,280
he also means it's a particular

1354
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,880
partition as in there are other ways of

1355
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,000
doing this

1356
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,319
uh there yeah there there's not

1357
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,119
necessarily

1358
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,559
one unique way of cutting things up

1359
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,440
uh and so the partition itself is named

1360
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
to reflect that fact i thought it was

1361
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,960
kind of fun to bring up

1362
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,520
yes now let me connect that point right

1363
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,079
there about

1364
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,319
one particular choice relating to

1365
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,240
dimensional reduction techniques and

1366
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,800
where

1367
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,400
uh degrees of freedom come into play for

1368
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,720
the experimenter so in real data sets

1369
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,359
you can do

1370
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,800
techniques like principal component

1371
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,400
analysis and you can do things like

1372
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,319
linear discriminant analysis which looks

1373
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,079
basically for group separation

1374
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,400
as an additive combination of principal

1375
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,119
components

1376
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,400
so it tries to explain the most

1377
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,880
variation with these orthogonal axes

1378
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,079
through the data that's principal

1379
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,440
components analysis

1380
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,680
now there's some data sets where the

1381
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,599
first principal component explains 80

1382
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,880
and the next one explains five percent

1383
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,880
of the variance and has a long tail

1384
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,960
now whether you need the first principal

1385
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,319
component and you're just going to take

1386
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,280
only the first one

1387
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,680
or whether you take 99 of the variance

1388
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,119
being explained by 500 principal

1389
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,160
components where the

1390
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,960
explainability of principal component 74

1391
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,559
on your netflix consumption doesn't

1392
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,079
really map to like a real world

1393
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,480
understandable trait it still can reduce

1394
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,160
your um uncertainty about a machine

1395
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,839
learning model but it doesn't like map

1396
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,000
onto something that's actual about the

1397
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
group anymore may be misaligned with all

1398
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,599
these other things

1399
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,079
those kinds of analyses are always up to

1400
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,599
the experimenter to decide

1401
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,280
how many dimensions they want to reduce

1402
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,800
to do you want to reduce

1403
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
down to a two-dimensional space just

1404
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,800
upon the data points in the principal

1405
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,119
component one principle component two

1406
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,520
just remap onto the two dimensions that

1407
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,440
explain the most variants linearly

1408
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,040
or do you want to map into a 500

1409
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
dimension space that's where a lot of

1410
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,160
the freedom comes into play

1411
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
so just like there's a particular

1412
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,200
principle component analysis is

1413
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,319
presented in a paper

1414
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,920
but principal component analysis is a

1415
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,640
general technique a particular system

1416
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,119
will have a particular decomposition

1417
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,200
statistically and in this way

1418
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,359
and that will also reflect degrees of or

1419
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,880
freedom in modeling it and in the

1420
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,760
statistics

1421
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
but the framework just like the anova

1422
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
framework goes a little bit beyond

1423
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,880
and isn't necessarily um about any

1424
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,400
specific system

1425
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,240
well one thing to point out is that

1426
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
there's a kind of recursivity at play

1427
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,960
where

1428
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,400
i mean what you can actually see

1429
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,319
what is the best way to partition the

1430
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,440
system just

1431
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,839
kind of recursively in that like what

1432
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,520
you can do is take your system and then

1433
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,000
write

1434
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,720
right alternative generative models of

1435
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,480
how you think the system

1436
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
is actually behaving and then you can

1437
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,880
use free energy as a metric to see which

1438
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,559
out of these alternative models of the

1439
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,559
system's structure is the one that best

1440
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,000
explains its behavior

1441
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,400
so there's a meta-bayesian kind of

1442
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,000
aspect to this where like

1443
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,040
we're we're not only just like modeling

1444
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,640
uh the system as if it were

1445
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,800
an active inference agent but we can use

1446
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,119
generative models to assess

1447
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,400
uh which out of the possible ways of

1448
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,680
cutting up the states

1449
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,000
of carving up the system is the most

1450
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,720
appropriate

1451
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,359
and again it's using the same metrics uh

1452
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,800
so model evidence

1453
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,599
it's always model evidence i had a call

1454
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,440
with uh carl yesterday and he was saying

1455
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,240
well you know

1456
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,760
whatever the question the answer is

1457
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,800
always multiple evidence

1458
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,559
let me connect that's one more niche

1459
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,559
idea so we talked about the skilled

1460
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,160
intentionality framework and how that's

1461
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,480
like

1462
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,000
part of you know the niche is the

1463
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,839
affordances and that can reflect a lot

1464
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:10,240
of

1465
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,079
aspects that are learned or that are

1466
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,440
cultural but

1467
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,680
the niche can also include mercury

1468
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,200
that's influencing you and you can't

1469
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,800
taste it or detect it but it's changing

1470
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,839
your phenotype or

1471
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,480
something like that so again maybe some

1472
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,599
niche concepts are more

1473
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,440
affordance oriented like the ecological

1474
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,800
psychology niche

1475
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,640
is more oriented towards action

1476
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,400
unsurprisingly however for many

1477
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,920
ecologists when you talk about the niche

1478
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,559
that means like

1479
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,720
how much light is hitting the ground

1480
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,400
what temperature is it at night

1481
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,480
so that is also reflected by the

1482
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,160
realized versus the fundamental niche

1483
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,359
because especially when you're talking

1484
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,119
about those abiotic factors

1485
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,559
you're sometimes talking about oh yeah

1486
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,480
rocks that you can knock over but a lot

1487
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,680
of times again people just think of

1488
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,359
rocks as being in the physical

1489
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,760
niche so things can influence and not be

1490
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,839
reflected by sensory states

1491
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,400
and then all we have is the model so you

1492
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,200
have the model

1493
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,359
of decision making it doesn't know that

1494
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,480
it's being

1495
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,839
slowly drifting off into a non-adaptive

1496
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,119
state space because of the

1497
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,520
cup that has led into it all it is

1498
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,720
experiencing

1499
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
reducing its uncertainty is about is its

1500
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,839
generative model

1501
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,400
of its niche and that's more on the

1502
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
ecological psychology side

1503
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,920
and that can even be extended to like a

1504
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,440
molecular level like chemicals that

1505
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,640
can't be tasted

1506
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,720
they can still influence you so it's not

1507
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,680
only about

1508
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,920
how the action is enabled in the world

1509
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,760
but that is the primacy

1510
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,599
when you're coming from an organism or a

1511
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,640
system of interest perspective

1512
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,640
and that's where you make this initial

1513
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,160
like what are the measurements to make

1514
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,680
like maxwell started off with

1515
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,599
you start with states those are

1516
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,200
measurements you could say

1517
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,880
we could measure this we could measure

1518
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,319
this thing over here we could do it over

1519
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:44,800
here

1520
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,000
but you got to start with at least the

1521
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,359
idea that measurements are going to be

1522
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,400
made

1523
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,359
or at least that there are certain

1524
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,800
distributions or types of measurements

1525
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,400
that could be made

1526
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,640
um one other thing with the grouping

1527
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,240
operator that you mentioned

1528
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,839
that kind of reminded me of click

1529
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,960
detection of conditional independencies

1530
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,359
and so the the other way of saying that

1531
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,559
is click detection of

1532
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,040
the conditional dependencies because in

1533
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,800
order to find out which ones are zeros

1534
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,000
you got to find out which ones are

1535
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
nonzero and then when you think about

1536
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,240
there's this representation

1537
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,559
ability to transform between the matrix

1538
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,280
and the network

1539
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,119
like through the adjacency matrix or

1540
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,319
more advanced relation

1541
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,280
related matrices then you can do click

1542
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,920
detection

1543
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,319
on a matrix so matrix is going to be

1544
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,040
able to make

1545
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,839
a network that has the exact same data

1546
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,319
in it

1547
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,240
whether it's just one zero like edges or

1548
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,680
not edges or whether it's a weighted

1549
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,200
edge or a different type of edge

1550
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,559
there's such an equivalence between

1551
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,000
matrices and networks that click

1552
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,640
detection

1553
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,559
on a social network or something like

1554
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,720
that is going to be also detectable on

1555
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,680
the matrix form

1556
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,200
so that's something to keep in mind when

1557
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,559
we're talking about like a matrix coming

1558
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,079
in here but then there's like maybe a

1559
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,440
network of interactions coming out

1560
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,000
another side

1561
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,119
okay any thoughts or questions

1562
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,119
that was definitely worth explaining

1563
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,040
maybe we could now return to six

1564
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,559
or we could also go to four where

1565
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,319
there's a few questions from previous

1566
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,280
i really wouldn't necessarily go sick

1567
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,160
honestly

1568
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,440
uh it's like the most technical slide

1569
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
like in in our papers sounds good

1570
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,520
so i mean like unless unless the really

1571
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,400
nitty

1572
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,800
nitty nitty nitty gritty gritty gritty

1573
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,000
gritty detail

1574
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,160
is of interest i would just uh i would

1575
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,200
suggest that

1576
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,160
we not and i think figure three captures

1577
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,520
everything conceptually

1578
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,680
uh the figure six really just tells you

1579
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,079
how you add states to every particular

1580
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,440
thing so it's just running through the

1581
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,880
same thing but like okay we're taking

1582
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,680
this state

1583
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,040
and now what do we do with it uh so

1584
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,760
yeah we'll do 7.3 late night maybe if we

1585
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,480
need to

1586
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,040
but for now i think let's just return to

1587
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,240
figure four

1588
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,839
which we've actually seen in previous

1589
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,640
weeks and

1590
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,280
i just wrote down a few questions one

1591
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,079
was

1592
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,680
i believe alejandra's question from

1593
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,359
several weeks ago about

1594
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,040
what are some differences between

1595
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,880
simulating systems like

1596
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,799
those that can at least apparently

1597
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,799
engage in deep counterfactuals

1598
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,040
and morphological systems and so the

1599
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,480
question arose like okay but is the cell

1600
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,280
really doing

1601
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,160
a counterfactual analysis of alternate

1602
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,920
cell shapes it could be

1603
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,520
in a way that the brain may be doing

1604
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,119
some type of modeling of what

1605
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,359
behavioral states could be and then so

1606
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,799
that's the previous question that we're

1607
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:23,920
definitely going to return to

1608
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,559
hear new perspectives on from anyone who

1609
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,760
wants to raise their hand

1610
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,480
and then the second set of questions is

1611
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,280
cool

1612
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,040
where does evolution fit into all of

1613
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,640
this and so

1614
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,319
a little bit more broadly how does this

1615
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,640
bayesian perspective play into evolution

1616
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,280
ecology

1617
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,440
development and learning because this is

1618
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,799
a morphogenesis

1619
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,760
problem it's a devo problem and we know

1620
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,480
that eco

1621
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
and evo are going to come into play with

1622
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,760
devo so

1623
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,160
how do we think about all these levels

1624
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,799
and how does

1625
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,480
figure four make its appearance in this

1626
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,000
paper what what is it relevant what does

1627
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,119
it show

1628
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,400
so any

1629
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
thought i think that is just about how

1630
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,680
morphogenesis and in general higher

1631
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,119
order pattern formation

1632
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,319
happens under the variational framework

1633
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,240
uh so i mean we've discussed this in

1634
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,319
previous episodes but

1635
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,440
the idea is always essentially the same

1636
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,839
it's that uh so what is it to share a

1637
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:20,880
generative model

1638
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,559
well in the context of active inference

1639
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,720
to share a generative model means that

1640
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,760
you share the same beliefs about

1641
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,359
the kinds of sensory consequences

1642
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,079
that follow you know the effects of

1643
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,079
states in the world and in particular

1644
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,359
the effects of

1645
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,799
my own actions in the world

1646
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,559
so the idea is that if we share a

1647
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,720
generative model we expect

1648
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,240
to perceive the world in the same way

1649
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,559
as a consequence of the same kinds of

1650
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:51,760
things

1651
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,040
so uh pursue pursuing on that idea

1652
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,599
if we have the same generative model

1653
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,839
then if i just do my thing

1654
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,920
and you just do your thing we're

1655
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,680
eventually going to end up

1656
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,640
zeroing in on the same overall pattern

1657
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,559
because we share the same expectations

1658
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,000
about the kinds of things that we should

1659
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,680
expect conditions on the same kinds of

1660
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,480
states

1661
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,880
so if if you have a system that's

1662
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,160
equipped with like

1663
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,920
state or yeah state dependent

1664
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,720
observation profiles so for example if

1665
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,680
i'm a heart cell

1666
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,839
i should expect to sense other heart

1667
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:26,799
cells and to

1668
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,480
you know register blood flow and

1669
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,000
whatever

1670
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,599
whereas if i'm a brain cell then i

1671
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,599
really shouldn't be registering blood

1672
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,400
or other heart cells at all so if you

1673
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,599
have these kinds of

1674
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,480
state-dependent observation uh

1675
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,920
distributions

1676
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,240
uh then you can start to see how sharing

1677
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,400
a generative model would allow

1678
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,520
for a bunch of components to zero in on

1679
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,599
uh well first of all on a target

1680
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,359
configuration and second of all

1681
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,599
kind of settle into a mutually coherent

1682
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,839
pattern of inference about what is my

1683
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,839
role in these higher order

1684
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,359
uh patterns that i'm part of

1685
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,400
um yeah and so the the idea there i

1686
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,720
guess

1687
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,839
is the so this is the hor the vertical

1688
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,240
stack idea that we discussed uh last

1689
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,280
last week uh this the variational

1690
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,440
ecology is a horizontal and a vertical

1691
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,240
story

1692
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,400
a vertical and a horizontal story it's a

1693
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,079
vertical story in that you have nested

1694
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,160
systems of systems of systems of systems

1695
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,960
which is what i

1696
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,520
tend to emphasize in a lot of my work

1697
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,720
but at every

1698
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,520
basically in between every two scales

1699
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,799
there's a niche construction story where

1700
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,240
uh you know the the the body at large is

1701
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,160
a niche for the organs the organs at

1702
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,839
large are a niche for the cells

1703
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,640
and so on

1704
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,920
thanks i'm gonna address the evolution

1705
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,440
side and then return to

1706
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,119
this idea that maxwell was just talking

1707
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,400
about about shared generative models

1708
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,160
because that was also very helpful

1709
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,480
so how does evolution play into this

1710
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,720
well let's imagine this morphogenesis

1711
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,319
creature that we're watching

1712
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,240
okay it turns out that there's a lot of

1713
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,920
parameters in this model that are

1714
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,200
detailed in the paper but

1715
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,280
it's not like all parameter combinations

1716
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,440
lead to the solution on the bottom right

1717
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,599
only specific priors and specific

1718
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,359
mapping relationships between sensory

1719
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,480
and action states

1720
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,040
will result in this exact kind of um

1721
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,920
light bulb

1722
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,000
shaped creature okay you can imagine

1723
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,119
there's some arrangement that might

1724
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,319
result in a circle there's some

1725
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,520
arrangement it might

1726
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,280
the state space is large and it might

1727
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,720
not fix upon a stable

1728
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,119
point or it might do it very rapidly

1729
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,480
what cuts through

1730
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,920
all of these models what does model

1731
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,680
selection evolution

1732
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,599
if it turns out that the wind is blowing

1733
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,960
from the north to the south

1734
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,680
in this image and that this shape it has

1735
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,839
worked in the past and it left more

1736
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,000
uh you know offspring that believed that

1737
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,839
that shape was the morphogenesis

1738
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,400
um position to approach you'll just see

1739
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,599
that around it doesn't mean it's the

1740
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:52,799
only solution

1741
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,200
it just means it is what has existed so

1742
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,040
this is sort of an ab initio

1743
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,839
or a computational simulation of an

1744
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,280
artificial situation

1745
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,240
obviously but in the realized world

1746
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,799
where

1747
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,200
creatures are evolving then you find

1748
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,720
that only the organisms that have the

1749
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,480
phenotypes that adequately reflect

1750
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,760
regularities their niche

1751
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,920
are going to be left carrying forward

1752
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,280
and so it's kind of like

1753
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,040
wow how do the ants know to drag back

1754
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,040
this fly from 30 meters in the desert

1755
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,520
it's like

1756
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,200
it's all they do it's all they've been

1757
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,799
doing if they couldn't do it

1758
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,000
they'd be doing something else or they

1759
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,920
wouldn't exist it's not like you'd see

1760
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,599
an aunt just struggling and failing to

1761
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:28,240
do it

1762
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,839
that would be a very short-lived

1763
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,680
strategy so there's wacky stuff that

1764
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,480
happens

1765
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,079
again when the niche is transiently

1766
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,760
misaligned with evolutionary

1767
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,480
priors or when an evolutionary prior

1768
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,079
tends towards just like accept

1769
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,359
everything into the nest you know pull

1770
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,040
in threads or something like that but i

1771
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,160
think that's really important to keep in

1772
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,280
mind that evolution

1773
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,760
often does model selection for us to

1774
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,799
actually find

1775
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,920
the solutions that work bottom right and

1776
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,040
the expectation action relationships

1777
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,599
top left that relate in morphogenesis

1778
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:58,640
top right

1779
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,640
through the extracellular target signal

1780
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,319
being the coordinating mechanism in this

1781
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,520
morphogenesis example

1782
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,280
on the bottom that's development

1783
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,680
mediated what appears to be by this

1784
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,599
basically monotonic decrease in free

1785
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,160
energy representing the utility of

1786
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,720
modeling this system in converting to or

1787
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,240
converging towards a developmental

1788
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,040
attractor

1789
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,520
using a free energy framework well

1790
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,599
notice that it spikes initially which is

1791
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,480
interesting

1792
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,960
so all the agents are kind of trying to

1793
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,680
figure out

1794
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,760
what their position is and then they

1795
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,240
settle into like a mutually consistent

1796
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,680
uh group inference um and you know this

1797
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,359
work has been recapitulated across

1798
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,440
several scales uh

1799
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,920
enser palacios and colleagues have a

1800
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,280
cool paper where they do

1801
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,000
this across three scales so they they

1802
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,040
have like a micro

1803
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,760
meso and a macro scale all premised on

1804
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,599
the same free energy functional

1805
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,920
and you get these nice layers of like

1806
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,760
organelles within organs within an

1807
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,599
organism

1808
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,079
cool and let me also go back to one

1809
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,200
thing you said about the shared

1810
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,559
generative model so you talked about

1811
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,200
like the

1812
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,359
neurons sort of being in their niche you

1813
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,359
know wrapped in a specific type of glia

1814
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,880
or receiving certain types of

1815
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,160
communication at different

1816
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,839
developmental time periods from

1817
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,599
different inputs um

1818
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,240
there's almost this um not a complete

1819
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,839
replacement that you can do of

1820
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,680
having a share generative model as you

1821
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,880
mentioned between the cells but it's

1822
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,359
like

1823
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,960
they're part of a shared generative

1824
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,720
model at a higher level

1825
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,200
like through the neurons own

1826
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,079
expectations

1827
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,760
and its own niche it subsumes and it

1828
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,400
becomes

1829
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,119
a functional part of a larger generative

1830
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,960
model brains know things that neurons

1831
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,680
don't

1832
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,319
and so that is very naturally

1833
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,960
accommodated in a multi-scale framework

1834
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,280
because at the level of analyzing just

1835
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,400
the two cells

1836
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,000
you'd find that they act as if they had

1837
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,599
a shared generative model

1838
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,039
and so it would make sense oh at the

1839
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,799
level of the social interaction it's

1840
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,559
like two people are having shared gender

1841
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,680
models like they both know how the

1842
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,119
movie's going to play out or they both

1843
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,880
know whose turn it is to speak

1844
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,599
but then at a higher level and that's

1845
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,359
all happening at the same time

1846
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,520
it's also like being part of a shared

1847
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,720
generative model

1848
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,680
that is the higher level whether that's

1849
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,680
thought of as collective computation or

1850
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,119
collective cognition or

1851
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,200
distributed intelligence whatever

1852
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,280
framework it ends up playing out as

1853
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,200
the brain knows things that the neuron

1854
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,920
doesn't and so the social group

1855
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,799
is having dynamics that constrain and

1856
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,880
facilitate the individual level

1857
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,359
in a way that specifically will evade

1858
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,440
the computation or the understanding

1859
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,400
of the individual so i think that's kind

1860
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,720
of

1861
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,520
an interesting consequence of this and

1862
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,559
yeah

1863
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,039
good i mean yeah to address a question

1864
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:39,920
that

1865
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,839
was asked initially about shared

1866
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,480
intentionality um

1867
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,520
i mean so we have this paper now out in

1868
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,400
entropy

1869
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,880
uh where we we basically argue that the

1870
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,200
free energy principle provides a formal

1871
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,640
semantics

1872
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,280
and by that we mean that so what it is

1873
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,000
really to act

1874
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,640
on a generative model is to have an

1875
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,240
intentional relation

1876
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,280
with uh some features of

1877
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,799
an environment that you're inferring

1878
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,039
constantly uh

1879
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,799
i mean that that's effectively what

1880
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,079
having a generative model

1881
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,079
allows you to do it allows you to go

1882
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,359
from your sensory data

1883
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,280
and from your architecture of priors and

1884
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,400
likelihoods to

1885
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,160
an estimation of what most likely caused

1886
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,960
your sensory data and you know

1887
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,400
intentionality

1888
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,960
kind of seems to come pre-packaged with

1889
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,400
that as in like you know

1890
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,880
if intentionality means being uh

1891
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,280
appropriately receptive

1892
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,079
uh or to you know features of an

1893
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,079
environment that stimulate you

1894
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,319
well then having a generative model just

1895
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,039
means being intentional in that sense

1896
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,920
and sharing a generative model it means

1897
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,559
that you

1898
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,480
you're participating in a form of shared

1899
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,839
intentionality so

1900
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,039
a shared way of systematically you know

1901
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,920
relating

1902
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,799
uh your observations and embodied priors

1903
01:04:58,799 --> 01:04:59,680
to

1904
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,880
um like patterns of behavior

1905
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,079
and so on cool

1906
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,160
one other thought and this was something

1907
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,200
that our friend

1908
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,680
blue was talking about at our event a

1909
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,720
couple weeks ago

1910
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,440
was this multi-scale agency concept so

1911
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,319
the individual

1912
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,119
agency concept a relational edge agency

1913
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,160
then the small group

1914
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,119
and then the community and so we can't

1915
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,039
necessarily directly experience

1916
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,000
but what can you tell somebody to

1917
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,280
participate in

1918
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,920
at the local level that does engender

1919
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,079
this higher order adaptive

1920
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,480
process to play out and so i think it's

1921
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,400
the space between

1922
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,000
having a shared generative model and

1923
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,599
being a shared generative model

1924
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,920
like we're going to have shared norms so

1925
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,960
that we're going to

1926
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,599
take cognitive diversity and help that

1927
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,280
map our search space for the critical

1928
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,200
problems that influence us all

1929
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,359
so we'll have the best search and we'll

1930
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,960
figure out the outcomes that

1931
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,880
are going to be reflecting this kind of

1932
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,480
a distribution that we want to converge

1933
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,280
toward

1934
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,200
that's the kind of well specified

1935
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,039
harnessing of differences

1936
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,200
within the niche because you you said

1937
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,400
maxwell um

1938
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,839
agents that see the world in the same

1939
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,240
way so i i know that you didn't mean

1940
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,599
that from the overlapping because

1941
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,880
literally no one's you know generative

1942
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,319
visual model is going to be the exact

1943
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:14,960
same

1944
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,839
but there's this question of how much

1945
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:18,799
seeing the same way

1946
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,039
versus basically the variation within

1947
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,960
the niche in the exact same way right of

1948
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,839
course not but it's

1949
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,920
it's a goldilocks situation because if

1950
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,839
everyone had exactly the same predictive

1951
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,640
model

1952
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,640
then we would never see literally

1953
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,880
differences in opinions or ideas

1954
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,039
and so when thinking about the heterodox

1955
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,160
or the novel

1956
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,559
or the informative the adaptive that

1957
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,960
space is really about the mapping of the

1958
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,480
individual

1959
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,920
you know uh action perception loops in a

1960
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,640
sense

1961
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,039
onto this collective level and there's

1962
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,119
uh individual states that can be healthy

1963
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,359
in one context and and unhealthy or

1964
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,599
considered unhealthy in another context

1965
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,760
and so it's just i think it's just the

1966
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,440
beginning of

1967
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,119
thinking about multi-scale systems from

1968
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,119
this way but then

1969
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,960
as we know people's concept about

1970
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,640
themselves and their

1971
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,200
social world changes their behavior and

1972
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,720
in ways that are really

1973
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,160
subtle kind of what is water so just

1974
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,440
very interesting stuff

1975
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,559
cool any other thoughts on this figure

1976
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:27,760
so just to go through the figures in

1977
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,599
reverse order we had six which will

1978
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,599
again it's a late night spooky special

1979
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,280
for another time

1980
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,480
five any thoughts on five also looks

1981
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,160
like there's a lot of uh

1982
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,880
equations on there not needing to unpack

1983
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,839
now

1984
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,200
four talked about three and then i mean

1985
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,000
yeah

1986
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,240
five and six for those of you who really

1987
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,839
want to drill into the

1988
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,079
i mean we could have like a a 7.3 or

1989
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,280
something at some point

1990
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,680
uh ideally with a few of the more like

1991
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,760
technical people to really unpack that

1992
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,720
because five and six like really unpack

1993
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,079
the math

1994
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,240
uh in some detail but i i don't know how

1995
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,160
useful it is for like a high-level

1996
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,280
conceptual discus

1997
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,799
discussion like we're having right now

1998
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
so perfect yep

1999
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,719
totally agree and sounds good about that

2000
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,279
yep well those were the figures does

2001
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,040
anyone else want to return to

2002
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,880
any slide or want to bring up any other

2003
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,238
thoughts or questions like what was

2004
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,000
something that was interesting

2005
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,560
that they heard about or something that

2006
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,238
they didn't expect for the discussion

2007
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,880
to introduce or another direction that

2008
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,238
they would like to see it go

2009
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,639
towards

2010
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,479
well early on there were some remarks

2011
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,920
about theory of mind and so on

2012
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,080
yeah so we have a whole paper on this

2013
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,960
that came out

2014
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,719
actually it came out in behavioral and

2015
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,560
brain sciences so we're very proud of

2016
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,439
that

2017
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,120
um it's called thinking through other

2018
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,719
minds and

2019
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,479
yeah it's it's basically like well it

2020
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,080
was a target article and there were like

2021
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,479
27 or 28 tier commentaries and we wrote

2022
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:05,679
a response

2023
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,839
and so if you're interested in how this

2024
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,479
fits in with theory of mind

2025
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,560
and you know the the debates between

2026
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,759
simulation theory

2027
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,839
and theory theory and all that well we

2028
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:16,880
have like a paper

2029
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,719
length uh treatment of that

2030
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,319
um yeah and the i think the

2031
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,040
the kind of in a nutshell response is

2032
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,520
that

2033
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,080
well you can you can both you can have

2034
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,198
your cake and eat it too

2035
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,960
using the variational framework i mean

2036
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,158
you might have noticed that this is sort

2037
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:34,719
of our

2038
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,960
argumentative strategy is often to say

2039
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,319
well there seems to be this split in the

2040
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,198
literature

2041
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,960
and actually both sides of the split can

2042
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,319
be made sense of

2043
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,640
and done justice too by appealing to

2044
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,719
this active inference framework

2045
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,679
and here as well i mean we we kind of

2046
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,600
strike a balance between these kind of

2047
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,719
explicit

2048
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,239
theory theory mind reading uh accounts

2049
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,679
and these more implicit kind of

2050
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:58,960
simulation theory

2051
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,120
embodied resonance kind of approaches

2052
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,199
again by appealing to our multi-scale

2053
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,159
story right

2054
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,960
so i mean you know you have uh more

2055
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,040
explicit and more implicit

2056
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,920
forms of inference about others and uh

2057
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,320
the more explicit they become the more

2058
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,400
like the more properly you're heading

2059
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,800
into theory of mind territory

2060
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,880
um but i mean that that could also be a

2061
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,800
topic for discussion that'll in a later

2062
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,520
podcast

2063
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,360
uh but there's there's a whole paper

2064
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,880
length treatment though it was my point

2065
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,440
if

2066
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,840
it's of interest anyway super cool i'll

2067
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,360
check it out

2068
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,560
cool yeah i think that it will be really

2069
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,840
good for the next

2070
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,080
two months last two months of 2020

2071
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,600
that's eight weeks

2072
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,360
so we'll have four papers the ones that

2073
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,719
we laid out

2074
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,920
we'll cover a few a few uh

2075
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,400
old stomping grounds and a few new areas

2076
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,280
as well

2077
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,760
for eight we'll be going into math a lot

2078
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,800
more

2079
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,520
and i think in some other social domains

2080
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,440
maybe with the scripts paper

2081
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,280
and yeah i'm just like looking forward

2082
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,679
to these conversations

2083
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,360
making our queue of papers for 2021

2084
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,440
having special events if there's anyone

2085
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,640
who wants to

2086
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,360
arrange for like a special interview or

2087
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:13,760
a

2088
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,000
session modeling like a mod like a

2089
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,360
simulation

2090
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,040
approach these could all be kind of fun

2091
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,679
types of discussions to have because

2092
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,760
it's fun to bring in all these different

2093
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,120
angles on it

2094
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,600
hear from the medical and hear from the

2095
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,320
practitioners

2096
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,120
yeah awesome thank you so much again for

2097
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,840
the

2098
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,960
the really nice uh treatment that

2099
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,239
this uh podcast gives to our work uh

2100
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,800
my gratitude is overflowing uh i hope

2101
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,600
you can

2102
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,520
good yeah these really is unpack and

2103
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,280
they help a lot and this is what the

2104
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,280
game is about just understanding and

2105
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,239
learning and

2106
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,440
turning it over hearing in different

2107
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,159
ways so thanks for participating

2108
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,360
i guess this is 7.2 but next time in 8 9

2109
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:03,679
10

2110
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,239
11 for the rest of 2020 we'll we'll

2111
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,360
finish out strong

2112
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,600
with more learning and more exploring

2113
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,760
areas that are new to everyone

2114
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,440
so send us any comments or questions

2115
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,840
that you have that we can unpack live

2116
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,080
the follow-up form is in the calendar

2117
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,400
invite so if anyone wants to provide any

2118
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,480
feedback there that'd be cool

2119
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,920
and just uh stay in touch this has been

2120
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,840
a great team com so thanks so much

2121
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,600
everyone for participating

2122
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,960
very cool take care yep peace

2123
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,880
thanks a lot
