"00;00;12;01","00;00;12;17","All right."
"00;00;12;26","00;00;14;05","Greetings, everyone."
"00;00;14;05","00;00;18;07","Welcome to Active LabLive stream number 23.2."
"00;00;18;21","00;00;21;14","Today's June 15th 2021."
"00;00;21;27","00;00;25;05","And we're going to be havingour two discussion"
"00;00;25;06","00;00;28;26","on embodied skillful performancewhere the action is."
"00;00;29;13","00;00;32;03","And we'll see who else joins us live"
"00;00;32;03","00;00;35;11","as we go through the slides in the paper."
"00;00;35;23","00;00;38;24","And also, of course,if you're watching live, we'd"
"00;00;38;24","00;00;41;01","welcome any questions or comments."
"00;00;42;15","00;00;44;26","Welcome to the Active Inference Lab,everyone."
"00;00;45;14","00;00;49;14","We are a participatory online labthat is communicating,"
"00;00;49;14","00;00;52;15","learning and practicingapplied active inference."
"00;00;52;25","00;00;55;20","You can find us at the linksthat are on this slide."
"00;00;56;14","00;00;57;27","This is recorded."
"00;00;57;27","00;00;59;10","Greetings, Dave."
"00;00;59;16","00;01;01;27","This is a recorded and an archivedlive stream,"
"00;01;02;05","00;01;05;05","so please provide us with feedbackso that we can improve our work."
"00;01;05;28","00;01;08;25","All backgroundsand perspectives are welcome here"
"00;01;09;05","00;01;12;19","and we'll be followinggood video etiquette for live streams."
"00;01;14;09","00;01;15;03","We're"
"00;01;15;03","00;01;18;24","again on June 15th,having our second group discussion"
"00;01;18;24","00;01;21;27","on embodied skillful performancewhere the action is."
"00;01;22;07","00;01;25;05","So this is sort of our jumping off pointand let's"
"00;01;25;05","00;01;28;22","see if we can make it a skillfulone today."
"00;01;28;22","00;01;32;08","The goals are reallyjust to be discussing and learning,"
"00;01;32;08","00;01;37;06","to be hearing the questions and pointsthat people found really interesting"
"00;01;37;06","00;01;39;11","when they were reading the paper,as well as"
"00;01;39;11","00;01;43;04","see where our discussioncan spontaneously go."
"00;01;43;04","00;01;46;16","As of course, participants join and leave"
"00;01;46;28","00;01;49;19","and hopefully we get some fun questionsfrom the chat"
"00;01;50;24","00;01;55;00","and we're just going to walkthrough the paper and the slides"
"00;01;55;01","00;01;59;18","go where we need to goto hopefully connect some dots."
"00;02;00;11","00;02;05;15","So with that being said, let'sjust go to the introductions and warm ups"
"00;02;05;26","00;02;10;15","and we can each just give an introductorythought on the paper"
"00;02;10;15","00;02;14;19","if we would like or something we likedor remembered something we're looking"
"00;02;14;19","00;02;20;07","to resolve, reduce our uncertaintyon by the end of the discussion. So"
"00;02;20;07","00;02;25;24","I'm Daniel and a postdoctoral researcherin Calif, and I'll pass to Dean."
"00;02;27;14","00;02;28;02","Hi, I'm Dean."
"00;02;28;02","00;02;32;03","I'm in Calgary and I'm coming"
"00;02;32;06","00;02;34;12","at a more embedded"
"00;02;35;04","00;02;37;16","personality in this active inference lab"
"00;02;38;16","00;02;41;28","world and I'll pass it over to Stephen."
"00;02;41;28","00;02;44;15","Hello, I'm Steven I'm based in Toronto."
"00;02;45;03","00;02;47;27","I'm doing a practice based PhDthrough the UK."
"00;02;47;28","00;02;49;25","I'm interested in"
"00;02;50;05","00;02;54;06","participatory theater, communitydevelopment and ways to understand"
"00;02;54;17","00;02;58;14","how people interact with each otherin groups and individually."
"00;02;58;14","00;03;02;24","So this paper is quite relevantas it opens up some new avenues in that"
"00;03;03;11","00;03;07;27","and I will pass it over to isit is Dave here?"
"00;03;07;27","00;03;10;03","Dave Hello? Dave."
"00;03;10;03","00;03;14;05","Yeah, Dave,if you can speak otherwise, no worries."
"00;03;14;05","00;03;16;19","Maybe you're just listening in."
"00;03;16;19","00;03;19;07","So maybe just a quick question."
"00;03;19;07","00;03;23;21","Stephen, where do we see the connectionbetween skillful performance,"
"00;03;23;21","00;03;28;10","which is oftenthought of like motor and bodily?"
"00;03;28;27","00;03;31;17","How do we connect thatto social practices"
"00;03;31;17","00;03;36;27","which are among bodies and useverbal behavior or symbolic behavior?"
"00;03;38;01","00;03;39;00","Yeah, I mean,"
"00;03;39;00","00;03;42;21","this is this is kind of a questionI think that's arising more and more as"
"00;03;42;21","00;03;46;10","people are trying to question psychologyor community psychology,"
"00;03;46;10","00;03;48;13","which works on the individual"
"00;03;48;13","00;03;51;15","or sociology which works on thissort of mass of people."
"00;03;51;28","00;03;56;06","But when you want to work with intosubjectivity and sort of small groups"
"00;03;56;18","00;03;59;08","and understanding the dynamicsthat are going on there,"
"00;04;01;01","00;04;02;23","you kind of ask"
"00;04;02;23","00;04;07;00","phenomenological questionsabout what it's like to be in that state,"
"00;04;07;09","00;04;10;24","which is kind of a bit more directthan, say,"
"00;04;10;28","00;04;14;17","some of psychological perspective on it,but it's still not quite working."
"00;04;14;18","00;04;16;28","So then you say,well, let's go into action here."
"00;04;16;28","00;04;20;07","Let's get into what's actually happeningin and among people"
"00;04;22;02","00;04;23;07","and often if you"
"00;04;23;07","00;04;26;10","then jump into action,that's another abstract area."
"00;04;26;10","00;04;28;15","But if you're in the area of practice,"
"00;04;30;13","00;04;33;03","you're kind of in in between."
"00;04;33;03","00;04;35;04","You know, it'ssomething that people are doing,"
"00;04;35;14","00;04;37;21","something that people are doingbetween each other."
"00;04;38;00","00;04;40;25","And but you're still able to talk about"
"00;04;40;25","00;04;43;18","how it's happening, how it feels."
"00;04;44;16","00;04;47;00","So I think that, that"
"00;04;47;24","00;04;50;03","this, this question of practicethen, you know,"
"00;04;50;05","00;04;53;05","takes you into the sort of areasthat get used a lot in arts,"
"00;04;53;05","00;04;57;02","arts, practice, theater practice,all these types of areas."
"00;04;57;02","00;05;00;13","So I think it's kind of a"
"00;05;00;13","00;05;03;12","nice nexusthat's normally a bit impenetrable."
"00;05;04;17","00;05;07;03","Or it makes me wonder,"
"00;05;07;09","00;05;12;10","do groups have skill or is skillsomething that only bodies have?"
"00;05;12;22","00;05;16;04","So you see some football teamor basketball team"
"00;05;16;12","00;05;20;07","do some very coordinatedplay or two dancers that are improvising"
"00;05;20;19","00;05;23;25","is that able to be reduced entirely"
"00;05;24;06","00;05;28;09","to the skills embodiedperformance of individual bodies,"
"00;05;28;21","00;05;32;05","or is there a wayin which we could talk about a group"
"00;05;32;05","00;05;36;29","embodying skillful performance,especially because so many performances"
"00;05;36;29","00;05;40;24","I mean, except for what stand up comedy,a few other things there a group,"
"00;05;40;24","00;05;44;10","and then even those individualperformances are in feedback."
"00;05;44;10","00;05;47;21","Sometimes with a group,it's just different roles"
"00;05;49;10","00;05;51;22","oh. That's a good point actually."
"00;05;51;22","00;05;54;11","I mean,I think that's really the exciting"
"00;05;54;27","00;05;58;06","field of practice that's going to begrowing over the next while."
"00;05;58;06","00;06;03;03","And I sense that it's almost impossibleto get that from a snapshot."
"00;06;03;27","00;06;07;21","You have to have somethingthat's progressing over time to get old."
"00;06;07;23","00;06;11;13","Let's just say I don't knowwhether that's true, but I sense"
"00;06;11;13","00;06;15;01","that there's more use in understandinghow things change over time"
"00;06;15;10","00;06;18;17","and getting the dynamics than thereis trying to analyze a snapshot."
"00;06;22;20","00;06;24;29","Dave,if you have any comments, you can unmute"
"00;06;24;29","00;06;29;12","and I'll see it or dinany sort of just opening thoughts."
"00;06;29;28","00;06;32;04","How does this start to meet you today?"
"00;06;35;03","00;06;38;19","But I'm going to come at itfrom a little different angle. I"
"00;06;40;10","00;06;43;04","so I think that we're between is a huge"
"00;06;43;21","00;06;48;13","it's the thing that that befuddles usand yet it's the thing that we"
"00;06;49;12","00;06;52;02","probably want to know the most about"
"00;06;52;23","00;06;57;09","and in this idea of embodying skillful,"
"00;06;57;20","00;07;00;29","skillful performance,I was going to actually ask"
"00;07;02;02","00;07;04;01","the author some questions around"
"00;07;04;01","00;07;06;22","how she relates it back to sort of the"
"00;07;07;05","00;07;11;05","the parts of the brainthat resolve these problems."
"00;07;11;05","00;07;15;26","So is it a spatial relationship thing,like what the hippocampus tends"
"00;07;15;26","00;07;21;01","to provide us some insight on, or is it acaudate nucleus thing which says that"
"00;07;21;19","00;07;26;08","we sequence everything out, we turn left,we turn right, we release the ball."
"00;07;26;28","00;07;30;23","And I was just curious about whichbecause those two things work,"
"00;07;31;03","00;07;35;02","but when one is on the other one is off,there's kind of a binary relationship"
"00;07;35;17","00;07;36;29","between those two parts of the brain."
"00;07;36;29","00;07;41;12","And so I wanted to kind of figure outhow that that toggling back"
"00;07;41;12","00;07;46;14","and forth is part of thisskill that we are witnessing"
"00;07;49;25","00;07;51;17","Nice point."
"00;07;51;17","00;07;55;09","There'sthe more cognitively driven versus"
"00;07;55;09","00;07;58;01","almost the more bodily driven"
"00;07;58;11","00;08;01;13","and then that handoff is where we see"
"00;08;01;28","00;08;04;24","skillful performanceand that's where we see choking."
"00;08;04;24","00;08;06;14","It's where we see all these dynamics"
"00;08;06;14","00;08;09;25","between cognitive processes and actionprocesses."
"00;08;10;11","00;08;11;29","OK, we see another Dave."
"00;08;11;29","00;08;16;12","Dave, if you can, if you want to give anythoughts, just feel free."
"00;08;17;14","00;08;19;16","Yeah, I'll just listen again. Thanks."
"00;08;19;16","00;08;21;10","Nice. Right on."
"00;08;21;10","00;08;24;13","That's the realthat's the real OG way to listen in"
"00;08;24;17","00;08;26;19","in the gypsyrather than in the live stream."
"00;08;29;00","00;08;29;18","Yeah."
"00;08;29;29","00;08;33;00","So we'll see who else joins in today."
"00;08;33;00","00;08;35;16","But that's a great questionabout the brain pieces."
"00;08;35;16","00;08;38;26","And then I alwaysthink about other species,"
"00;08;38;26","00;08;44;00","like if insects can have embodied actionand that seems pretty fair to say,"
"00;08;44;09","00;08;47;26","can they have skillful actionand how would we know?"
"00;08;48;09","00;08;50;00","And then if they do,"
"00;08;50;00","00;08;53;13","the layout of their brainand body is so different"
"00;08;53;13","00;08;56;03","that it would map on, you know,they don't have a hippocampus,"
"00;08;56;03","00;08;59;11","they don't have a prefrontal cortex,they have other brain regions."
"00;08;59;28","00;09;04;07","So we don't need to get too lockedinto one implementation"
"00;09;04;21","00;09;09;08","of these processes based upon humanneuroanatomy when we know that there's"
"00;09;09;08","00;09;14;22","other neuro anatomiesthat can deploy similar processes."
"00;09;15;02","00;09;20;04","So it helps us keep an open mindto the multiple realizations"
"00;09;20;14","00;09;23;24","of active inferenceor of embodied skillful performance"
"00;09;23;24","00;09;26;17","because of just the diversityof evolutionary systems."
"00;09;28;23","00;09;31;24","Let's take it overview at the roadmap."
"00;09;32;26","00;09;35;17","This paper has a form"
"00;09;35;17","00;09;37;29","that we've seen several times before,"
"00;09;38;18","00;09;41;20","which is in the first half"
"00;09;41;20","00;09;46;01","taking some nonactive inference body of research"
"00;09;46;12","00;09;49;18","so in this case it's skillful performance"
"00;09;50;04","00;09;52;06","and optimal motor control theory"
"00;09;52;25","00;09;55;20","and investigating with a critical lens."
"00;09;55;20","00;10;00;01","This previous body of researchto understand what does it really say"
"00;10;00;01","00;10;01;07","or what are the assumptions."
"00;10;01;07","00;10;04;20","So in this case, there'sthis instruction, this assumption"
"00;10;05;02","00;10;09;15","implicitly or explicitlythat's drawn out through the exploration"
"00;10;09;15","00;10;13;25","of previous approachesto skillful performance and specifically"
"00;10;14;04","00;10;17;08","the motor representationsand motor commands that are implicit"
"00;10;17;17","00;10;19;27","in optimal motor control theory."
"00;10;19;27","00;10;22;26","So that's part one."
"00;10;22;26","00;10;26;04","Part two goes from optimal control"
"00;10;26;10","00;10;29;00","to predictivecoding and active inference."
"00;10;29;13","00;10;33;11","And last time we talked a little bitabout similarities and differences"
"00;10;33;11","00;10;37;28","as you go from optimal motor controlto predictive processing"
"00;10;38;03","00;10;42;24","to active inference, what is generalizedas you move from A to B to see"
"00;10;43;06","00;10;47;19","what is different, what kinds of issuesmight you sidestep or introduce?"
"00;10;48;13","00;10;52;01","And then in the last sectionsof the paper,"
"00;10;52;17","00;10;55;29","motor control is positively reframed"
"00;10;55;29","00;10;59;09","as this interactive sensorymotor engagement with a world"
"00;10;59;21","00;11;03;16","which puts us very squarelyin the domain of active inference"
"00;11;03;26","00;11;07;28","rather than in the instructions domain of optimal motor control theory."
"00;11;08;00","00;11;09;07","Greetings, Blue."
"00;11;09;07","00;11;12;15","So that's kind of a general patternthat we've seen before where the"
"00;11;12;20","00;11;15;28","first third of the paper is a backgroundon previous approaches"
"00;11;16;12","00;11;17;23","in a critical lens."
"00;11;17;23","00;11;21;20","The second approach showssome sort of a transition from theory"
"00;11;21;20","00;11;26;11","A to B to C, and then by the third part,there's a positive positivist argument"
"00;11;26;18","00;11;30;06","as to why active inferenceis more in line with how things are or"
"00;11;30;06","00;11;31;14","might be more useful."
"00;11;33;02","00;11;35;04","Stephen, go ahead."
"00;11;35;23","00;11;36;01","Yeah."
"00;11;36;01","00;11;38;25","Further to our conversation earlier,"
"00;11;38;25","00;11;42;20","I think this actually thisthis showing the instruction"
"00;11;42;26","00;11;45;12","and then the interactive approach"
"00;11;46;06","00;11;50;09","is really useful to sort ofhave a plausible way"
"00;11;50;29","00;11;57;02","for affect and social dynamicsto interplay with action"
"00;11;57;15","00;12;02;25","because when it's under an instruction,this model is kind of hard to imagine"
"00;12;02;25","00;12;07;26","how that kind of mechanical,almost message parsing type of approach"
"00;12;07;26","00;12;12;03","can integrateinto our sort of social dynamics."
"00;12;12;03","00;12;13;00","Whereas"
"00;12;13;25","00;12;17;15","the interactionand this approach does give that."
"00;12;18;17","00;12;20;25","So I think that's quite good."
"00;12;21;09","00;12;24;01","It can frighten people offbecause it brings in this other"
"00;12;24;15","00;12;27;10","philosophical piece,which I think a lot of people do like"
"00;12;27;23","00;12;29;05","running away from it first."
"00;12;29;05","00;12;32;28","But actually it does offer a more human"
"00;12;33;05","00;12;36;25","humanizing or biological way to engage"
"00;12;38;24","00;12;39;16","cool."
"00;12;39;16","00;12;41;16","Let's just go there,"
"00;12;41;16","00;12;44;07","blue, of course, raise your handanytime you want to something."
"00;12;44;07","00;12;47;28","But this instructionism versus interaction ism"
"00;12;48;15","00;12;52;09","I think is a big piecethat we'll walk away from this"
"00;12;53;10","00;12;55;18","23 with."
"00;12;55;18","00;12;59;02","It's something that we can take onin the case of embodied"
"00;12;59;02","00;12;59;29","skillful performance,"
"00;12;59;29","00;13;03;06","but I think we're going to be ableto apply it to education."
"00;13;03;06","00;13;05;25","We're going to be able to apply itto team collaboration."
"00;13;06;06","00;13;09;21","And so we can definitely returnto this distinction between instruction"
"00;13;09;21","00;13;11;15","ism and interaction ism."
"00;13;11;15","00;13;16;00","So Steven, just from,you know, your experience with drama"
"00;13;16;00","00;13;19;20","or other kinds of workdo you think people are"
"00;13;19;25","00;13;23;12","how do people implicitly useconstructionism versus interaction ism"
"00;13;23;12","00;13;26;22","or what kinds of scenarios support"
"00;13;26;22","00;13;30;22","or constrain constructionism versusallow for interactions to emerge?"
"00;13;32;08","00;13;35;10","Well, I I think what tends to happenis in the models"
"00;13;35;10","00;13;39;14","that people tend to use, they're kind ofeither in one camp or another."
"00;13;39;14","00;13;44;12","It's like so mostly it's almost implicitthat there's"
"00;13;44;12","00;13;49;16","some sort of interactive stroke flowis probably goes even further."
"00;13;49;16","00;13;53;10","It's sort of some sort of flowin the sort of performance arts world."
"00;13;53;10","00;13;56;20","They talk about flow and easeand that type of thing."
"00;13;57;12","00;14;00;02","And what's also interesting is I knowthey talk about this in the Michael"
"00;14;00;02","00;14;03;03","Chekhov acting approach is this always"
"00;14;03;03","00;14;06;21","this battle between ease and form."
"00;14;07;01","00;14;09;03","So a dancer gets more form,"
"00;14;09;03","00;14;12;13","they get more technique,they get more proficient their technique,"
"00;14;12;22","00;14;15;13","but they might lose that easethat you have as a beginner."
"00;14;15;23","00;14;18;16","So forever trying to add more technique"
"00;14;18;23","00;14;23;12","without becoming this kind of rigidor some automaton, you know?"
"00;14;23;21","00;14;26;15","So I think there's there'sthat kind of side to it."
"00;14;26;15","00;14;31;05","And that that whole area,they just go off and it's it's kind of"
"00;14;31;07","00;14;33;20","it just takes care of itself,but it becomes a little bit"
"00;14;34;26","00;14;37;10","of a silo in a way."
"00;14;37;17","00;14;42;16","And then you've got people workingin more straight activity theory,"
"00;14;42;23","00;14;47;23","bykofsky kind of much morelike what activity happened"
"00;14;47;23","00;14;53;23","when and that they they,they are also in a bit of a silo."
"00;14;53;23","00;14;56;15","So I think that you tend to find that"
"00;14;56;15","00;15;01;06","and different, different areas, they,they are a little bit siloed"
"00;15;01;07","00;15;05;05","in their approachesto sort of get around some of these"
"00;15;06;06","00;15;07;24","challenges."
"00;15;08;06","00;15;12;25","So I think that the way of tryingto break"
"00;15;13;13","00;15;19;07","beyond what you can analyze, which oftenyou have to look at instructionally"
"00;15;19;07","00;15;22;00","because you kind ofhave to break down things into steps."
"00;15;22;24","00;15;27;10","But that doesn't meanyou need to keep it in a stepwise form"
"00;15;27;16","00;15;31;13","in terms of how we understandwhat people really do."
"00;15;31;18","00;15;34;02","So there's this kind ofI think there's this kind of gap"
"00;15;34;14","00;15;37;10","that this will help to make plausible."
"00;15;40;26","00;15;42;03","Interesting there"
"00;15;42;03","00;15;45;14","how we capture the utility"
"00;15;45;23","00;15;48;13","and the apparentadvantages of constructionism"
"00;15;48;26","00;15;50;18","some of them are written here,like the ability"
"00;15;50;18","00;15;52;05","to separate different instructions."
"00;15;52;05","00;15;54;21","That seems pretty importantif you say, well,"
"00;15;54;27","00;15;57;12","how am I going to cookthis multi-stage dish"
"00;15;57;23","00;15;59;25","and someone just says,you know, here's all the ingredients"
"00;15;59;25","00;16;01;27","and here's all the behaviors,but I'm not going to tell you what"
"00;16;01;27","00;16;03;17","order to do what in."
"00;16;03;17","00;16;06;29","If we can't separate and sequence events,"
"00;16;07;19","00;16;10;23","then it's going to be hardto carry out a performance correctly."
"00;16;10;23","00;16;14;06","You can't just switch the orderof musical notes and the sheet music."
"00;16;14;18","00;16;16;18","You can't just do thingsin a different order."
"00;16;16;18","00;16;21;16","So how do we get some of the featuresthat we're looking for, like separate"
"00;16;21;16","00;16;26;21","ability of modularity and take it intoa fully interaction ist framework?"
"00;16;28;03","00;16;32;06","One distinctionthere that the authors raise is like"
"00;16;32;06","00;16;36;04","strong versus weak constructionism,and they'll"
"00;16;37;29","00;16;39;12","end up continuing that."
"00;16;39;12","00;16;43;01","Both of these formshave similar underpinnings,"
"00;16;43;15","00;16;47;16","but there's sort of a continuumbetween thinking that the instruction"
"00;16;47;16","00;16;51;07","ism is completelyits own neural representation ism."
"00;16;51;18","00;16;53;17","It's kind of like a MartinBaily type argument."
"00;16;53;17","00;16;55;11","This is the strong constructionism,"
"00;16;55;11","00;16;58;14","thinking that it's totally justthe neural representations"
"00;16;58;26","00;17;03;27","that are entirely specifying on their ownthe movements that have to be performed"
"00;17;04;16","00;17;09;01","versus a more dynamicor coupling version of instruction isms."
"00;17;09;19","00;17;12;18","So they'd be like,you know, when you're tapping the gas,"
"00;17;12;18","00;17;15;19","it's like an instruction to the engine,but it's not the entire"
"00;17;17;13","00;17;20;26","go faster cue given the background"
"00;17;20;26","00;17;24;24","of ecologically normal processesthat enable them to play this role."
"00;17;25;07","00;17;27;07","So that's kind of interesting."
"00;17;28;28","00;17;32;13","Blue any sort of overarching thoughtsor any where you think it'd be fun"
"00;17;32;13","00;17;37;06","to jump in now?"
"00;17;37;06","00;17;38;29","I'm just trying to figure out whereI'm at."
"00;17;38;29","00;17;41;11","So indeed,"
"00;17;43;22","00;17;46;07","will there be a few other places,like a few other notes"
"00;17;46;07","00;17;47;28","that we want to discuss?"
"00;17;47;28","00;17;53;00","Dean mentioned one thing maybewe can even have a dot three and find out"
"00;17;53;00","00;17;57;07","what a dot three would mean or a dotto point to one or something like that."
"00;17;57;07","00;17;58;24","Dot 21."
"00;17;58;25","00;18;02;20","So one piece was about the,the neural elements"
"00;18;03;01","00;18;06;29","because in the figures we do see brains."
"00;18;08;18","00;18;11;16","However, these are quite schematic."
"00;18;12;00","00;18;12;23","It's not saying"
"00;18;12;23","00;18;16;23","that these are the brain regionswhere these types of things happen,"
"00;18;16;29","00;18;20;19","which can be a little ambiguousbecause it's"
"00;18;20;19","00;18;23;26","not actuallyan anatomical representation yet."
"00;18;23;26","00;18;25;24","It's superimposed on top of a brain."
"00;18;27;05","00;18;28;19","OK, so one piece we wrote down"
"00;18;28;19","00;18;32;28","was about the neuraland I think there was a few yeah, yeah."
"00;18;32;28","00;18;34;07","Stephen, go for it."
"00;18;34;27","00;18;37;29","Yeah, just timeis, as you mentioned, about the streak."
"00;18;37;29","00;18;40;08","The weak and strong"
"00;18;40;08","00;18;43;01","is kind of interestingbecause that's kind of trying"
"00;18;43;01","00;18;47;10","to give this scientific feel,but it doesn't feel very satisfactory"
"00;18;47;10","00;18;51;07","to try and have to say it in terms ofweak and strong because you kind of think"
"00;18;51;07","00;18;55;05","this well, what does that really meanand how does it shift between the two?"
"00;18;55;05","00;18;57;27","I mean, I can understandwhat is being said, but"
"00;18;58;13","00;19;03;14","it's it gets into this kind of fuzzyversion of instruction ism."
"00;19;03;23","00;19;06;15","So I think that kind of sets upsome of these questions"
"00;19;06;15","00;19;10;11","that as soon as you moveaway from a strong instruction ism,"
"00;19;11;24","00;19;12;18","it becomes"
"00;19;12;18","00;19;15;24","harder to hold it togetherusing the word instruction ism."
"00;19;15;24","00;19;18;18","So I think that's it'squite a good illustration of that"
"00;19;19;01","00;19;21;18","because it's sort ofyou can see how the second paragraphs"
"00;19;21;18","00;19;23;18","a lot longer than the first one,basically."
"00;19;23;18","00;19;26;24","And yet great point."
"00;19;26;24","00;19;29;25","And it's also a common approach to"
"00;19;30;19","00;19;32;29","basically rigorousphilosophical argument."
"00;19;32;29","00;19;36;07","Instead of making an argumentagainst the total category,"
"00;19;36;20","00;19;38;28","you introducea distinction in the category"
"00;19;39;09","00;19;43;24","and then you might find that eitherone of those categories has some features"
"00;19;43;24","00;19;47;15","that the other one doesn't, you know,instead of being against all wars, well,"
"00;19;47;15","00;19;49;08","there's the good onesand there's the bad ones."
"00;19;49;08","00;19;51;17","And then here's my distinctionfor just the bad ones."
"00;19;51;27","00;19;54;11","Or it could bethat by making that distinction,"
"00;19;54;22","00;20;00;00","you then can say, actually, this holdstrue for both of these categories."
"00;20;00;12","00;20;01;24","Or subcategories."
"00;20;01;24","00;20;05;03","And so that'show I've made my claim against all X"
"00;20;05;11","00;20;07;23","is by first breaking it down."
"00;20;07;23","00;20;10;29","And then they do againfind that there are,"
"00;20;11;00","00;20;14;03","of course, are differences betweenthese two forms of constructionism,"
"00;20;14;12","00;20;18;14","but that they end up taking onsome of the same assumptions"
"00;20;20;24","00;20;23;12","cause there's probably a few other pieces"
"00;20;24;09","00;20;26;17","we can explore"
"00;20;28;04","00;20;30;10","this is the section in the paper"
"00;20;30;10","00;20;35;00","that I'm sharing on the screenthat says the formulation"
"00;20;35;10","00;20;38;25","of sensory motor controlin terms of optimal motor control theory"
"00;20;39;13","00;20;42;29","heavily hinges on two differentbut highly interconnected assumptions."
"00;20;43;15","00;20;46;17","So let's see what the assumptions are,because it's probable"
"00;20;46;17","00;20;50;12","that active inference is going to becontrasting or doing something different."
"00;20;51;11","00;20;55;07","So one is the central specificationof the sending motor commands"
"00;20;56;07","00;20;58;18","and they're efferent copiesin the form of detailed"
"00;20;58;18","00;21;01;17","low level instructionsfor control of the motor plan"
"00;21;01;24","00;21;05;04","specified in terms of an intrinsic frameof reference, i.e."
"00;21;05;04","00;21;07;27","extensionand contraction of muscle fibers."
"00;21;09;16","00;21;12;06","So that's that instruction ism."
"00;21;12;06","00;21;16;05","And then to a separation of forwardand inverse models"
"00;21;16;22","00;21;20;03","operating on complementaryaspects of action planning and execution."
"00;21;20;03","00;21;20;18","Awesome."
"00;21;21;05","00;21;25;15","So the first piece isthat instruction ism"
"00;21;26;00","00;21;29;13","that what's being sent descendingor towards"
"00;21;29;13","00;21;32;03","the body are instructions."
"00;21;32;24","00;21;37;15","And the second piece is a separationof the forward and the inverse models"
"00;21;38;00","00;21;41;20","operating on complementary aspectsof action, planning and execution."
"00;21;42;00","00;21;45;15","So the forward model is likesort of a planning model"
"00;21;45;19","00;21;48;14","and then the execution is like,OK, given what I planned,"
"00;21;49;11","00;21;51;03","how am I going to execute that?"
"00;21;51;03","00;21;54;20","And those are two different streamsin optimal motor control"
"00;21;55;05","00;21;58;01","and so we've been talking abouthow interaction ism"
"00;21;58;14","00;22;01;13","we can explore, how active inferencedeploys interaction ism."
"00;22;01;25","00;22;04;29","But in interaction ism,we have a contrast with the instruction"
"00;22;04;29","00;22;06;20","is 0.1."
"00;22;06;20","00;22;11;18","And then through a unifiedgenerative model in active inference"
"00;22;11;26","00;22;15;22","and the reduction of uncertaintyin a unified generative model, we're"
"00;22;15;22","00;22;21;16","going to move beyond this separationof these two forward and inverse models."
"00;22;22;00","00;22;22;13","Stephen."
"00;22;22;13","00;22;25;08","And then anyone elseor any questions in the life."
"00;22;26;18","00;22;27;29","Yeah, this is quite helpful."
"00;22;27;29","00;22;29;10","It gives that"
"00;22;29;25","00;22;32;26","realization the optimal"
"00;22;32;26","00;22;34;04","motor control theory."
"00;22;34;04","00;22;36;11","It could it can be very precise."
"00;22;36;11","00;22;39;15","You could imagine someone making a robotbecause you can measure everything."
"00;22;39;15","00;22;43;12","You've got access to all the dataand you could make something"
"00;22;43;18","00;22;45;00","within like a thousandth"
"00;22;45;00","00;22;49;15","of a millimeter precisionwhich humans or animals can't do."
"00;22;49;15","00;22;54;15","But it does have a bit of a limitationin terms of"
"00;22;55;23","00;22;56;28","being able to integrate."
"00;22;56;28","00;23;00;05","And I think that I don't knowif you've seen any of the papers around"
"00;23;00;23","00;23;04;28","the idea of Fieldsbeing around the robots joint."
"00;23;05;06","00;23;06;04","So that have like a field"
"00;23;06;04","00;23;09;28","around the hand, the field around theand just move into the field"
"00;23;10;10","00;23;13;22","rather than trying to work outwhat the actual muscle, what the actual"
"00;23;14;09","00;23;15;11","joints should do."
"00;23;15;11","00;23;19;28","And they, they out competed other robotswithin like two or three months."
"00;23;19;28","00;23;24;10","So this same idea of workingwith some sort of more fuzzy"
"00;23;25;14","00;23;27;12","dynamic to"
"00;23;27;12","00;23;29;25","build actually and just working out"
"00;23;29;25","00;23;33;07","what's works most efficiently or best"
"00;23;33;24","00;23;37;07","even though you're probably addinga lot more fuzziness into the actual"
"00;23;37;29","00;23;42;13","understanding of the measurements,actually has a lot of them, has"
"00;23;42;13","00;23;46;11","a lot of benefits in terms of learninghow to do something"
"00;23;46;11","00;23;50;02","quickly OK."
"00;23;50;17","00;23;53;12","I think there'll bea few more cool points to return to"
"00;23;53;12","00;23;56;26","on this notion of field,but I think it's also helpful here"
"00;23;56;26","00;23;59;17","to look at how they distinguishthe forward"
"00;24;00;05","00;24;02;17","and the inverse models."
"00;24;03;11","00;24;05;19","So here a Ford model"
"00;24;06;06","00;24;09;15","takes the system from an intrinsicto an X extrinsic frame,"
"00;24;09;22","00;24;12;14","predicting the effectsof different movements"
"00;24;12;24","00;24;16;04","using musculoskeletal plansspecified by neural activity."
"00;24;16;04","00;24;20;04","So again, that's that instruction ismthat's because we're in the optimal"
"00;24;20;04","00;24;21;11","motor control."
"00;24;21;11","00;24;24;24","So forward model is basically plans"
"00;24;25;16","00;24;29;03","that can be cognitiveinto implementations."
"00;24;29;24","00;24;33;29","That's the translation into motorof commands and their consequences."
"00;24;34;14","00;24;37;09","On the other hand,an inverse model builds"
"00;24;37;09","00;24;39;16","motor commandsby inverting the causal change."
"00;24;40;12","00;24;44;09","So first, that inverse model leveragesa value function of states."
"00;24;44;09","00;24;48;04","This is where we get the inoptimal motor control,"
"00;24;48;12","00;24;52;23","the non negotiable introduction of valueas the central terroristic"
"00;24;53;09","00;24;57;22","states have to be assigned valuebecause value is what's used to determine"
"00;24;57;22","00;24;59;01","which plans to select."
"00;25;00;06","00;25;00;29","And that"
"00;25;00;29","00;25;04;09","leverage on the valuefunction is used to form a mapping"
"00;25;04;17","00;25;10;06","from desired target states, which againis built into active inference"
"00;25;10;14","00;25;14;02","in a sense through the preferenceover certain types of states."
"00;25;14;11","00;25;18;27","But the desired target state has to bespecified in a slightly different way"
"00;25;19;07","00;25;22;26","as an actual preferred staterather than over a preferences."
"00;25;22;26","00;25;27;24","Overstates in this awful motorcontrol framework and that's in"
"00;25;27;24","00;25;31;08","the coordinate system based uponthe external consequences of movements."
"00;25;31;08","00;25;34;24","So I want mymy arm to be at a 90 degree angle"
"00;25;36;03","00;25;40;06","and then that is translatedor it's mapped to a set of"
"00;25;40;06","00;25;43;18","intrinsic coordinatesin the space of muscle fiber activations,"
"00;25;43;18","00;25;46;21","like my arm is at a greaterthan 90 degree angle."
"00;25;46;21","00;25;50;24","So that needs to mapto activation of biceps firing patterns"
"00;25;50;24","00;25;54;12","so that the arm can contract,so that the angle is smaller"
"00;25;55;07","00;25;58;29","and that's why frameworks based upon"
"00;25;58;29","00;26;03;01","optimal motor control are sometimescharacterized in terms of force control,"
"00;26;03;18","00;26;08;07","because all the motor commandsspecify is muscle forces and joint talks."
"00;26;08;22","00;26;13;25","So that's kind of the macro to micromapping is we have preferred states"
"00;26;14;03","00;26;17;27","and the question is there's somany degrees of freedom with the joints."
"00;26;18;09","00;26;22;21","So how do we go from potentiallya broad set of preferred states"
"00;26;22;21","00;26;29;15","or acceptable states into a specificpattern of muscular activations?"
"00;26;29;22","00;26;31;19","So how do you go from"
"00;26;31;19","00;26;35;15","make your hand just rest where it'scomfortable, which is a relatively broad"
"00;26;36;20","00;26;38;24","sort of plateau of accessible states"
"00;26;38;24","00;26;41;21","into a position that each joint"
"00;26;41;21","00;26;44;12","is going to be at equilibrium with"
"00;26;45;01","00;26;49;27","and the two of these assumptionsthat we've been exploring here."
"00;26;50;09","00;26;54;00","So again, one, the obstructionismand two, the separation of forward"
"00;26;54;01","00;26;58;28","inverse model,that architecture induces the assumption"
"00;26;58;28","00;27;03;07","or rests on the assumption that valuevaluable states is what causes action"
"00;27;03;25","00;27;07;19","and that's whatthat first in 2011 paper introduced"
"00;27;07;25","00;27;11;27","is sort of flipped that on its head,which is that well"
"00;27;14;12","00;27;16;27","in models from omc t sequences of action"
"00;27;16;27","00;27;19;19","are selected according to the valuefunction of their states."
"00;27;20;04","00;27;23;22","So value is somethingthat's cognitive and induces action"
"00;27;24;09","00;27;29;09","but that gets sort of flippedin the 2011 perspective"
"00;27;29;09","00;27;32;28","because value is a function of thestates, not a cause of them."
"00;27;34;16","00;27;36;08","So yeah,"
"00;27;41;05","00;27;45;03","as written here, value is an attributeof states that are caused by movement."
"00;27;45;03","00;27;49;04","It's a consequence, not a causeand when we get"
"00;27;50;07","00;27;54;16","loops, you know which ones,a cause of which something that's local"
"00;27;54;19","00;27;58;03","locally A causes Bbut then you pull back A level"
"00;27;58;03","00;28;02;06","and maybe the relationship can also beseen as sort of the other direction"
"00;28;02;18","00;28;07;23","or maybe with feedback systemsor embodied systems,"
"00;28;08;02","00;28;13;08","we move beyond just any single linearframing of what causes what,"
"00;28;13;28","00;28;18;06","but regardless of the directionor whether value is an attribute a states"
"00;28;18;14","00;28;21;02","or it's a consequence or it's a cause,"
"00;28;21;02","00;28;24;11","the point is there stillis this central value parameter"
"00;28;24;11","00;28;28;29","in optimal motor control theoryand that value parameter,"
"00;28;28;29","00;28;30;16","which is familiar to reinforcement"
"00;28;30;16","00;28;34;04","learning like learning preferable statesbased upon their predicted value."
"00;28;34;17","00;28;38;00","That's something that we're goingto be able to build on"
"00;28;38;00","00;28;41;06","in active inference by pursuingnot just value,"
"00;28;41;13","00;28;45;21","but also allowing for reductionof uncertainty in a generative model."
"00;28;45;29","00;28;49;21","Which could include pragmatic or valuedriven elements, but also elements"
"00;28;49;28","00;28;52;09","that include curiosity like drives."
"00;28;52;25","00;28;54;11","Stephen and then anyone else."
"00;28;55;27","00;28;56;12","And this"
"00;28;56;12","00;28;59;17","ties inwith Kaspar Hess work with Affect."
"00;28;59;17","00;29;04;00","You could imagine that the affectivestates are kind of generated"
"00;29;05;04","00;29;07;13","on the fly at different scales."
"00;29;07;13","00;29;11;02","So as you start to move maybe slowly"
"00;29;11;02","00;29;15;03","as you practice youthese value states are kind"
"00;29;15;03","00;29;20;07","of almost revealedand not necessarily available."
"00;29;20;07","00;29;24;06","And then maybe there's a state,but once the whole action's complete"
"00;29;24;19","00;29;30;15","and that gives you an end to that valuestate, which may be only appears as that"
"00;29;32;05","00;29;35;25","degree of surprise all is realized"
"00;29;35;25","00;29;38;28","and it's always going to be slightlydifferent each time you do something."
"00;29;38;28","00;29;41;24","So this this is quite cool."
"00;29;43;20","00;29;44;28","I've moved here"
"00;29;44;28","00;29;49;06","to that kind of vectorfield representation"
"00;29;49;11","00;29;51;25","of the difference between value only"
"00;29;53;00","00;29;55;04","learning and performance."
"00;29;55;04","00;29;59;14","Here's our robot who's only interestedin kind of taking a ruler,"
"00;29;59;20","00;30;03;09","putting it on the hill and then going inthe direction of the ruler going uphill."
"00;30;03;20","00;30;07;23","That's the sort of scalarapproach to pursuing peaks."
"00;30;09;08","00;30;11;09","In contrast, we have"
"00;30;11;09","00;30;15;12","that pickclimbing or hill climbing element"
"00;30;16;10","00;30;20;08","in active inference as that irritationor longitudinal currents."
"00;30;20;24","00;30;22;27","But we also get this solid oil element."
"00;30;23;08","00;30;26;15","So I'm wondering, talking to people about"
"00;30;26;29","00;30;30;19","performance, for example,or training in some way"
"00;30;31;11","00;30;33;20","how would it be different to promote"
"00;30;34;08","00;30;39;05","this sort of value,an equal value flow model"
"00;30;39;17","00;30;43;11","rather than a comparative rewarddriven model?"
"00;30;43;21","00;30;45;05","Like if"
"00;30;45;16","00;30;49;26","a learner is constantly assessingwhether it's a multiple choice test"
"00;30;49;26","00;30;52;25","or whether it's baseballpitching or something like that,"
"00;30;53;11","00;30;57;02","the learner is alwaysassessing the value of states"
"00;30;57;15","00;31;00;10","and everything is framedas value maximization"
"00;31;00;10","00;31;03;27","and you're going to want to be doingaccurate states."
"00;31;04;07","00;31;06;15","You want, you know, the pitch,you want to be getting your pitches"
"00;31;06;15","00;31;09;09","more accuratebecause more accurate is more rewarding."
"00;31;10;05","00;31;15;03","I'm just wondering how it changestraining or the experience of practice"
"00;31;15;21","00;31;19;22","to know that there's timeswhen one is pursuing value"
"00;31;19;22","00;31;23;00","or that in the long rangepursuit of value can be achieved through"
"00;31;23;08","00;31;27;01","this rotationalor exploratory element blue."
"00;31;27;01","00;31;28;04","And then anyone else."
"00;31;30;06","00;31;31;23","So just talking about pitching"
"00;31;31;23","00;31;35;26","specifically, like, yeah, you can,you know, hit the bull's eye, right?"
"00;31;35;26","00;31;39;01","If you're going to pitch, you know,pitch a ball, you can hit the bull's eye"
"00;31;39;01","00;31;41;05","you can hit the target,get it right over home plate."
"00;31;41;14","00;31;45;20","But like you never explorelike what about like spinning the ball?"
"00;31;45;20","00;31;48;22","What effects will like different spinsthat you put on the ball"
"00;31;48;22","00;31;51;15","have on, you know,the way that the batter hits it."
"00;31;51;23","00;31;54;26","So like the accuracy versuslike the finesse of it."
"00;31;54;26","00;31;57;01","And I think about thatin terms of dance also."
"00;31;57;01","00;32;01;29","Like if you're not, you don't explorelike, you know what it feels like."
"00;32;01;29","00;32;04;05","Like if you're only tryingto accurately make a movement,"
"00;32;04;13","00;32;07;09","you're never exploringlike the finesse element of it."
"00;32;07;09","00;32;11;24","So there's no like room for perfectionor like ultimate mastery."
"00;32;11;24","00;32;12;08","I think"
"00;32;16;01","00;32;19;09","and where does skill become mastery?"
"00;32;19;09","00;32;22;13","It's sort of like at least in chess,it's the, the masters"
"00;32;22;13","00;32;26;01","who appear to challengesome of the basic rules."
"00;32;26;01","00;32;27;21","Like they don't castle early"
"00;32;27;21","00;32;32;07","because there's some deeper planor a jazz musician who moves"
"00;32;32;07","00;32;37;02","beyond the framework of regulartiming to introduce some other elements."
"00;32;37;13","00;32;41;09","So that play element becomesespecially important."
"00;32;41;17","00;32;46;08","It's almost like if you never learnhow to do it correctly or normatively,"
"00;32;46;12","00;32;49;05","you can't throw the baseball,so you got to get it over the plate."
"00;32;49;15","00;32;53;01","But then the mastery levelafter performance"
"00;32;53;01","00;32;58;09","has been demonstrated in sense involvesinventing a new way to pitch."
"00;32;58;09","00;33;02;09","Like there's, you know, a fractionof baseball pitchers who throw sidearm"
"00;33;02;15","00;33;06;22","or throw knuckleball, all these differentsort of unconventional approaches"
"00;33;07;01","00;33;10;07","that art, the value functionthat they learned initially,"
"00;33;10;17","00;33;13;20","or maybe it was their biomechanicsand that was the value function"
"00;33;13;20","00;33;16;23","that worked for them and some other valuefunction just wouldn't"
"00;33;16;23","00;33;19;08","have worked with their body and brain."
"00;33;20;00","00;33;21;22","Stephen And then anyone else"
"00;33;23;16","00;33;23;25","yeah."
"00;33;23;25","00;33;28;13","Thinking from the perspectiveof coaching, who's so my supervisors"
"00;33;28;14","00;33;31;12","works a lot with systemic coachingand performance coaching"
"00;33;32;04","00;33;35;29","is thisthis becomes a more unifying approach."
"00;33;35;29","00;33;38;13","It might be four specific things."
"00;33;38;16","00;33;41;21","Optimal optimal controltheory is quite useful for just"
"00;33;42;11","00;33;44;25","unpacking something, but if you want to"
"00;33;44;25","00;33;49;06","look at performancecoaching more broadly or developmental"
"00;33;49;06","00;33;53;06","coaching more broadlyand how they relate this could be useful."
"00;33;53;06","00;33;56;21","And I'm just thinking about KristianErickson, you know, the soccer player."
"00;33;56;22","00;34;01;08","Then if you heard he collapsedduring the euro's and his heart stopped"
"00;34;01;22","00;34;04;07","and all the team were around himtrying to"
"00;34;04;18","00;34;08;05","and then they had to play the gamein about an hour's time."
"00;34;08;18","00;34;12;08","Now, their ability to perform"
"00;34;13;18","00;34;15;18","was going to be very hard."
"00;34;16;07","00;34;19;01","It's not a performancecoaching question at that point."
"00;34;19;01","00;34;22;08","There's these other dynamics going onand I think that"
"00;34;23;02","00;34;25;23","this this ability for active influence"
"00;34;25;23","00;34;28;07","to at least unify"
"00;34;28;29","00;34;32;06","how regimes can changeand how it could be the environment,"
"00;34;32;11","00;34;36;08","the system, thethe emotions, all these things are quite."
"00;34;37;13","00;34;38;28","Quite useful"
"00;34;40;22","00;34;42;16","thanks, Dean."
"00;34;43;00","00;34;43;21","Yeah."
"00;34;44;29","00;34;45;08","Yeah."
"00;34;45;08","00;34;47;09","I appreciate what you're sayingthere, Steve."
"00;34;47;09","00;34;53;12","I am aside from that, from the stepby step part that I think"
"00;34;53;12","00;34;55;19","the caudate nucleus"
"00;34;55;19","00;35;00;03","tends to to performwhen we're when we're trying to climb"
"00;35;00;03","00;35;02;12","that little mountain there robotically."
"00;35;03;29","00;35;06;06","It's another factor,I think that's kind of interesting."
"00;35;06;06","00;35;07;05","And that's"
"00;35;07;29","00;35;10;14","if it's embodied in its skill,"
"00;35;10;14","00;35;12;28","there's probably threekinds of math at play."
"00;35;12;28","00;35;17;00","There's the materialization,the how sort of the engineering of it."
"00;35;17;19","00;35;21;02","There's the what's in, what's out,what's superfluous"
"00;35;21;02","00;35;25;27","and what what needs to be an elementwithin the performance."
"00;35;25;27","00;35;29;10","And then I think what this paper does inthe interaction is pieces."
"00;35;29;10","00;35;35;02","It brings the,the probably into the conversation."
"00;35;35;23","00;35;37;28","And I think youneed all three kinds of, of"
"00;35;39;19","00;35;41;05","calculations in order to"
"00;35;41;05","00;35;44;08","be able to get a real gripon, on what's going on."
"00;35;44;08","00;35;49;16","Maybe not an optimal grip,at least a fuzzy grip on what to do next."
"00;35;49;16","00;35;52;12","I think if you only have twoof those elements,"
"00;35;53;00","00;35;55;26","you've got the perfect conditionsfor an instrumentalist approach."
"00;35;55;26","00;35;59;06","When you add the probablywhether it's Erickson"
"00;36;01;12","00;36;04;02","what did he text or emailall of his his teammates"
"00;36;04;02","00;36;07;26","and said, go finish the game, we got it,we got to finish this game."
"00;36;08;05","00;36;09;10","And I think Stephen's right."
"00;36;09;10","00;36;12;14","You can you can give it an instructionto your teammates"
"00;36;12;24","00;36;16;00","and say, I'm fine,but you just had a cardiac arrest"
"00;36;16;14","00;36;20;26","and we probably aren't going to be ableto wipe that from our memory."
"00;36;21;03","00;36;22;13","In that moment."
"00;36;22;13","00;36;25;20","And so it's a little bit more complicatedwhen we add probably."
"00;36;26;00","00;36;29;01","But I think we need probably in orderfor it to be interactions."
"00;36;31;02","00;36;32;12","So that"
"00;36;32;17","00;36;36;17","team like in the middle of the game,the personnel of the team"
"00;36;36;26","00;36;40;08","changed in the individual story."
"00;36;40;08","00;36;41;06","Of motor control."
"00;36;41;06","00;36;44;19","It's like, but that's not betweenyou and the soccer ball."
"00;36;44;19","00;36;46;16","So why should it change performance?"
"00;36;46;16","00;36;49;28","But when we have the deepgenerative model of the individual"
"00;36;50;04","00;36;51;03","that includes affect,"
"00;36;51;03","00;36;54;24","that's one way to get to the lossof a teammate influencing performance."
"00;36;55;05","00;36;55;26","And the second way"
"00;36;55;26","00;36;59;28","would be to actually genuinelyallow teams to be skillful performers"
"00;37;00;18","00;37;04;10","in the sense that there's a distributedcognitive process on the team"
"00;37;04;10","00;37;06;08","just like there is in the body."
"00;37;06;08","00;37;08;21","And so they actually changed."
"00;37;08;25","00;37;12;12","And whoever steps into that person'sposition on the field,"
"00;37;12;25","00;37;14;15","they're going to havea different approach."
"00;37;14;15","00;37;18;10","So it'd be like switching out,you know, one arm for another arm"
"00;37;18;22","00;37;21;13","or one forager an estimate for another,an estimate."
"00;37;21;23","00;37;24;06","It's going to changethe emergent properties of the group"
"00;37;24;17","00;37;27;20","in a waythat's an explanation at the group level"
"00;37;27;20","00;37;32;06","rather than requiring to come backto just the optimal motor control,"
"00;37;32;15","00;37;36;16","valuedriven instruction, guided of a Body Blue"
"00;37;39;16","00;37;39;27","Yeah."
"00;37;39;27","00;37;43;11","Just the probably is likewhat gives active inference?"
"00;37;43;11","00;37;44;15","It's power, right?"
"00;37;44;15","00;37;48;21","Like probably if I don't eat breakfast,I'm going to collapse"
"00;37;48;21","00;37;52;22","in the middle of a field,you know, or playing a game or whatever."
"00;37;53;13","00;37;57;05","So so when you have that, thatprobably it allows you to guide"
"00;37;57;05","00;38;00;29","all of your actionstoward a given intention, I think."
"00;38;02;11","00;38;04;11","Thanks, Blue Stephen."
"00;38;04;12","00;38;04;21","Yeah."
"00;38;04;27","00;38;09;15","And I also think when probably becauseprobably is often is still in that value"
"00;38;09;19","00;38;13;03","my world, you know probablyI will get this gain or that gain"
"00;38;13;03","00;38;17;15","when the word uncertainty is put inuncertainty is a much scarier word."
"00;38;17;15","00;38;21;17","Than probability because it's likeit has that risk component."
"00;38;23;01","00;38;25;21","That's really interestingthat you say that that that"
"00;38;27;02","00;38;29;29","we tend to sayprobably everything will be OK,"
"00;38;30;01","00;38;33;15","but out of importanceis like you don't know."
"00;38;34;28","00;38;37;03","It's all it's all unknown to some extent."
"00;38;38;28","00;38;42;07","Here's here'sanother nice piece from the paper"
"00;38;42;07","00;38;45;10","that I think can continue this discussionabout probability"
"00;38;45;10","00;38;48;12","and maybe also how active inferencereframes it."
"00;38;49;03","00;38;52;07","So the physics of flow embeddedin active inference."
"00;38;52;14","00;38;55;24","Now it's an ongoing discussion. Exactly."
"00;38;55;24","00;38;58;25","The Formalismsthat get us to a physics of information"
"00;38;58;25","00;39;02;19","flow on sense cognition in action."
"00;39;02;26","00;39;06;17","So otherlive streams, other days, other years"
"00;39;06;26","00;39;09;08","but let's just rollwith this physics of flow."
"00;39;10;12","00;39;12;22","It's accounting for sensorymotor behavior"
"00;39;13;03","00;39;16;06","to show that motionin a biologically realistic state space."
"00;39;16;06","00;39;19;10","Irreducibly includestwo orthogonal kinds of motion,"
"00;39;19;27","00;39;22;10","the irritationand the solenoid or component."
"00;39;22;11","00;39;24;03","So that's what we are looking at here."
"00;39;24;03","00;39;27;13","Just this is a paragraphthat's representing this piece"
"00;39;27;18","00;39;30;26","instead of just valueonly we have value and flow."
"00;39;31;02","00;39;33;26","And again, this is key to reiteratebecause it's something"
"00;39;33;26","00;39;38;11","that isn't includedin reward scalar representations."
"00;39;39;11","00;39;39;26","So the"
"00;39;39;26","00;39;43;27","former that the first one,the curl free, is what allows the flow"
"00;39;43;27","00;39;48;01","to climb a gradient towards more valuableor probable states."
"00;39;48;15","00;39;51;03","Now that's one of the headscratchers and active inference"
"00;39;51;09","00;39;54;02","that preferred states are likely states"
"00;39;54;26","00;39;57;13","under an optimistic deepgenerative model."
"00;39;57;29","00;40;00;19","And that is the alignment"
"00;40;01;04","00;40;05;05","that allows us to reduce uncertaintyand by way"
"00;40;05;05","00;40;09;01","of reducing uncertainty achieveour target outcomes."
"00;40;09;25","00;40;12;19","And so when we align the deepgenerative model"
"00;40;13;01","00;40;17;20","in an optimistic way such that we believethat likely states are preferred ones,"
"00;40;18;04","00;40;21;06","that it's likely that tomorrowI'll have a regular body temperature,"
"00;40;21;13","00;40;25;00","it's likely that tomorrowI'll be in this preferred body position,"
"00;40;25;18","00;40;30;07","then we actually get to pursue value"
"00;40;30;24","00;40;33;27","as a consequence of reducing uncertainty."
"00;40;34;12","00;40;35;09","There's more to say on this."
"00;40;35;09","00;40;37;01","But Dean, go for it. And then Stephen."
"00;40;38;04","00;40;38;29","Yeah, and I think, Daniel,"
"00;40;38;29","00;40;42;18","that what that points outis that there's a dependency for people"
"00;40;42;21","00;40;47;19","who want to introducestatistical propositions"
"00;40;48;05","00;40;51;13","to what's the underlying situationthat we're observing."
"00;40;53;04","00;40;57;03","There's a dependency on the derivativemath and the accounting math."
"00;40;57;20","00;41;01;06","You can'tyou can't figure out what probably is"
"00;41;01;23","00;41;04;12","without figuring out how and what"
"00;41;04;12","00;41;07;16","and having a having a a sense of"
"00;41;08;24","00;41;11;01","confidence around what, how and what are."
"00;41;11;17","00;41;14;17","So I don't think it'sit isn't just the introduction."
"00;41;14;26","00;41;18;10","The fact of the inference, activeinference is also wholly dependent"
"00;41;18;10","00;41;21;14","on a strong foundation in terms of"
"00;41;22;03","00;41;25;07","really being able to get"
"00;41;25;07","00;41;27;22","from priors"
"00;41;27;22","00;41;29;14","through that hidden state."
"00;41;29;14","00;41;30;15","And how do we do that?"
"00;41;30;15","00;41;34;14","We have to have derivativesand we have to have accounts"
"00;41;34;29","00;41;37;26","so I think there's a real codependency."
"00;41;37;26","00;41;41;00","Back to the between commentthat Stephen brought up"
"00;41;43;05","00;41;43;26","Cool."
"00;41;43;26","00;41;45;13","Thanks, Stephen."
"00;41;47;09","00;41;49;19","Yeah, that that that idea of"
"00;41;52;11","00;41;54;15","things going through cycles,"
"00;41;54;29","00;41;59;16","I think I'm not going to go into thisagain, but, you know, it often comes up"
"00;41;59;16","00;42;04;13","is that's from what I'm understanding isis pretty much not present"
"00;42;04;13","00;42;09;07","in optimal motor control theorybecause it's it's about you go there"
"00;42;09;18","00;42;13;07","and then now you have a vectorand that vector is a thing"
"00;42;13;29","00;42;17;15","and that thing gets optimizedbut you never have that thing"
"00;42;17;15","00;42;22;01","I think like the messinessthat kind of in between"
"00;42;22;14","00;42;25;24","and you'rekind of holding that in between both."
"00;42;25;24","00;42;29;03","But that only makes senseif you keep revisiting the in-between."
"00;42;29;18","00;42;33;04","Like if the you need to have earlierdecisions, whatever."
"00;42;33;08","00;42;35;25","I mean, that's an open questionagain for another day. But"
"00;42;36;26","00;42;40;00","the some waythat you're revisiting this understanding"
"00;42;40;00","00;42;43;28","because otherwise you've gotno way to make any sort of information"
"00;42;44;20","00;42;49;03","gains or information extractionunless you have a revisiting"
"00;42;49;15","00;42;51;09","to compare."
"00;42;52;13","00;42;53;26","Interesting"
"00;42;55;08","00;42;58;18","and it's one of the key"
"00;42;58;25","00;43;02;22","pieces, again,that we reduce our uncertainty"
"00;43;02;22","00;43;05;27","and achieve preferred statesthrough that process."
"00;43;06;08","00;43;10;01","I'm just imagining, you know,something from organic chemistry."
"00;43;10;10","00;43;12;25","It's like you want to study up,"
"00;43;13;14","00;43;15;25","cram for your final and OK,you want to pass."
"00;43;16;06","00;43;19;06","So are you going to take a reinforcementlearning perspective"
"00;43;19;06","00;43;20;28","or an active inference perspective?"
"00;43;20;28","00;43;21;23","Well, the reinforcement"
"00;43;21;23","00;43;25;14","learning perspective is like sayingyou'll get the big reward when you pass."
"00;43;25;24","00;43;28;23","So what's the most rewarding problemthat we should be"
"00;43;28;23","00;43;31;11","solving or what's the mostrewarding chapter to review?"
"00;43;31;24","00;43;34;22","But you don't knowbecause if you knew then you'd pass."
"00;43;34;22","00;43;38;05","OK, so you're kind of right backat square zero with value"
"00;43;38;14","00;43;41;21","because you framed learningas a value question."
"00;43;42;13","00;43;45;29","In contrast, the active inferencelearner would be like, Oh sure,"
"00;43;45;29","00;43;47;07","my preference is to pass."
"00;43;48;06","00;43;49;09","How am I going to"
"00;43;49;09","00;43;52;26","reduce my uncertaintyabout the critical path of passing?"
"00;43;53;03","00;43;55;19","Well, let'sI haven't even open the textbook."
"00;43;55;19","00;43;58;19","Let's go to the first table of contentsor something like that."
"00;43;58;28","00;44;02;25","Like reduction of uncertaintygives a first step"
"00;44;03;15","00;44;06;09","and then it even allows for, OK,maybe that wasn't"
"00;44;06;09","00;44;09;16","even the right first step,or maybe that was a good two step path."
"00;44;09;16","00;44;13;27","And now I'm ready to go a different way,but I'm trying to reduce my uncertainty"
"00;44;13;27","00;44;18;24","about how to get to what I prefer,which is passing"
"00;44;19;07","00;44;23;07","rather than I've Apriori valuedthis future state,"
"00;44;23;23","00;44;26;15","and now I'm going to back propagate value"
"00;44;26;15","00;44;29;27","at every single step of the line,and then I'm going to stress myself out."
"00;44;29;27","00;44;33;11","If this specific chapterisn't maximal, rewarding"
"00;44;33;23","00;44;36;10","because everything again has to get"
"00;44;36;25","00;44;39;04","reduced to value in this"
"00;44;39;25","00;44;41;29","value is everything framework"
"00;44;42;15","00;44;44;21","but in the uncertainty reductionframework,"
"00;44;45;06","00;44;51;03","we see sort of this mist of uncertaintyand then regularities"
"00;44;51;03","00;44;54;06","and especially dependable onesemerge out of that."
"00;44;54;20","00;44;57;05","And so we're planning amidst uncertainty"
"00;44;57;18","00;45;00;19","with preferences in mind,trying to figure out what to do."
"00;45;00;22","00;45;04;02","That's planningas inference amidst uncertainty,"
"00;45;04;24","00;45;06;28","which is just a world apart"
"00;45;07;11","00;45;10;10","from planning to maximize valuethrough time"
"00;45;10;25","00;45;15;06","given, you know, what model againof how value is assigned."
"00;45;15;14","00;45;17;09","It's just a recursive question."
"00;45;17;09","00;45;20;21","And value learningdoesn't give us that higher level answer"
"00;45;20;26","00;45;24;10","for how we should actually goabout planning to obtain values,"
"00;45;24;16","00;45;28;11","let alone critiquing valueas a pervasive framework."
"00;45;28;16","00;45;28;28","Stephen"
"00;45;31;10","00;45;33;16","Well, actually that's a very interesting"
"00;45;33;16","00;45;36;27","talking about organic chemistryexperiences at university"
"00;45;36;27","00;45;41;16","that I had an absolute nightmareon my organic chemistry I mean,"
"00;45;41;17","00;45;45;06","I give my textbook to someoneI got behind on the organic side"
"00;45;45;06","00;45;49;20","and it was this like two inch thicktextbook on organic chemistry."
"00;45;49;20","00;45;52;19","And every time you go into it'sgot so many words, it's long names."
"00;45;52;19","00;45;55;09","And all this is going onis really interesting"
"00;45;55;09","00;45;57;26","because we had this classwith a new professor"
"00;45;58;06","00;46;00;17","and he got there and he got a few peopleto go up to the board"
"00;46;00;27","00;46;03;23","and it became clearthat absolutely no one"
"00;46;03;23","00;46;06;29","knew the organic chemistryand no one had seemed to pick up on this."
"00;46;06;29","00;46;08;05","So we are now in the second year,"
"00;46;08;05","00;46;10;15","no one knew they were doing,I think was even the third year"
"00;46;11;01","00;46;14;25","and he said and he said,you recommended a little thin exercise"
"00;46;14;25","00;46;18;18","book with exercises,not on all the different"
"00;46;18;18","00;46;22;14","chemical reactions and all the structureand it just the key reactions."
"00;46;22;14","00;46;25;07","And just to go through these exercisesin this thin book."
"00;46;25;07","00;46;29;09","And basically that got methrough the exam and got me on track."
"00;46;29;09","00;46;32;22","No and you know, sogoing for the big book and the"
"00;46;33;14","00;46;37;25","the memorizing and the optimal control,it was just work out"
"00;46;37;25","00;46;42;12","the five key types of reactionand do the exercises."
"00;46;42;21","00;46;43;18","And I think that speaks"
"00;46;43;18","00;46;47;02","to what you were talking about there,you know, which ways the electrons move"
"00;46;47;17","00;46;51;11","and that suddenly really,really changed everything."
"00;46;54;15","00;46;54;29","There's also"
"00;46;54;29","00;46;58;15","some fun drilling happening,of course, all around me."
"00;46;58;29","00;47;00;13","Welcome back,"
"00;47;01;12","00;47;02;06","Dave."
"00;47;03;02","00;47;07;28","So this section right here,it's it's a nice challenge."
"00;47;07;28","00;47;10;16","It increases the difficulty of speaking,but it's fun."
"00;47;11;11","00;47;15;05","This is a challenge for other frameworks."
"00;47;15;20","00;47;18;09","This idea that the two flows together"
"00;47;18;09","00;47;22;10","provide a richer framework for expressingskill, fullness as a process"
"00;47;22;10","00;47;26;04","whose characteristic go beyonda simple gradient of value accuracy."
"00;47;26;11","00;47;30;00","So we saw that reward is enoughpaper recently."
"00;47;30;00","00;47;32;22","And some participants at our labare kind of curious"
"00;47;32;22","00;47;36;16","about writing a responsebecause that's the whole argument is they"
"00;47;36;16","00;47;40;14","said, hey, reward is enough,the kernel can be reward."
"00;47;40;14","00;47;44;18","And that's how you get all of theseintelligent behaviors provided"
"00;47;44;18","00;47;49;25","that you have these second level tweakson the model or these bolted on modules."
"00;47;50;12","00;47;55;03","And then the contention of the authorshere is that value functions"
"00;47;55;16","00;47;59;19","and indeed any motor schemebased upon functions that return scalars"
"00;48;00;14","00;48;03;26","are not up to the taskof modeling the variety of skillful acts"
"00;48;03;26","00;48;06;16","describing human behavior,any kind of behavior"
"00;48;06;16","00;48;10;25","just human, because by constructionthey cannot account for the solenoid"
"00;48;10;25","00;48;11;24","or aspect of flow."
"00;48;12;25","00;48;15;18","So that's pretty interesting that"
"00;48;15;18","00;48;19;15","when we have to bottleneckinto a single number,"
"00;48;20;07","00;48;22;17","we lose a lot of the expressive ity"
"00;48;23;05","00;48;27;18","that allows for exploreand exploit behavior to almost coexist"
"00;48;27;28","00;48;30;15","because we're collapsingonto a number line."
"00;48;30;27","00;48;34;19","So there's extremely limitedavailability for, you know,"
"00;48;35;12","00;48;37;19","what do you want for your main dishand your side dish?"
"00;48;37;19","00;48;39;29","And you just say seven,"
"00;48;40;01","00;48;43;02","you can't express two thingswith just one number,"
"00;48;43;24","00;48;45;28","but if you could say, you know,seven and three,"
"00;48;46;12","00;48;49;00","you could express somethingthat's more in"
"00;48;49;00","00;48;52;26","a two dimensional space. Blue"
"00;48;53;05","00;48;54;19","so I think you bring up an interesting"
"00;48;54;19","00;48;57;29","point about any behavioror just human behavior."
"00;48;58;15","00;49;03;15","And I think about, you know, there's likedolphins that use tools, right,"
"00;49;03;17","00;49;07;28","to crack open like fish and or to crackopen not the fish, but the"
"00;49;09;07","00;49;10;06","the sea urchins, right?"
"00;49;10;06","00;49;12;15","So there's dolphinsthat use tools for eating"
"00;49;12;15","00;49;13;26","and then there's dolphins that don't."
"00;49;13;26","00;49;16;05","And so is there."
"00;49;16;05","00;49;18;21","And like this is like a hereditarylike it's"
"00;49;18;21","00;49;21;16","an example of cultural evolutionin dolphins, actually."
"00;49;21;24","00;49;25;00","So it's, you know, it's hereditary,but only because"
"00;49;25;09","00;49;28;05","it's passed on throughlearning and social learning."
"00;49;28;05","00;49;28;19","Right?"
"00;49;28;25","00;49;33;04","So you bring upand then we saw the motor plant, right?"
"00;49;33;04","00;49;36;10","Like the motorized plants,like does the plant learn"
"00;49;36;10","00;49;39;17","where the likehow like skillful performance?"
"00;49;39;17","00;49;42;20","I mean, this is a skill for performanceon the part of the plant."
"00;49;43;01","00;49;46;20","So it's a really interesting questionwhether, you know, I mean, we think about"
"00;49;46;20","00;49;50;26","active inference as applying to all nonequilibrium steady state systems, but"
"00;49;52;03","00;49;55;00","does this maybe apply only in the human"
"00;49;55;09","00;49;59;13","sense of movement, movementor what about like tribes of humans?"
"00;49;59;13","00;50;03;21","Like what about like in a nomadic kindof population with the supply there also"
"00;50;06;00","00;50;06;24","cool."
"00;50;07;12","00;50;10;06","Here's another nice piece in this section"
"00;50;10;10","00;50;12;28","that I think will be usefulfor us to learn about."
"00;50;13;17","00;50;17;24","So technically, it's easier to readwhen it's already been written."
"00;50;18;08","00;50;20;22","When you're gettingthe drilling experience,"
"00;50;21;05","00;50;24;02","that's when it's the hardestto skillfully improvise."
"00;50;24;02","00;50;26;05","But reading is a little easier."
"00;50;26;05","00;50;30;02","Technically, active inferenceextends popular predictive coding"
"00;50;30;02","00;50;33;07","models used in neuroscience,where perception is"
"00;50;34;01","00;50;38;12","critical only perception is cast in termsof prediction error minimization."
"00;50;38;20","00;50;40;20","So that's the classic rule in Ballard."
"00;50;40;21","00;50;42;11","99 paper."
"00;50;42;11","00;50;46;23","That's sort of a mega citation andthere's a huge amount of subsequent work."
"00;50;47;15","00;50;50;05","And predictive processingor predictive coding"
"00;50;50;19","00;50;54;07","is just looking at the relationshipfrom sense"
"00;50;54;20","00;50;57;24","to updatingof the generative model of sense."
"00;50;57;24","00;51;00;04","So it's a signal processing framework."
"00;51;00;04","00;51;03;17","And this is somethingI know that Dave is a big fan of us."
"00;51;03;17","00;51;04;28","You know, it's drills and hammers."
"00;51;04;28","00;51;09;28","And I know that Dave is a fan of talkingabout the signal processing"
"00;51;09;28","00;51;12;26","and the audioprocessing roots of active inference."
"00;51;13;19","00;51;18;18","So this is just on the inboundjust from sensory information"
"00;51;18;27","00;51;21;12","to estimates of that"
"00;51;21;26","00;51;25;29","generative model of that generativeprocess of the sensory data."
"00;51;26;28","00;51;28;28","The active inference framework"
"00;51;28;28","00;51;32;28","extends this account of predictiveprocessing to model motor control"
"00;51;33;12","00;51;37;09","and explains action selectionby appealing to the minimization"
"00;51;37;22","00;51;41;21","of divergence between predictedsensory data and actual sensory data."
"00;51;42;07","00;51;46;12","So each year we have the exact samedivergence minimization."
"00;51;46;27","00;51;48;11","It will sound better on the live stream."
"00;51;48;11","00;51;51;05","My Jesse colleagues, don't worry,"
"00;51;51;05","00;51;54;05","it's the same divergencethat's being minimized,"
"00;51;54;21","00;51;58;23","which is the difference between observedand expected sensory data."
"00;51;59;08","00;52;03;22","So in predictive processing,it's about sense and perceiving sense."
"00;52;03;28","00;52;07;01","And so you want to minimizethe divergence between what sensory"
"00;52;07;01","00;52;09;17","data you expectand what you're actually getting."
"00;52;10;06","00;52;13;14","But active inference has inference"
"00;52;13;25","00;52;16;07","planning as inference into the loop"
"00;52;17;01","00;52;19;13","and explains action selection"
"00;52;19;13","00;52;24;02","also in terms of the exact samedivergence goal of predictive processing,"
"00;52;24;16","00;52;28;12","which is again,to have your observed sensory outcomes"
"00;52;28;18","00;52;31;27","come into linewith your expected sensory outcomes. The"
"00;52;34;09","00;52;37;15","yeah, I one of the things I used to"
"00;52;38;23","00;52;43;07","share with people is so todayI'm wearing my murder of"
"00;52;43;11","00;52;47;01","of Crows t shirt because I used to studya lot of court behavior."
"00;52;47;17","00;52;50;03","And even though I work, there's,"
"00;52;51;02","00;52;53;29","there's still some questionas to what sort of"
"00;52;55;07","00;52;57;24","verbal cues there, what instructions"
"00;52;58;10","00;53;01;09","corporates are able to sharebecause they are social animals."
"00;53;01;09","00;53;05;16","And there they are problem solvers,but you don't have one Corbett standing"
"00;53;06;20","00;53;10;27","to the side as another of solvesa problem giving them instructions"
"00;53;11;12","00;53;13;20","so I think it's kind of interestingwhen we're"
"00;53;14;04","00;53;16;16","when we're lookingat this behavior question"
"00;53;17;13","00;53;20;14","whether we're the only speciesthat are actively inferring"
"00;53;21;07","00;53;21;23","because they think"
"00;53;21;23","00;53;24;26","that there are other species out therethat you can make a case that"
"00;53;25;15","00;53;28;12","they are doing that probably"
"00;53;29;11","00;53;32;18","form ofquestioning and answering as well."
"00;53;33;21","00;53;35;29","So yeah, it can be tools,"
"00;53;36;13","00;53;39;23","it can be based on onon social constructs"
"00;53;41;16","00;53;43;25","it can be based on caching."
"00;53;44;22","00;53;46;17","So deep memory."
"00;53;46;17","00;53;52;05","And again, there's a dependency,I think for behavior that uses"
"00;53;52;05","00;53;54;29","active inference to also have"
"00;53;55;24","00;53;58;15","some grounding in how and what."
"00;53;59;13","00;54;03;00","So I don't think that active inferencein and of itself"
"00;54;03;05","00;54;05;29","will allow us to, to"
"00;54;07;12","00;54;12;06","minimize anything unlesswe have the derivative and the accounts."
"00;54;12;16","00;54;16;01","So I think it'sI think it's it's a virtuous triad here."
"00;54;16;21","00;54;20;00","But I think what this paper istrying to do is get away from the idea"
"00;54;20;00","00;54;23;19","that all problems can be solvedwith only two kinds math"
"00;54;27;28","00;54;28;10","cool."
"00;54;28;10","00;54;30;11","Thank you, Stephen."
"00;54;32;03","00;54;32;12","Yeah."
"00;54;32;12","00;54;35;04","Further to that point arounds, you know,"
"00;54;36;03","00;54;39;16","what humans do or animals do ingeneral is"
"00;54;40;02","00;54;43;13","you could say optimal control approaches,maybe it's"
"00;54;43;13","00;54;47;16","only really humansthat can apply that extra level on top"
"00;54;48;01","00;54;52;07","as this kind of constrainingkind of deductive idea."
"00;54;52;07","00;54;57;09","And every every other organismis really working with this kind of flow."
"00;54;57;10","00;55;01;06","I mean, if you see a squirreltrying to run up a tree and between trees"
"00;55;01;06","00;55;05;00","and chase another schoolaround the trees, it's quite phenomenal"
"00;55;06;00","00;55;08;00","just how agile they are"
"00;55;08;03","00;55;10;20","and the speed they can work at and"
"00;55;11;25","00;55;15;09","so there's some sortof skillful performance that they've got."
"00;55;15;25","00;55;20;29","So there's this interest in thingwhereby you've got this."
"00;55;22;01","00;55;25;20","We see optimal controlas more straightforward,"
"00;55;26;22","00;55;30;11","but it basically it'salmost really optimal control"
"00;55;30;11","00;55;34;25","just isn't implementablein practical terms."
"00;55;34;25","00;55;38;29","It's almost it's a it's awhat you could say is non ergodic"
"00;55;39;03","00;55;43;05","deductive extrathat humans bring to the table"
"00;55;43;23","00;55;49;06","to explain the mechanical world thatthey're bringing to bear in some way."
"00;55;49;07","00;55;51;18","So it's kind of interestingjust happens to be"
"00;55;51;18","00;55;54;22","that was the first explanationwe had for this type of stuff."
"00;55;56;05","00;55;56;27","Nice."
"00;55;56;27","00;55;59;24","So let'sthink about what active inference is"
"00;55;59;24","00;56;02;23","and then see who might be doing itor what might be doing it."
"00;56;03;12","00;56;05;27","So again, the core idea is that"
"00;56;05;27","00;56;10;03","rather than selecting commandsthe organism in active inference"
"00;56;10;03","00;56;14;24","is inferring what it mustor should be doing under this same"
"00;56;14;24","00;56;19;14","imperative of predictive coding,which is to minimize the relationship,"
"00;56;20;04","00;56;23;28","minimize the divergence between observedand expected outcomes through time."
"00;56;24;20","00;56;27;00","Crucially,this brings perception and action"
"00;56;27;11","00;56;29;21","together in the same functional profile."
"00;56;30;09","00;56;34;02","We have them on a current sortof treating market,"
"00;56;34;02","00;56;38;04","almost like we can reduce our uncertaintythrough updating our model"
"00;56;38;09","00;56;40;14","and we reduce our uncertaintythrough action."
"00;56;40;20","00;56;45;27","So updating an action or actionand inference are put on common footing."
"00;56;46;22","00;56;48;06","And it also explains some."
"00;56;48;06","00;56;52;00","So this is the sort of computational listor algorithmic"
"00;56;52;00","00;56;55;11","level is we're making a sensorymotor model"
"00;56;55;21","00;56;59;03","that doesn't just have arrowsconnecting pieces ad hoc and say, look,"
"00;56;59;03","00;57;01;03","they're connectedbecause I drew a picture."
"00;57;01;03","00;57;06;15","We're bringing perceptionand action together in a common modeling"
"00;57;07;17","00;57;08;19","framework."
"00;57;08;21","00;57;12;15","And also on the neurological,it explains some of the similarities"
"00;57;12;15","00;57;15;04","between the functions of sensoryand motor cortices."
"00;57;15;16","00;57;19;07","So that speaks to Dean's points earlierand to a lot of these brain regions"
"00;57;19;07","00;57;20;20","that might have been discovered"
"00;57;20;20","00;57;24;26","or initially characterized as havinga more cognitive or a more motor role."
"00;57;24;26","00;57;25;17","But then it's shown"
"00;57;25;17","00;57;29;23","that they play other roles and so,you know, cue the endless clickbait."
"00;57;29;23","00;57;32;27","Oh, this brain region associated withthis also does that"
"00;57;33;26","00;57;35;04","should that be surprising?"
"00;57;35;04","00;57;38;14","Should that be salientor should we have another view"
"00;57;39;01","00;57;41;15","where that is to be expected?"
"00;57;41;15","00;57;44;06","Now, while this movefrom a problem of control,"
"00;57;44;17","00;57;48;02","so off to motor control,that's the action side."
"00;57;48;13","00;57;51;12","And then there's so pureaction side, optimal motor control"
"00;57;51;26","00;57;55;06","tends to not concern itselftoo much with uncertainty of measurement"
"00;57;55;06","00;57;56;25","or deep generative models."
"00;57;56;25","00;57;59;27","And then you have the pure sensoryprocessing side"
"00;57;59;28","00;58;02;07","that's kind of predictive processing."
"00;58;02;07","00;58;04;25","This move from a problem of controlto one, an inference"
"00;58;05;02","00;58;06;07","in terms of active inference."
"00;58;06;07","00;58;09;09","Does not make the problemmathematically easier in and of itself,"
"00;58;10;06","00;58;12;09","but it offers a different modelof skilled action"
"00;58;12;09","00;58;14;21","which respectsthe neurophysiological evidence."
"00;58;15;11","00;58;18;04","So in other words,we're taking the sort of problem"
"00;58;18;04","00;58;21;28","of going from sense datato a generative model,"
"00;58;22;06","00;58;26;25","the predictive processing model,and then the forward model from"
"00;58;27;27","00;58;30;05","internal states to action selection."
"00;58;30;29","00;58;34;16","And it's easier to, of course, subset"
"00;58;34;16","00;58;38;21","to just one of those directionsand say that one has a tractable model."
"00;58;39;15","00;58;43;10","But active inference is combiningboth directions"
"00;58;43;22","00;58;47;14","or integrating acrossthese two different ways"
"00;58;47;14","00;58;52;01","of looking at sense in action and sayingLet's have one model of sense in action"
"00;58;53;01","00;58;55;29","with a common functional profile"
"00;58;56;07","00;58;58;07","as they describe it here. Now,"
"00;58;59;16","00;59;02;00","which systems have it?"
"00;59;02;14","00;59;03;06","Do it?"
"00;59;03;15","00;59;07;06","That's the realism questionand the instrumental ISM question is"
"00;59;07;14","00;59;10;16","which systemscan we model as if they're doing this?"
"00;59;11;03","00;59;14;17","So I think that the instrumentalISM question, which as always,"
"00;59;14;17","00;59;18;13","it's about us, so it's easier to answeris the kinds of systems"
"00;59;18;19","00;59;22;16","that have sensory motorinput output dynamics."
"00;59;22;28","00;59;29;14","So everything from a self-driving carto different kinds of animals,"
"00;59;29;14","00;59;34;04","we could model as if they were gettinginput, generative model output."
"00;59;34;07","00;59;37;07","So the things that people model with OJ"
"00;59;37;18","00;59;40;13","or that thatclassical sandwich of cognition,"
"00;59;40;26","00;59;45;24","those are the kinds of systems that areapt to be models with active inference"
"00;59;46;09","00;59;49;23","the kinds of things that peoplewere modeling with optimal control"
"00;59;50;05","00;59;54;02","going from the model to actionand the kinds of systems that people"
"00;59;54;02","00;59;59;15","were modeling with predictive processingfrom sensory inputs to generative model."
"01;00;00;11","01;00;02;28","Both of those and onesthat especially are doing both,"
"01;00;03;06","01;00;08;01","those are some of the most amenablesystems for active inference. Even"
"01;00;10;04","01;00;10;29","you. I was wondering"
"01;00;10;29","01;00;15;14","this this idea of functional profile isI haven't heard that one before."
"01;00;15;14","01;00;19;07","Might be another one to think onthe ontology that's been talked about"
"01;00;19;29","01;00;23;07","how have you seenthat being used anywhere else"
"01;00;24;00","01;00;26;17","in terms of active inference,functional profile"
"01;00;30;12","01;00;31;27","good question."
"01;00;31;27","01;00;35;08","It doesn't seem likeit's used anywhere else in this paper."
"01;00;36;04","01;00;39;24","And I don't off hand recall"
"01;00;40;27","01;00;42;26","what other papersit might have been used in."
"01;00;42;26","01;00;44;03","But that's a great point."
"01;00;44;03","01;00;45;27","And I mean, to ask about,"
"01;00;46;03","01;00;49;03","I think the notion of just function"
"01;00;49;28","01;00;55;27","is a key one to follow and what what"
"01;00;57;05","01;00;58;26","how how do we follow function?"
"01;00;58;26","01;01;00;07","Yeah, go ahead. See."
"01;01;00;17","01;01;02;22","Yeah,I suppose because this is talking about"
"01;01;03;18","01;01;08;06","actions, skillful performancefunction starts to it's thinking"
"01;01;08;06","01;01;12;00","about the functionalways in how to achieve"
"01;01;12;29","01;01;15;16","an action of skill for performance."
"01;01;15;26","01;01;17;29","So maybe that's how it comes in here."
"01;01;17;29","01;01;21;07","Whereas a lot of some of the otherpapers, there's no moving parts,"
"01;01;21;07","01;01;21;26","so to speak."
"01;01;21;26","01;01;25;27","It's all informationbased, you know, in terms of"
"01;01;27;01","01;01;29;28","but I think it's, it's interestingin terms of"
"01;01;31;08","01;01;34;24","what that does or what it's trying to dois another way"
"01;01;34;24","01;01;38;24","of trying to speak to somethingwhich is a bit bigger."
"01;01;39;27","01;01;43;06","You know, that's one thing I've noticedis that inference"
"01;01;43;06","01;01;47;04","normally things are trying to definewhat everything is this one,"
"01;01;47;04","01;01;50;27","it gives these gives these pullbacksthe like,"
"01;01;50;27","01;01;54;23","OK, we've got a functional profilenow that allows us to"
"01;01;55;29","01;01;56;24","do X, Y, Z."
"01;01;56;24","01;02;00;03","But like I say, it doesprovide that challenge of trying to fit"
"01;02;00;03","01;02;03;07","that into these other pullbacksthat we've seen."
"01;02;03;07","01;02;06;08","So we keep finding that peer in like"
"01;02;06;21","01;02;11;00","in the effective chargethat came up in one."
"01;02;11;00","01;02;14;07","And so, yeah,I think that's a kind of an interesting"
"01;02;15;08","01;02;17;05","question about how"
"01;02;17;05","01;02;21;06","that fits in with other types of"
"01;02;22;13","01;02;27;08","modelsor ways of translating between spaces"
"01;02;27;08","01;02;30;16","or frameworks and"
"01;02;32;13","01;02;32;24","then."
"01;02;32;24","01;02;33;21","Thanks."
"01;02;34;09","01;02;36;28","Yeah. So I wonder,"
"01;02;36;28","01;02;40;27","so let's just take that to its,its next logical place."
"01;02;40;27","01;02;45;19","So let's start with a functional profile,not necessarily work back, but"
"01;02;46;05","01;02;48;26","is there some wayfor us to be able to identify"
"01;02;49;10","01;02;52;15","what's in that profilethat would allow for active inference?"
"01;02;52;15","01;02;56;17","And should we is that something thatthat is that dangerous"
"01;02;56;17","01;02;59;24","or is that legitimate"
"01;03;02;19","01;03;05;18","Nice question."
"01;03;06;15","01;03;09;12","There's a little bitwhere they're getting at this"
"01;03;09;12","01;03;12;15","realism and instrumental ism"
"01;03;12;15","01;03;13;21","discussion."
"01;03;14;04","01;03;16;29","So even some of the most forthrightdefenders"
"01;03;16;29","01;03;19;13","of the Active InferenceFramework Assemble"
"01;03;20;03","01;03;22;27","have backed awayfrom making such strongly realist claims"
"01;03;22;27","01;03;25;28","about the costly, efficaciouscharacter of generative model."
"01;03;26;12","01;03;27;25","So here is where we see"
"01;03;29;04","01;03;30;14","hardcore realism."
"01;03;30;14","01;03;34;01","So it's nice, you know, and as we worktowards the terms and the ontology,"
"01;03;34;10","01;03;36;13","how can we classify the different senses"
"01;03;37;14","01;03;39;18","or uses of terms"
"01;03;39;18","01;03;43;08","first in 2013 has advancedthe view that an agent does not have"
"01;03;43;08","01;03;46;07","a model of its world. It is a model"
"01;03;46;07","01;03;48;25","now that's an interesting claim,"
"01;03;49;28","01;03;51;28","but the authors bring this up"
"01;03;52;14","01;03;55;24","by also qualifying, for instance,use of model from a different paper"
"01;03;56;11","01;03;59;02","and saying crucially,if we accept the generative models"
"01;03;59;02","01;04;02;24","of the active inference frameworks,"
"01;04;02;27","01;04;04;09","not sure if this is"
"01;04;04;09","01;04;07;08","if they're sayingusually it's framework, but"
"01;04;07;24","01;04;11;11","will there be multiple active inferenceframeworks in line with these proposals?"
"01;04;11;11","01;04;14;14","We must embrace the ideathat generative models are causal in"
"01;04;14;14","01;04;18;11","the sense of an agent'sinactive attunement with the world rather"
"01;04;18;11","01;04;21;24","than part of the causal efficaciousmachinery used by an agent."
"01;04;23;15","01;04;27;14","So that's an interesting claim. Blue"
"01;04;28;22","01;04;30;07","So I was thinking about like,"
"01;04;30;07","01;04;34;12","you know, that an agent doesn't havea model of the world, but it is a model."
"01;04;34;12","01;04;37;25","And like I think about thatin terms of people that are that get"
"01;04;38;04","01;04;42;15","have traumatic brain injuryand then have like dramatic amnesia,"
"01;04;42;15","01;04;43;29","like can't remember how to walk"
"01;04;43;29","01;04;47;26","or talk or eat and have to like relearnall of these things."
"01;04;47;26","01;04;48;05","Right?"
"01;04;48;05","01;04;53;21","So, so I think about like if we don'tI mean, in that case, it seems like"
"01;04;53;21","01;04;58;00","the model like you have a modeland then you suddenly don't have a model."
"01;04;58;08","01;05;01;17","But it's like if you are a model,"
"01;05;01;17","01;05;03;08","are you suddenly not a model"
"01;05;03;08","01;05;07;03","or is your is that likea temporal disruption I don't know."
"01;05;07;03","01;05;08;12","Like so that that to me,"
"01;05;08;12","01;05;11;28","I mean and this is instrumentalistrealist debate, I realize."
"01;05;12;08","01;05;14;22","But where do youyou know, if you are a model,"
"01;05;14;22","01;05;17;19","is that like a temporal disruptionand suddenly you have to start over?"
"01;05;17;28","01;05;21;07","Or what does that look likein those circumstances?"
"01;05;22;02","01;05;23;08","Nice question, Steven."
"01;05;25;14","01;05;26;19","Yeah, I mean,"
"01;05;26;19","01;05;29;01","in a way,I suppose when someone has to rely on"
"01;05;30;24","01;05;33;11","the fact that they are at some level"
"01;05;33;11","01;05;36;18","their body is part of being that modelthat gives them"
"01;05;37;23","01;05;39;27","access to either"
"01;05;40;15","01;05;45;14","some fires or they call itthe morphological computing capacity,"
"01;05;45;14","01;05;48;16","the body's capacity to thenform those priors because"
"01;05;51;05","01;05;51;23","you know, if"
"01;05;51;23","01;05;54;14","if however, certain parts of the body are"
"01;05;55;16","01;05;58;16","like with a stroke,that can be kind of challenging"
"01;05;58;16","01;06;03;18","because that maybe the actual waythe body moves is compromised."
"01;06;03;18","01;06;08;26","Therefore, the ability to use it torecreate is is diminished."
"01;06;08;26","01;06;12;09","I mean, the questionof how much it's diminished then becomes"
"01;06;12;29","01;06;16;08","I don't know if anyone could quantifythat, but it's interesting."
"01;06;17;03","01;06;18;03","It's a good point."
"01;06;18;03","01;06;21;03","It instrumentalist would say well,you know, the brain isn't, you know,"
"01;06;21;04","01;06;22;26","per se doing active inference."
"01;06;22;26","01;06;24;11","We're going to model it as such."
"01;06;24;11","01;06;27;00","But then when there is an injuryto the physical system,"
"01;06;28;01","01;06;32;00","then we say, oh, we're stilljust modeling it with active inference."
"01;06;32;00","01;06;33;23","We're just changing our activeinference model."
"01;06;33;23","01;06;36;27","Or has the actual system itself changed?"
"01;06;37;13","01;06;41;08","So will we just always say thateven when the system changes"
"01;06;42;05","01;06;44;05","in the physical world,"
"01;06;45;06","01;06;48;07","we're just going to update our modeland just always stay in"
"01;06;48;07","01;06;49;11","the instrumentalist and land?"
"01;06;49;11","01;06;52;29","Or are there timeswhere changes in the world"
"01;06;53;14","01;06;56;26","make the instrumental ism vergeinto realism as if it's actually"
"01;06;56;26","01;07;01;16","describing something about the worldthat's going to be a very delicate walk."
"01;07;03;15","01;07;07;02","And they they are arguing that again,"
"01;07;07;02","01;07;12;05","if we think about these generative modelsas purely formal and epistemic tools."
"01;07;12;21","01;07;16;00","So just like a linear regression,you know, you can do a linear"
"01;07;16;00","01;07;20;03","regression on GDPor on some other feature."
"01;07;20;03","01;07;22;10","You can do aT test in a double blind study."
"01;07;22;10","01;07;24;10","It doesn't make the people a T test."
"01;07;24;16","01;07;26;29","It doesn't make the GDP a linear model."
"01;07;27;05","01;07;29;19","So it doesn't make somethingactive inference"
"01;07;30;01","01;07;32;27","just to use itin this statistical framework."
"01;07;33;15","01;07;36;06","That's what'smeant by the formal and epistemic tools."
"01;07;37;06","01;07;40;01","Then thisframework is, we argue, compatible"
"01;07;40;01","01;07;43;12","with a sensory motor approachto understanding skilled action."
"01;07;45;09","01;07;48;17","It's interesting to mebecause the sensory motor approach"
"01;07;48;17","01;07;52;16","to understanding skilled action itselfcould have a realist or an interpreter"
"01;07;52;16","01;07;54;09","or an instrumentalist approach."
"01;07;54;09","01;07;56;13","The instrumentalist sensorymotor would say,"
"01;07;56;13","01;07;58;29","I'm not even sayingthe system has sense in action."
"01;07;59;04","01;08;02;01","I'm just saying we could model itas if it had sense in action,"
"01;08;02;14","01;08;06;15","whereas the realism of sensorymotor would say, this system actually"
"01;08;06;15","01;08;09;01","does have sensory and active components"
"01;08;15;10","01;08;18;04","and also this is another important note."
"01;08;18;10","01;08;21;20","The sensory motor view reflectsa spectrum of ideas,"
"01;08;22;06","01;08;24;20","which includes simple open loop sensory"
"01;08;24;20","01;08;27;06","motor correlations, closed loop"
"01;08;28;24","01;08;33;17","systems, regularities given a goal,and optimal sets of regularities"
"01;08;33;17","01;08;36;04","according to a certain performancemetrics."
"01;08;36;22","01;08;40;27","These can be understood using the toolsof dynamical models of cognition,"
"01;08;41;23","01;08;44;08","capturing the brain, body environment,interactions"
"01;08;44;08","01;08;47;13","in terms of dynamical systems,as opposed to assuming"
"01;08;47;13","01;08;50;02","the agentis involved in symbolic computation."
"01;08;50;24","01;08;53;23","So it's almost likewe see a lot of separation of"
"01;08;55;16","01;08;58;28","the isolationof agency or the delineation of agents"
"01;08;59;10","01;09;02;12","with agents in the nicheand the niche itself."
"01;09;02;12","01;09;06;01","So we see like agent and externalinternal states and external states."
"01;09;06;16","01;09;10;06","And now when we think about brainand body, that's one"
"01;09;10;14","01;09;13;25","sort of inseparable dyad, and then it is"
"01;09;13;25","01;09;16;10","also inseparable from the niche."
"01;09;16;25","01;09;20;18","So how are we going to take all thesedynamical systems which have different"
"01;09;21;03","01;09;25;12","physical and causal connectionsamong them brain, body"
"01;09;25;12","01;09;30;03","and niche and work towards a frameworkthat's actually going to"
"01;09;31;05","01;09;34;19","say what we want to say and be usefulfor what we want to do with these kinds"
"01;09;34;19","01;09;39;08","of models, like reducing uncertaintyabout how organisms will act"
"01;09;39;18","01;09;43;07","or designing environmentsthat work for different sorts of agents."
"01;09;44;04","01;09;45;29","How are we going to do that effectively?"
"01;09;47;08","01;09;47;26","And drawing"
"01;09;47;26","01;09;50;18","from what we know about dynamical systemsmore broadly,"
"01;09;50;28","01;09;55;05","rather than bring on assumptionssuch as that, the agent is performing"
"01;09;55;05","01;09;59;04","symbolic computation, which comes alongwith the constructionism"
"01;09;59;06","01;10;01;16","and the representation ismand all these other pieces."
"01;10;01;19","01;10;02;14","Stephen"
"01;10;04;05","01;10;09;19","you know, this is a useful sentence hereto show that dynamic that's happening"
"01;10;09;19","01;10;14;03","between the kind of participatory sensemaking world"
"01;10;14;24","01;10;17;01","and the sort of in activists"
"01;10;17;15","01;10;21;28","and the inactive inference world"
"01;10;23;07","01;10;26;11","because there's there'sthese useful distinctions"
"01;10;26;11","01;10;30;27","that have been coming up in an activismand this participatory sense making,"
"01;10;31;28","01;10;34;14","yet they struggle to give the ways"
"01;10;34;14","01;10;38;00","to actually calculatehow that comes about outside"
"01;10;38;00","01;10;42;05","of these kind of metrics that are lookingfrom the outside of the system."
"01;10;42;09","01;10;48;15","So this this is kind of quite a dancethat's going on,"
"01;10;48;15","01;10;53;16","but it seems to be yielding some goodprogress facts of inference because"
"01;10;54;21","01;10;56;19","they're laying some of the grounds"
"01;10;56;19","01;11;00;02","for active inference tothen see what could be plausibly"
"01;11;01;04","01;11;02;08","modeled"
"01;11;02;24","01;11;04;20","so that's quite useful."
"01;11;04;20","01;11;04;28","Yeah."
"01;11;04;28","01;11;07;17","Another point to thatand also what you said"
"01;11;08;09","01;11;09;10","earlier"
"01;11;11;11","01;11;14;03","they're suggesting that active inferenceis going to extend"
"01;11;14;14","01;11;18;08","costly linear accounts of motor control,which tend to focus"
"01;11;18;08","01;11;21;18","on the contingency between new actionsand their consequences."
"01;11;22;02","01;11;24;23","So the loop there,which is hardly a loop, it's"
"01;11;24;23","01;11;28;01","actuallya line goes from action selection"
"01;11;28;19","01;11;33;17","to a new state like I want, you know,I want to grasp the coffee cup,"
"01;11;34;04","01;11;38;17","how am I going to graspI grasped that is the domain"
"01;11;38;17","01;11;42;09","of many previous modelswhich is like from some sort of delta"
"01;11;42;18","01;11;46;16","that needs to be accomplishedto achieving that action."
"01;11;46;16","01;11;48;02","And that's where the model ends."
"01;11;49;16","01;11;52;15","Active inference, in fact, proposesa complimentary view"
"01;11;52;21","01;11;56;02","where predictions of expectedproprioceptive states"
"01;11;56;18","01;11;59;21","are not just seen as passive reactionsto new motor signals"
"01;12;00;02","01;12;04;08","like in the Coffee Cup Drive example,but as also triggering"
"01;12;04;09","01;12;07;28","adjustable dynamic reflex arcsto generate new actions."
"01;12;08;07","01;12;13;02","So here instead of starting from actionto a new proprioceptive state,"
"01;12;13;14","01;12;17;18","like I want to be in a different state,so I want to select an action."
"01;12;17;18","01;12;19;15","OK, now my elbow is in the correct"
"01;12;19;15","01;12;23;07","predicted Proprioceptive State,so we're good to go here."
"01;12;23;20","01;12;28;03","We're starting with the updatingof our Proprioceptive State"
"01;12;28;22","01;12;31;15","moving to action selection,"
"01;12;31;15","01;12;33;05","inferring our state."
"01;12;33;05","01;12;36;27","So action and inferencelike the two stroke engine"
"01;12;37;10","01;12;39;28","are now working together in a way where"
"01;12;39;28","01;12;42;10","we can pull out a little local stretch"
"01;12;43;00","01;12;45;16","that has the same functional features"
"01;12;46;00","01;12;48;20","as this linear causative model above,"
"01;12;49;08","01;12;51;18","because there's going to be some stretch"
"01;12;52;00","01;12;54;28","where that action was performed"
"01;12;54;28","01;12;57;13","and where the functional characteristicswere carried out"
"01;12;57;29","01;13;04;00","but we're embedding that in a deeptemporal model, and the temporal"
"01;13;04;00","01;13;08;28","depth of this model confers a more activeanticipatory role to proprioception"
"01;13;09;22","01;13;12;07","now seen in a constantly circular model"
"01;13;12;19","01;13;14;24","in linewith the inactive and embodied approach."
"01;13;15;19","01;13;17;29","So that's that sort of rummaging around"
"01;13;17;29","01;13;23;08","that gives an anticipatoryand active role for proprioception,"
"01;13;23;20","01;13;27;03","not just a state estimate rolefor proprioception"
"01;13;27;07","01;13;30;00","so that it can get relayedto the central headquarters,"
"01;13;30;24","01;13;33;10","transmutedand sent back as an instruction."
"01;13;33;20","01;13;38;05","It's not like a central intelligencemodel of action selection."
"01;13;38;22","01;13;42;09","It's like an anticipatorydeep temporal model"
"01;13;42;19","01;13;47;08","that allows sense to be doing somethingslightly different Stephen."
"01;13;50;05","01;13;51;19","Just a question when it says"
"01;13;51;19","01;13;54;23","and so it says new actions, a new actionin active inference"
"01;13;54;23","01;13;57;19","is the new"
"01;13;57;24","01;14;01;15","well guess I suppose, of whatthe action state is."
"01;14;02;07","01;14;05;02","And then the new Proprioceptive State."
"01;14;05;20","01;14;06;16","This is interesting thing."
"01;14;06;16","01;14;12;02","We proprioception isis that almost a guess as well"
"01;14;12;04","01;14;15;13","like based on a mix of"
"01;14;15;13","01;14;19;15","sort of introspective data and"
"01;14;20;29","01;14;24;04","other data or data about other ways?"
"01;14;24;10","01;14;27;28","So is it like a a different types of"
"01;14;29;01","01;14;32;17","gas in or is one of them action one's"
"01;14;33;01","01;14;36;09","still been seen this perceptionin that loop"
"01;14;38;17","01;14;39;23","good question."
"01;14;39;23","01;14;41;29","I'm sure there's a lot of waysto go about it."
"01;14;42;05","01;14;47;25","But one thought is even perceptionis inference that's predictive coding."
"01;14;48;04","01;14;52;28","So our visual perceptionis clearly a generated inference."
"01;14;52;28","01;14;54;03","There's no blind spot."
"01;14;54;03","01;14;57;09","There's resolution in colorin the periphery where we know"
"01;14;57;09","01;15;01;02","the anatomy of the eyedoesn't directly support that and so on."
"01;15;01;09","01;15;04;10","There's smoothness even though our eyesare constantly secreting."
"01;15;04;27","01;15;09;20","So whether it's appropriate scepteror whether it's visual input"
"01;15;10;06","01;15;15;04","that is also inferredas part of the deep generative model."
"01;15;15;22","01;15;19;01","And so when there is ambiguous visual"
"01;15;19;01","01;15;22;19","input or ambiguous proprioceptive input,for example,"
"01;15;23;07","01;15;25;12","that inactive inference"
"01;15;25;22","01;15;28;10","is an opportunityfor uncertainty reduction."
"01;15;28;25","01;15;32;19","Rather than getting out over our skis,we then saying"
"01;15;32;19","01;15;36;02","whether that's a valuableor an E or a less valuable state"
"01;15;36;22","01;15;42;00","we actually don't need to judge the valuein a scalar framework"
"01;15;42;13","01;15;45;02","of ambiguous versus unambiguous states"
"01;15;45;25","01;15;49;08","because we can just pursueuncertainty, reduction,"
"01;15;49;15","01;15;53;03","and then also cast planning as inference"
"01;15;53;11","01;15;57;17","and perception as inferencedoes that make sense even then?"
"01;15;58;00","01;15;59;17","Yeah, that's that's really useful."
"01;15;59;17","01;16;03;02","And I think like what you're sayingthere, that also brings in the,"
"01;16;03;09","01;16;05;06","the idea of temporal scale."
"01;16;05;06","01;16;08;27","So there's with visionand with this, there's what's going on"
"01;16;10;14","01;16;11;16","below"
"01;16;11;22","01;16;15;10","greater speeds and flux than we can know."
"01;16;15;10","01;16;19;05","Like the scales and the way those recordsthen get put together to be"
"01;16;19;14","01;16;24;18","this kind of joined upsmooth perception of vision and"
"01;16;26;01","01;16;29;02","this this is this new action, newProprioceptive state"
"01;16;29;03","01;16;33;10","that's almost kind ofat the speed of everyday awareness."
"01;16;33;28","01;16;38;07","And once things become longer and happenover the period of like 10 minutes"
"01;16;38;17","01;16;42;03","intervals, you can no longer track that"
"01;16;42;03","01;16;46;20","in your work in memory or your workin phenomenological consciousness."
"01;16;47;00","01;16;51;07","So this is kind of like the Goldilockszone in a way where we're able to"
"01;16;52;04","01;16;55;06","when it's talking about act, new action,new proprioceptive states, it's"
"01;16;55;06","01;16;57;29","kind of sits in that kind of"
"01;16;59;14","01;17;01;10","an averaged out"
"01;17;01;10","01;17;05;23","perceptual awarenessin a way that we can engage."
"01;17;07;11","01;17;10;21","Interesting point blue."
"01;17;10;23","01;17;11;02","Yeah."
"01;17;11;02","01;17;14;14","Then you already like kind of saidI was going to say right after Stephen"
"01;17;14;14","01;17;19;23","but proprioception really isis the expectation like where do I expect"
"01;17;19;23","01;17;24;17","my body to be where likeinstead of asking like where is my leg?"
"01;17;24;17","01;17;27;02","It's like,where is my leg supposed to be?"
"01;17;27;02","01;17;29;10","Or Where do I think my leg actually is?"
"01;17;29;19","01;17;31;06","And you're not always right. Right."
"01;17;31;06","01;17;33;06","Like in the phantom limb"
"01;17;33;06","01;17;37;20","case and even like, you know,if you're stuck with a pin, right?"
"01;17;37;20","01;17;39;13","Like soand this is not appropriate reception,"
"01;17;39;13","01;17;42;01","this is just generallylike where your nerves are."
"01;17;42;01","01;17;44;09","So some in some placesthey're very close together."
"01;17;44;16","01;17;48;28","And you can infer with great accuracywhere exactly the pin was poked into you."
"01;17;49;03","01;17;53;08","But in some other places in your body,the nerves are more far apart"
"01;17;53;16","01;17;56;21","and so you can't tell even if the nerveeven if two pins,"
"01;17;56;22","01;18;00;06","you put a pin here, you poke a pin here,you touch the same place."
"01;18;00;06","01;18;02;28","It's like the pin is here,but you're not always right."
"01;18;02;28","01;18;08;06","So so there's there's this inference thatthat happens in proprioception as well."
"01;18;09;17","01;18;09;29","Nice."
"01;18;09;29","01;18;12;17","It's like there's one mode"
"01;18;13;02","01;18;17;12","where you have a very high confidenceprior of where your arm is located."
"01;18;17;12","01;18;19;27","You know, it's right by my side,let's just say."
"01;18;20;10","01;18;24;02","And when there's a high confidenceprior data"
"01;18;24;02","01;18;28;01","that don't support that priorare only going to move it slightly."
"01;18;28;12","01;18;31;11","If someone's very convincedthat something is the case,"
"01;18;32;02","01;18;34;05","they say it's 100%the case, that this is this way."
"01;18;34;05","01;18;37;22","Well, then, you know, there's no point inproviding alternative evidence"
"01;18;37;22","01;18;41;10","because they're going to see itin terms of their prior."
"01;18;41;21","01;18;45;02","So in that case of the phantom limb,it's like there's a high"
"01;18;45;14","01;18;48;13","precision priorthat the limb is in a certain location."
"01;18;48;24","01;18;52;12","In fact, it's such a strong priorthat sensory data"
"01;18;52;25","01;18;56;22","like proprioceptive data that your armsin a different place or visual data that,"
"01;18;57;07","01;18;59;13","for example,somebody no longer has that limb"
"01;19;00;13","01;19;03;12","still doesn't manageto update the experience"
"01;19;03;19","01;19;05;23","or the generative model of the limbbeing there."
"01;19;05;24","01;19;09;18","So that's one case that we can framein an active inference way."
"01;19;10;04","01;19;12;15","And another case would be likewhere's my leg?"
"01;19;12;15","01;19;14;22","I have low confidence."
"01;19;14;22","01;19;18;05","And now instead of framing this just as a"
"01;19;18;23","01;19;22;02","estimate that there's an uncertainty on,and then we're going"
"01;19;22;02","01;19;26;26","to have to tag a value onwe go from that estimate with uncertainty"
"01;19;27;12","01;19;31;12","to planning as inference,what motor control"
"01;19;31;18","01;19;35;12","or what motor behavior is going to reduceuncertainty on the leg."
"01;19;35;27","01;19;38;09","And sometimes that's like looking at it,"
"01;19;38;20","01;19;41;28","other times it butthat's a motor behavior with the eyes."
"01;19;42;09","01;19;45;01","Other times it might be doing a motion"
"01;19;45;14","01;19;48;29","that thenlike kind of gives us some sensor data."
"01;19;49;12","01;19;52;02","So it's kind of like checking your phoneand seeing like what"
"01;19;52;02","01;19;54;13","notifications are therewhen you're uncertain."
"01;19;54;13","01;19;56;23","Maybe sometimes like a shakeor something like that."
"01;19;56;23","01;20;01;05","It's like just reactivatinga bunch of sensors just to pass"
"01;20;01;20","01;20;04;25","say, Oh, yep, we're here just checkingin, reducing your uncertainty."
"01;20;05;10","01;20;09;16","And so the state estimate,even when there is uncertainty about it,"
"01;20;10;00","01;20;14;10","we can reduce that uncertaintythrough action selection"
"01;20;14;25","01;20;17;24","rather than just being trappedin a framework of like,"
"01;20;18;03","01;20;19;21","OK, I'm not sure where it is"
"01;20;19;21","01;20;22;08","and now I'm not surewhether that's rewarding or not,"
"01;20;22;18","01;20;25;18","and now I'm not sure which path to takethat's going to be most rewarding."
"01;20;26;29","01;20;28;02","We don't go down the"
"01;20;28;02","01;20;31;27","reward rabbit holebecause there's a deep generative model"
"01;20;32;18","01;20;35;18","and for evolved slash"
"01;20;35;20","01;20;40;17","created or whatever organismsthose priors are fit."
"01;20;41;13","01;20;45;01","So it's not just like we're dealingwith the space of all possible"
"01;20;45;01","01;20;46;17","generative models."
"01;20;46;17","01;20;49;04","These have been evolutionarily selected"
"01;20;49;12","01;20;53;10","to be functionalin our physical constraints,"
"01;20;53;10","01;20;58;01","but underwateror in a different gravity space."
"01;20;58;01","01;21;01;27","It'd be a different set of priorsthat would need to be"
"01;21;03;06","01;21;05;20","learned or utilized"
"01;21;07;16","01;21;10;22","in our last piece here."
"01;21;10;22","01;21;15;27","What what do you think weresome of the big pieces that we leave this"
"01;21;16;06","01;21;20;14","23 strange attractorwith as we move forward?"
"01;21;20;14","01;21;22;19","Like what kinds of"
"01;21;23;04","01;21;26;02","distinctions or insights here"
"01;21;26;03","01;21;29;17","do we want to see how they applyin different settings."
"01;21;29;25","01;21;31;09","Dean and then anyone else."
"01;21;33;26","01;21;34;15","OK so"
"01;21;34;15","01;21;37;25","this is going to me a strange twistbut that's that's OK."
"01;21;38;11","01;21;40;17","So I came away from the paper"
"01;21;41;00","01;21;43;26","and I thought aboutsome of the things that"
"01;21;44;27","01;21;46;09","Casper did bring up."
"01;21;46;09","01;21;49;10","Casper did bring up in terms of so"
"01;21;49;16","01;21;52;05","so what happens when"
"01;21;52;16","01;21;55;22","when we talk to instruction,it's like instructors are all around us."
"01;21;55;22","01;21;56;07","There's people"
"01;21;56;07","01;21;59;20","that spend a great deal of their lifepreparing to become an instructor."
"01;22;00;07","01;22;02;28","And we come along and say,"
"01;22;02;28","01;22;04;29","Yeah, that's great, we know what you do,"
"01;22;06;04","01;22;08;17","but we're going to kind of,"
"01;22;08;19","01;22;11;13","I don't know, maybe bring you down a pegbecause we've been introduced"
"01;22;11;13","01;22;16;02","this other stuff that you weren't askedto sort of train yourself up on."
"01;22;16;02","01;22;19;15","And I'm not sureif that's a threat or not."
"01;22;19;15","01;22;23;14","And I guess it depends on the personnow that I hear the ideas introduced to."
"01;22;23;15","01;22;25;14","But I'll bring a bring a"
"01;22;28;10","01;22;28;23","if you"
"01;22;28;23","01;22;31;20","know, the movie is Independence Dayand Thelma and Louise,"
"01;22;32;22","01;22;36;16","I'm going to bring those intoand kind of into a juxtaposition here."
"01;22;36;26","01;22;40;10","I think for the instrumentalists"
"01;22;41;25","01;22;44;19","they don't necessarilysee that there can be"
"01;22;45;02","01;22;48;18","for the personwho is living out the adversarial Greek"
"01;22;48;18","01;22;52;14","myth that's against the aliensor that's against the"
"01;22;52;29","01;22;56;23","the people who are chasing us down andtrying to get our our convertible back"
"01;22;58;00","01;22;58;26","there, isn't it?"
"01;22;58;26","01;23;03;29","There is no set of instructionsper say that those people want to follow."
"01;23;03;29","01;23;06;24","They're living the interaction is state"
"01;23;09;08","01;23;10;17","and you could start out with kick"
"01;23;10;17","01;23;14;02","the tires and light the firesall Harry Connick Jr."
"01;23;14;15","01;23;19;03","And still end up in a rapid decelerationmoment ala"
"01;23;19;21","01;23;22;16","susan sarandon and geena davis."
"01;23;23;02","01;23;26;12","And I think for peoplewho are going to look at this problem"
"01;23;26;25","01;23;31;01","in terms of how do we introducethis interaction ism in a way"
"01;23;31;14","01;23;35;25","that doesn't threaten thetop down hardness of how most"
"01;23;37;23","01;23;40;11","most situations where we want people"
"01;23;40;11","01;23;45;10","to be able to take up as an embodiedskill, skillful performance"
"01;23;45;21","01;23;49;21","without putting them in a situationwhere they"
"01;23;51;15","01;23;55;00","behave like aliensor behave like police, chasing"
"01;23;55;00","01;23;58;16","somebody down with a helicopterwe're going to have to sort of"
"01;23;59;11","01;24;01;21","I don't know I don't knowif it's a slow rolling."
"01;24;01;21","01;24;04;17","I'm not sure exactly what it is."
"01;24;04;17","01;24;07;05","But those peoplewho are now currently instructors"
"01;24;07;06","01;24;10;22","and instructional lists by by profession,"
"01;24;11;10","01;24;15;04","we're going to haveto give them something so that they don't"
"01;24;15;22","01;24;18;14","cling desperately to a model"
"01;24;18;14","01;24;22;17","that I thinkthe authors of this paper demonstrate."
"01;24;22;21","01;24;24;22","It requires a rethink."
"01;24;24;22","01;24;28;11","I don't think we throw outinstructional ism but I absolutely do"
"01;24;28;11","01;24;31;22","think that it's it's placeon the top of the mountain."
"01;24;32;05","01;24;34;19","And now all these little robotsclimbing up it,"
"01;24;35;11","01;24;37;22","that that has to be reviewedand revisited."
"01;24;38;11","01;24;41;23","And so, I mean, as a go forward,I don't know how"
"01;24;41;23","01;24;45;13","we put people in a place where they'recomfortable with that kind of"
"01;24;47;09","01;24;49;25","I don't want to say it's disruptive,but I think it is."
"01;24;50;11","01;24;52;24","But I think we have to be ableto come at this in a way"
"01;24;53;05","01;24;57;12","that doesn't make them sort of circlethe wagons solenoid annoyingly"
"01;24;57;26","01;25;02;01","and try to protect somethingthat obviously is"
"01;25;02;01","01;25;05;11","is up for a bit of evolutionbefore a revolution."
"01;25;07;01","01;25;09;14","Nice points there, Stephen."
"01;25;11;13","01;25;13;08","Yeah, I like that idea."
"01;25;13;08","01;25;13;18","Yeah."
"01;25;13;18","01;25;19;03","This challenge of having this mountainthat we've kind of ascended"
"01;25;19;12","01;25;22;16","and placethese optimal control theories on."
"01;25;23;02","01;25;26;22","And maybe it's more like there'sa mountain"
"01;25;27;13","01;25;31;02","of active inferenceand there's a there's a little rock,"
"01;25;31;19","01;25;34;29","a rock structure on the top,which is up to control theory,"
"01;25;34;29","01;25;39;13","which we're able to sort of utilizeon top of that, you know,"
"01;25;39;27","01;25;46;13","but it's it's a lot more ricketyand it's not the, the main game in town."
"01;25;46;18","01;25;50;08","You know, the main game isour intuition, our dynamical"
"01;25;52;04","01;25;53;14","balancing of all these"
"01;25;53;14","01;25;56;13","different energy parameters."
"01;25;57;09","01;26;01;02","But we doand particularly humans have this ability"
"01;26;01;08","01;26;03;28","to impose this extra"
"01;26;05;21","01;26;08;18","shack of tools on the top"
"01;26;09;01","01;26;12;02","that we now thinkis the main game in town."
"01;26;13;13","01;26;14;01","Nice."
"01;26;14;01","01;26;17;12","So to Stephen's then to Dean's point, so"
"01;26;17;28","01;26;22;06","as to which one's the mountain,which one's the mole hill,"
"01;26;22;06","01;26;26;01","which one's the anthill here,Kristen says optimal"
"01;26;26;01","01;26;29;11","control can be cast as active inferencewith three simplifications"
"01;26;29;28","01;26;34;00","so as we increasingly clarifyour understanding"
"01;26;34;00","01;26;35;15","of these different models,"
"01;26;35;15","01;26;39;15","we'll be able to seewhich models are nested within one"
"01;26;39;15","01;26;43;00","anotheror are alternate framings of one another"
"01;26;43;10","01;26;48;29","or are more overlapping than different,or what are those key distinctions"
"01;26;49;07","01;26;51;24","or what are the variableswhere you can expand it to three"
"01;26;51;24","01;26;54;14","and all of a suddenyou've gone from Model A to B? So"
"01;26;55;15","01;26;56;18","remains to be seen."
"01;26;56;18","01;26;59;10","And by"
"01;26;59;16","01;27;02;24","him saying that optimal controlis a thrice"
"01;27;02;24","01;27;06;10","simplified act of inferencealong these three specific domains,"
"01;27;06;29","01;27;11;13","it does suggest that the bigger picturemight be active inference,"
"01;27;11;20","01;27;15;12","and then you get special caseoptimal motor control"
"01;27;15;12","01;27;19;19","with a value functionas a derivative model"
"01;27;20;02","01;27;22;22","within an active inference universe,"
"01;27;22;28","01;27;25;01","even if these other models were developedfirst."
"01;27;25;01","01;27;29;25","That's often the case that a certainmodel is introduced and then it's later"
"01;27;29;25","01;27;33;23","generalized in several ways,so that in the future it's actually seen"
"01;27;33;23","01;27;37;21","as a special case model,even though it's actually at one point."
"01;27;37;21","01;27;41;22","It was the only game in town,certainly for a lot of biology models."
"01;27;41;22","01;27;42;24","That's the case."
"01;27;42;24","01;27;45;06","And then, Dean,I really like this idea of like"
"01;27;45;29","01;27;48;05","there's a job title called An Instructor."
"01;27;48;13","01;27;52;00","And if somebody says I'm an instructorin, you know,"
"01;27;52;15","01;27;54;25","organic chemistry or in tango"
"01;27;55;03","01;27;57;09","baseball,people know what you're talking about."
"01;27;57;25","01;28;02;21","So how could interactionism be so broadly"
"01;28;03;11","01;28;05;26","participated in that?"
"01;28;05;26","01;28;10;19","People say, I'm an interactor I'ma baseball interactor, I'm an Interactor."
"01;28;11;22","01;28;14;06","Maybethe job would be called that or not."
"01;28;14;06","01;28;18;17","So how do we, like you were saying,not kind of threaten"
"01;28;18;26","01;28;21;29","or disrupt their modes, but"
"01;28;22;12","01;28;25;08","give a yesand for what they're working on and"
"01;28;26;11","01;28;29;13","maybe part of it is that the interactor,"
"01;28;30;08","01;28;35;05","it's like reframing their interactionswith their student, but just say"
"01;28;35;20","01;28;39;01","as a cultural scaffoldingof an interaction"
"01;28;39;04","01;28;41;15","that doesn't make ita symmetric interaction."
"01;28;42;06","01;28;45;08","It's culturally scaffolded moments"
"01;28;45;25","01;28;48;05","of Bayesian model updating."
"01;28;48;21","01;28;51;23","And so it's like, yes,you do give instructions."
"01;28;51;23","01;28;56;05","That's the verbal term for what you saywhen you say pull or breathe or OK,"
"01;28;56;06","01;28;57;10","slow down."
"01;28;57;10","01;28;58;28","You can still give instructions."
"01;28;58;28","01;29;01;19","We're not saying thatthat is not part of your toolkit,"
"01;29;02;14","01;29;04;21","but let's more broadly"
"01;29;04;21","01;29;08;18","look at your interactionswith this dynamical system"
"01;29;10;04","01;29;13;29","as doing what you want to do"
"01;29;14;25","01;29;19;07","and maybe it'd be enough just to pushthem to that edges of the hill"
"01;29;19;24","01;29;24;07","and just say interactionsare a broader way than instructions,"
"01;29;24;07","01;29;28;03","which you want to reduce everythingyou do to just barking instructions,"
"01;29;28;18","01;29;31;08","or sometimes you lead by example."
"01;29;31;19","01;29;37;14","Other times you show wordlesslyyou don't need to frame your interactions"
"01;29;37;14","01;29;42;11","as instructions, recognize that you'rejust dynamical interacting systems."
"01;29;42;26","01;29;46;03","And this"
"01;29;46;03","01;29;48;14","a lot of peopleare working on a framework that suggests"
"01;29;48;22","01;29;51;12","that this is a broader wayof thinking about training"
"01;29;51;26","01;29;56;04","and might be able to help you on one handwith a high performance elements"
"01;29;56;15","01;29;59;28","and on the other hand with accessibilityand in making your work"
"01;29;59;28","01;30;01;12","more communicable."
"01;30;01;12","01;30;03;25","Not sure about that, of course,but just one way to go."
"01;30;03;28","01;30;04;11","Stephen"
"01;30;06;23","01;30;07;20","Yeah."
"01;30;07;23","01;30;10;10","With the idea of roles and how people"
"01;30;11;09","01;30;16;01","look at performance in roles,this really comes back to coaching again."
"01;30;16;01","01;30;19;20","I mentioned that earlier is,you know, coaching came out of"
"01;30;19;20","01;30;22;06","the need to supervise therapists"
"01;30;22;28","01;30;26;17","and how they could be guidedin their path"
"01;30;26;17","01;30;29;12","as they were supposedlyhelping the people that were needy."
"01;30;30;05","01;30;31;26","They needed guidance."
"01;30;31;26","01;30;34;21","And that same idea now of coaching"
"01;30;34;21","01;30;39;00","rather than teaching or instruct in."
"01;30;39;17","01;30;42;01","And while they have their"
"01;30;42;01","01;30;45;16","role is given the formal documentsthat you might need"
"01;30;45;16","01;30;49;20","and provides in the biggernarrative and given certain tools,"
"01;30;50;05","01;30;54;26","you know, you, youwithin that there's this idea of OK,"
"01;30;55;13","01;30;58;14","what types of developmentalor performance"
"01;31;00;08","01;31;04;06","interactionscan be nurtured and cultivated"
"01;31;04;18","01;31;07;01","and I think this actually really"
"01;31;07;07","01;31;09;28","can tie in to the kind of pragmatist"
"01;31;10;14","01;31;14;07","social constructivist approachesthat coaching is trying to work with."
"01;31;14;08","01;31;16;22","As in, but it gives it a bit more"
"01;31;18;17","01;31;20;23","it does actually give it a bit more meat"
"01;31;20;23","01;31;23;18","without becoming too complex,which I think previously"
"01;31;23;18","01;31;25;27","a lot of the active inferenceis maybe a bit too abstract."
"01;31;26;08","01;31;27;19","This is starting to show a bridge."
"01;31;27;19","01;31;31;06","There why coaching at different levels"
"01;31;31;23","01;31;34;12","and and positive psychology more broadly"
"01;31;34;27","01;31;36;27","can have a role."
"01;31;40;25","01;31;41;15","OK, great."
"01;31;41;15","01;31;43;07","Thank you. Stephen Dean."
"01;31;43;07","01;31;43;29","Yeah,"
"01;31;44;25","01;31;47;09","Stephen,I appreciate exactly what you're saying."
"01;31;47;09","01;31;48;08","I just"
"01;31;49;05","01;31;51;20","I think to get to a place"
"01;31;51;20","01;31;55;12","where interaction isis no longer threatening."
"01;31;56;18","01;32;00;02","People have to want or appreciate"
"01;32;00;02","01;32;03;10","that you can be a subject matter expertand a prediction matter expert."
"01;32;03;25","01;32;06;16","And I'm not sure I think there aremaybe are"
"01;32;06;16","01;32;09;05","some coaches who are both"
"01;32;10;05","01;32;12;11","and I but I sort of transcended"
"01;32;12;11","01;32;17;13","that and got into the wayfaring thingbecause Wayfaring imposes"
"01;32;17;27","01;32;20;04","a prediction aspect to this."
"01;32;20;17","01;32;25;20","I can't predict for you whether thatrunning jump shot that you make."
"01;32;25;29","01;32;30;09","I can't be in your earI cannot coach you to take that shot"
"01;32;30;09","01;32;33;21","in that momentwith that much time left on the clock."
"01;32;33;24","01;32;39;18","In fact, if I do that, I'm probablyadding impediments and I'm actually being"
"01;32;39;18","01;32;45;15","an optimal control is micromanagingyou and you, whether you make it or not."
"01;32;45;20","01;32;47;07","It's not about me."
"01;32;47;07","01;32;50;04","It's about whetherthe ball and the and the"
"01;32;51;06","01;32;51;15","and the"
"01;32;51;15","01;32;54;21","basket arrived at some sort of outcomethat we both want."
"01;32;55;12","01;32;58;11","I think that I think that that's part of"
"01;32;59;16","01;33;02;03","how we get people to a place where"
"01;33;02;29","01;33;06;26","their dependency on their subject,subject matter, expertize"
"01;33;07;12","01;33;09;25","doesn't overwhelm the fact that"
"01;33;09;25","01;33;13;14","for these performancesthere is a predictive element."
"01;33;14;00","01;33;17;06","And so we have to sort ofgive that equal billing."
"01;33;18;04","01;33;20;12","I don't think we have to overbill oneor the other."
"01;33;20;19","01;33;22;16","It's back to the between."
"01;33;22;16","01;33;24;09","And that's a prediction matter expert."
"01;33;24;09","01;33;28;27","And again, I don't knowif it's a role being a way fairer"
"01;33;29;25","01;33;32;10","because you're in the boatwith that other person, right?"
"01;33;32;25","01;33;36;06","It doesn't matter whether you're the onesaying, OK, well, I'm"
"01;33;36;18","01;33;39;06","I'm getting a sense of the directionof the current"
"01;33;39;06","01;33;42;16","right now and the other person'slooking up at the stars."
"01;33;42;17","01;33;44;22","You're working together."
"01;33;44;22","01;33;47;07","And so, yeah,everybody brings their expertize."
"01;33;48;01","01;33;50;15","And I think that that only"
"01;33;51;21","01;33;53;22","that only materializes"
"01;33;53;22","01;33;57;07","if we can if we can include somethingwith the subject matter."
"01;33;57;07","01;34;00;20","Expertize culturally, yes, absolutely."
"01;34;00;20","01;34;02;24","There's a huge cultural piece to it."
"01;34;03;20","01;34;07;21","But I think I think you can be a coachand not necessarily"
"01;34;07;21","01;34;10;22","be a Wayfarer,but I think if you're a wayfarer,"
"01;34;11;14","01;34;14;18","you have to bring a predictive elementinto it."
"01;34;14;24","01;34;17;27","Otherwise you're not being aware."
"01;34;18;11","01;34;20;23","It's interesting"
"01;34;21;05","01;34;24;00","that having an integrated wayto talk about"
"01;34;24;14","01;34;27;05","goal and process"
"01;34;27;28","01;34;30;15","and interactionwith a niche interaction with your"
"01;34;30;27","01;34;33;19","CO wayfarers,"
"01;34;33;19","01;34;36;03","just like your example with a movie,you know, there's"
"01;34;36;22","01;34;40;06","is the map app going to tell youwhich directions to take"
"01;34;40;20","01;34;44;16","that's kind of on the instructionlist, end verses, are you on the run?"
"01;34;44;26","01;34;49;19","So anywhere you go, you're,you're just not following instructions."
"01;34;49;19","01;34;52;20","You're just negotiatingsequential interactions"
"01;34;53;00","01;34;55;23","and reducing uncertainty in a waythat isn't just"
"01;34;55;27","01;34;59;13","looking down at the applicationand seeing which way to turn when."
"01;35;01;19","01;35;03;25","And I'm glad you picked up on the"
"01;35;04;09","01;35;07;12","the map going out the backand over the trunk of the car."
"01;35;08;09","01;35;09;05","Yeah, exactly."
"01;35;09;05","01;35;12;00","Oh, you're reading it. Oh, no."
"01;35;12;00","01;35;12;16","Right."
"01;35;13;11","01;35;13;24","Cool."
"01;35;13;24","01;35;16;08","Well, Stephen. Yes."
"01;35;16;08","01;35;17;15","It's just one question."
"01;35;17;15","01;35;20;02","Wayfair, is that like a particular"
"01;35;20;24","01;35;24;14","sort of approach is like an orientationbased or."
"01;35;25;21","01;35;26;25","Yeah, you're on your path."
"01;35;26;25","01;35;29;07","And how are you fairing?How are you feeling?"
"01;35;29;07","01;35;31;22","OK, right. It's not just wayfinding."
"01;35;32;05","01;35;34;29","It's not just the discovery piece,but it's"
"01;35;35;21","01;35;38;20","so how does that make you feelbeing in that uncertainty space?"
"01;35;39;03","01;35;42;05","Because again,if we're going to close loop discovery,"
"01;35;42;05","01;35;45;22","we'll eventually loop backaround a recapitulation and then."
"01;35;45;24","01;35;48;25","Right, we're open systemsthat are constantly closing these loops."
"01;35;49;04","01;35;51;16","So how does that make you feel like?"
"01;35;51;16","01;35;52;04","Oh, yeah."
"01;35;52;20","01;35;55;27","To connect that also to John Boik"
"01;35;56;01","01;36;00;21","and Second Order Science,as well as Bucky Fuller and Trim Tab."
"01;36;01;22","01;36;03;21","When we're"
"01;36;03;21","01;36;08;16","the rudder, weneed to act in an anticipatory fashion."
"01;36;08;16","01;36;10;21","So that's kind of like first ordercybernetics."
"01;36;10;21","01;36;14;22","The the rudder has to turnbefore you hit the iceberg."
"01;36;15;00","01;36;16;11","You know, you got to find a path."
"01;36;16;11","01;36;20;15","So pathfinding and that whole notionof anticipating or control"
"01;36;21;06","01;36;25;25","comes to the rudder and the trim tabis the little rudder on the rudder."
"01;36;26;03","01;36;31;22","So it's anticipatingeven the anticipatory nature of planning"
"01;36;32;03","01;36;36;03","because you have to turn that trim tabeven before you turn the rudder."
"01;36;36;19","01;36;40;26","And so here we haveinstead of a sort of mechanical model"
"01;36;40;26","01;36;45;10","with recursive levels of rudders,we actually have hierarchically"
"01;36;45;10","01;36;47;14","nested priors."
"01;36;47;14","01;36;50;22","And so it's a little bitlike higher and higher level priors"
"01;36;51;10","01;36;56;05","that in one sense when you lookat one iceberg and you try to"
"01;36;57;05","01;37;00;03","tell a story by backfilling, what happens"
"01;37;00;15","01;37;03;18","they do actin increasingly anticipatory ways,"
"01;37;04;01","01;37;07;20","but then when it's seen as just partof the wayfinding of the ship,"
"01;37;08;08","01;37;11;00","they're all in a cyclic feedbackwith each other."
"01;37;11;00","01;37;13;13","And it's not likeone is really upstream of another,"
"01;37;13;21","01;37;16;04","but there are certainly piecesdoing different things"
"01;37;18;24","01;37;20;29","cool stuff."
"01;37;22;10","01;37;26;00","Any final thoughts or questions?"
"01;37;26;00","01;37;31;03","I don't see any other questionsfrom the live chat, but another"
"01;37;31;22","01;37;34;05","interesting and surprising dot"
"01;37;34;06","01;37;37;20","two as usual,"
"01;37;37;20","01;37;42;13","does anyone have any final comments. And."
"01;37;45;29","01;37;47;23","Well great."
"01;37;47;23","01;37;50;17","We'll look forward to"
"01;37;50;17","01;37;52;21","some awesome up coming streams."
"01;37;52;21","01;37;55;24","Let's just look at those really fast."
"01;37;55;24","01;37;57;05","Next week"
"01;37;58;11","01;38;00;02","on the 21st, we're going to have"
"01;38;00;02","01;38;02;25","our symposium with Carl Feresten."
"01;38;03;11","01;38;06;26","So if you've been helping to co-organizedthis event"
"01;38;06;26","01;38;10;04","and develop the questions with us,you'll be with us live."
"01;38;10;04","01;38;14;11","Otherwise we're going to berecording this, not live streaming it"
"01;38;14;24","01;38;18;17","and then providing the recordingson our YouTube channel."
"01;38;19;04","01;38;21;07","And then for the second two weeks"
"01;38;21;19","01;38;24;14","of June, we're going to be"
"01;38;26;18","01;38;29;13","doinga more technical or statistical paper"
"01;38;29;25","01;38;33;20","empirical evaluation of active inferencein multi armed bandits."
"01;38;34;10","01;38;39;15","Then in early July,we're going to have a fields and living"
"01;38;39;15","01;38;44;07","paper scale free biology, integratingevolutionary and developmental thinking."
"01;38;45;05","01;38;48;05","Then don't have any papersfor the end of July"
"01;38;48;05","01;38;50;17","or beginning of August,but we'll figure out"
"01;38;51;06","01;38;53;28","what we want to do there,and then we'll be"
"01;38;54;15","01;38;57;09","turning to some industrial engineeringand some other areas."
"01;38;57;09","01;39;00;21","So as always, pretty fun journey."
"01;39;01;14","01;39;04;20","Thanks Dean Blue, Stephen,"
"01;39;04;21","01;39;09;05","Dave for participating liveand everyone for watching live on replay."
