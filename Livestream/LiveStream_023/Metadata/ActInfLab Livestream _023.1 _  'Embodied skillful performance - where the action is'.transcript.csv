"Speaker 1","00;00;08;18","00;00;46;27","Greetings. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining live or in replay today. It is May 27th is that true? Not. Not even close. Not even close. It's June. If it's June 8th. 20, 21. We're here in Acton. Love Live Stream 23.1. And we are discussing the paper embodied skillful performance where the action is. So welcome, everyone to Active Love. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;00;47;13","00;01;25;14","You can find us at the links that are here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream with all of the advantages and constraints that that provides. Please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be trying to follow good etiquette for live streams from this short link, you can access the calendar of events for live streams of multiple different kinds and highlighted there with the blue arrows are today's discussion on June 8th and next week's discussion."
"Speaker 1","00;01;25;14","00;01;45;19","That'll be on the 15th and they're both going to be on this paper embodied skillful performance so we had a good time making the Dart zero and learning about this and kind of opening up what this was adjacent to. And now we'll look forward to continuing the discussion and just seeing where it goes for those who are watching live."
"Speaker 1","00;01;45;19","00;02;22;12","It would be, I guess, especially appreciated to throw us some questions whether they're related to the paper or not. The goal for today is to discuss and learn. The paper is embodied skillful performance where the action is by Hipp, Alito, Walter Feresten and Ramstad from 2021 and today in 23.1 will be ambling skillfully we hope through the paper again and flagging areas where we want to be talking with the authors next week."
"Speaker 1","00;02;22;26","00;02;52;20","Greetings Dave welcome. And just seeing where we get to opening up threads and kind of enjoying the middle part of the .01 to sandwich so we can begin with the introductions and the warm ups today. There's a few of us so we can go round in the introduction and just give a short introduction or a check in and we can also then pass somebody who hasn't spoken taking a look at the warm up questions."
"Speaker 1","00;02;52;20","00;03;01;11","So I'm Daniel, I'm a post-doctoral researcher in California and I'll pass to Dean Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;03;01;11","00;03;20;16","Hi, I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary and I'm getting more and more involved with this idea of sort of building up the active inference profile of the day that Dave is there. But if he isn't, then I'll pass it back to Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;03;22;05","00;03;32;14","Dave, you're welcome to join in whenever you would like. I hear you tapping a little bit, but maybe whenever you want to speak otherwise, what is the active inference profile?"
"Speaker 2","00;03;34;10","00;03;56;08","That's what I think we're trying to build out here. I think we're trying to give that some anchors and some leverage, so we haven't figured it out completely yet. It's like everything in active inference. It's it's a generative model. It's growing and I don't know what its final form will be or if it takes on a final form, even."
"Speaker 1","00;03;58;04","00;04;03;00","Are there other areas that have profiles or are there other profiles of note."
"Speaker 2","00;04;05;04","00;04;30;10","Yeah. I think there's convention that that's already an established profile, and I don't know that this has got to that place yet. Where it where we can say it has a convention or something that's predictable about it. And I think that's what makes it makes it kind of well, in my mind, it makes it curious where's it going as opposed to where it's been in what it's established so far."
"Speaker 1","00;04;32;15","00;04;58;11","Nice points, agreed. Active inference, especially in these nascent times. It's like a strange attractor where people come in from so many perspectives and then they get slingshot out in a different direction or with a different memory or a different view. So Dave, no worries about the hardware mystery. Everyone is welcome to just type in the YouTube chat if they have questions."
"Speaker 1","00;04;58;26","00;05;24;05","So I think for the rest of this stream we're going to walk through again, maybe thinking again about walking as a skill for action and all the fun, similarities and differences between motor actions, which are what are discussed here and that sort of space where motor and knowledge come together like with skilled action. Yes, Dave your your different embodiments are muted indeed."
"Speaker 1","00;05;26;05","00;06;00;26","So in the paper I laid out their aims and claims, and the central aim of the paper, according to the authors, is to discuss critically the limitations of constructionist control, theoretic models of skillful performance. So the big dichotomy or dilemma that's going to come up again and again is this difference between interaction ism and constructionism. So maybe, Dean, where are you coming at that from or how would you describe the difference between constructionism and interaction as well?"
"Speaker 2","00;06;02;21","00;06;38;26","Well, first of all, even including interaction ism as a formality, I think it's a huge step. It's it's metaphorically speaking, it's it's opening both of your eyes. You have a second eye available that maybe you weren't aware of it. And now with with the idea of turning that into sort of a a structured or formalized approach, as opposed to just the instructional ism piece, which is traditionally what we've formalize it is it's not just a doubling of of what we might be aware of."
"Speaker 2","00;06;39;09","00;07;05;29","It's it's actually placing ourselves where we can see the depth of what we're observing or what we're analyzing or what we're addressing. And I think that that's that would be a huge step if we could get people comfortable with that. I'm not saying that people will necessarily get comfortable with it, though, because for a lot of people, let's be honest, just following along and being instructed is difficult enough."
"Speaker 2","00;07;06;12","00;07;29;10","And now you're introducing a whole second lens of information and very quickly you'll have a bunch of people screaming, no, you're going to overwhelm them. You're going, well, I'm not. Just because I have both my eyes open doesn't mean that I'm going to be open, doesn't mean I'm going to be scared. I hope it means that I'm going to feel a little like a little bit more grounded and centered."
"Speaker 2","00;07;29;10","00;07;34;10","But we'll we'll we'll have a conversation about that today, especially when we include the whole body."
"Speaker 1","00;07;35;16","00;08;02;12","Yes, the entire corpus. One thought there constructionism being like instructions are passed from A to B, you know, water flowing downhill. Constructionism has a directional context. And also the idea that what's being passed is the sort of packet of meaning, like here's the envelope with your instructions. Now carry them out. And what I think is exciting about interaction ism is it's not just a bi directional constructionism."
"Speaker 1","00;08;02;23","00;08;44;02","It's not like, well, you instruct me and then I'll instruct you. That's sort of the the low bar for interaction ism, but where interaction ism really blows the lid off is when we open into that third space of interaction and improvization. So I think that's what's kind of interesting to draw out. And they are going to highlight in this paper how control theory models of skillful performance or otherwise implicitly or explicitly do have constructionist assumptions, specifically this idea that motor representations convey or harness instructions about how to perform a specific task."
"Speaker 1","00;08;44;16","00;09;13;21","So even if the authors of those control theory papers didn't explicitly use the word constructionism, then they're still playing into this idea that instructions are being passed, for example, from the brain to the body in order to be carried out and we'll be looking at that from a more formal perspective in a few minutes. And the big claim that they're going to be reaching is that active inference doesn't need to posit that constructionist assumption."
"Speaker 1","00;09;13;28","00;09;46;20","So there's a way to frame control and skillful performance in the active inference framework that doesn't take on these constructionist assumptions and the content based directional message passing that it entails. And that'll be something fun to explore. Also, Dave has a nice comment in Chat. Dave wrote, As I recall, Piaget and colleagues counted in described something like 400 distinct, embodied concepts used by the walking skills of a typical 15 month old."
"Speaker 1","00;09;48;03","00;09;58;05","So that just shows how there's a lot going on, even with behaviors like walking calls."
"Speaker 2","00;09;58;24","00;10;47;11","When others think to the assumption that somehow the muscles and the nerve endings sending signals that are in symbolic form is quite a stretch. And I mean where we talked about that last week when we got to that inverse directionality slide. But I thought about that a little bit after because I went back and watched that last week and I was just like, I know for me, I was incredulous a couple a couple of times we went through the paper with, with Blue, but even going back and looking at it, you'd have to you'd have to build a really powerful argument that says that the pressure signals on my fingertips are coming back to me"
"Speaker 2","00;10;47;11","00;10;53;09","in verbalized form exactly."
"Speaker 1","00;10;53;09","00;11;18;03","It's this idea that, you know, the files are on the computer. Like what's coming up from the fingertips is pain and what's going down is an instruction that's sort of the Cartesian dualism mapped on to instruction ism is just like body and brain are two disjoint pieces and they pass special symbolic information to each other."
"Speaker 2","00;11;18;22","00;11;19;03","Right."
"Speaker 1","00;11;19;14","00;11;20;22","And we'll see how."
"Speaker 2","00;11;21;06","00;11;23;16","Our brain and our bodies are having a conversation."
"Speaker 1","00;11;24;18","00;11;28;17","So what is it if not a conversation? Or could it be beyond a conversation?"
"Speaker 2","00;11;28;23","00;11;29;11","Right, right."
"Speaker 1","00;11;30;02","00;11;31;28","Nice. Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;11;34;23","00;12;14;19","We covered the abstract last time. I will point out here is just that they start as good philosophers with an examination of the constructionism and what that entails. The second and third sections of the paper are characterizing the representation ism representational ism that's related to these motor commands, kind of what we were just alluding to, and a special focus on the optimal motor control theory and then the final sections take it to predictive coding and to active inference, which are formal frameworks for modeling behavior that are related to control theory formalization."
"Speaker 1","00;12;14;20","00;12;41;12","But the goal of the paper is to show that some of the constructionism is left at home, which allows us to go out with interaction ism here is the roadmap, framing a similar outline and also just giving a few more signposts along the way and the figures and the box and whatnot."
"Speaker 1","00;12;44;02","00;13;45;01","The keywords provided here were helping us understand what did the authors want to have their work. Indexable near in the semantic net literature online. How did the authors want their work to be grounded? And it was in skillful performance. That's in the title Optimal Motor Control. That's the sort of scapegoat or foil. That's the contrast maybe even bring us back to contrasting divergences instruction ism again, tied up with the optimal motor control motor representations, lending leading us into action oriented representations, and finally taking us to active inference where we kind of begin and end so skillful performance can mean many pieces, and the authors defined it as opposed to bear movements such as breathing and"
"Speaker 1","00;13;45;01","00;14;22;01","blinking, skillful performances are intelligent bodily activities which harness knowledge about how to perform certain movements expertly. It reminds me of the eternal debate who slash what is intelligent if an insect knows how to walk, or if it is trained to do something versus if it's something that its body provides the training for, inherently what is skillful. So definitely we'll want to ask the authors and anybody in the chair and anybody who joins us next week what is skillful performance?"
"Speaker 1","00;14;22;14","00;14;31;29","What is unskillful performance? If somebody tries to do a skillful performance and fails, is that still within this category of behavior?"
"Speaker 2","00;14;33;05","00;14;57;09","I saved I saved up for this week because I wanted to get to the after the comma, the witch harness which harnessed knowledge I like I kind of hinted that that's the I wanted to ask a question. I still do want to ask a question. What does that mean to harness knowledge consciously or or is it can you get to a place?"
"Speaker 2","00;14;57;16","00;15;24;20","I mean, Blue talked about this. You talked about this. Can we get to a place of doing it automatically? Does that mean it's harness just because we're not thinking about it? And how much time did they spend looking at that piece? Because that that kind of demarcates what skill is is it if it's a dependent, if it's a dependency on harnessing then what?"
"Speaker 2","00;15;25;02","00;15;29;07","How do we define that? How do we define what's what's captured and what isn't?"
"Speaker 1","00;15;30;29","00;15;58;08","And the harnessing brings up kind of like harnessing or yoking, you know, a buffalo or a horse or something like that. And that's kind of hinging on that word. It's like the knowledge is that wild stallion, and it's actually the bodily activities which harness that knowledge because when you know that your body can move in many different ways."
"Speaker 1","00;15;58;25","00;16;11;20","But skillful performance is when that is harnessed, it's when it's connected to an instrument or whether it's its own instrument and it's channels in a way maybe that's productive or expressive."
"Speaker 2","00;16;13;05","00;16;48;27","Well, at a fundamental level, we have to again be careful that so that something going on at our fingertips is being harnessed by something going on three and a half feet away. Yes. Connected. But but is that an assumption that's verifiable is there an actual harnessing going on even because lots and lots of times things happen at my fingertips that I'm not sending I'm not even aware of what my hand is doing."
"Speaker 2","00;16;49;06","00;16;55;11","My wife tells me, stop jiggling, right? If just because I get nervous energy or whatever."
"Speaker 1","00;16;56;14","00;17;19;02","I think that's going to come back also to the predictive processing and predictive coding frameworks, which is sort of when the body is getting the seat, the signals it expects. Like if you're not consciously bringing your attention to your foot, if it's just your foot in the shoe it feels like nothing or there's no attention paid to it."
"Speaker 1","00;17;19;14","00;17;38;08","And you can kind of shine that light of attention on it and it will feel normal. Or maybe you can start to zoom in on other sensations like tingling or other feelings, but the sort of default state when you're not paying attention, things that are happening the way that you expect is neutral. And so that's where."
"Speaker 2","00;17;38;14","00;17;48;02","That's why that active inference piece is really interesting because in order for it to be active inferencing, there has to be some kind of attention or awareness being paid."
"Speaker 1","00;17;52;03","00;18;26;09","And that's like if attention as a resource got to pay the cost of attention or suffer suffer the regret of not paying attention. And Dave, Dave wrote, Trying and failing, especially if part of the problem is choking, which was brought up by the authors in the paper as well, is likelier to involve more neocortical activation and more excess consciousness than smooth performance of the same routine so trying and failing, there's a lot more inner dialog or thought process like awareness happening."
"Speaker 1","00;18;26;09","00;18;48;04","Whereas when something is performed skillfully and smoothly, it just sort of goes off without a hitch and just, you know, you whip out the instrument, make your your shot or your swing or whatever it happens to be. And then maybe you can narrate in retrospect, but in the moment you're not having as much awareness. So that's something like."
"Speaker 2","00;18;48;17","00;19;28;06","One last is. Oh, yes. So this is really interesting to me because again, is it skillful to be in the peloton and B, be pulled along by what we would describe as the intention of those in front of you? Is that considered to be a part of this? Because there's a lot of things that we're aware and conscious of and some things that happen in these skill performances they're just because they're part of the collective, they're they're caught up in the inertia of the moment and is how do we how do we factor that in when we're talking about active inference?"
"Speaker 2","00;19;28;06","00;19;56;08","Because I think that's what instructional ism doesn't tend to there's many, many things that are going to get dragged along here just because they're drafting and I don't how do we how do we address that when we're talking about skill performance, skillful performance and interaction isn't because interaction ism at least says I can be caught up in an in an inertia moment."
"Speaker 2","00;19;57;01","00;19;58;09","I don't have to explain it."
"Speaker 1","00;19;59;27","00;20;24;18","Absolutely. Instruct organism has to pigeonhole everything into that symbolic information theory. What is the instruction from the front of the pack of the flock of birds or the peloton of cyclists? What is the instruction that's getting passed back? And so we have to go from what we know is just happening, which is like the physical inertia there's also a narrative inertia."
"Speaker 1","00;20;24;24","00;20;51;02","There might even be just an air current going over the person that actually stabilizes them in their spot. We don't need to fall back to referring to those as instructions when they're clearly interacting phenomena different types of interactions. You can have somebody breathing heavily next to you and that could give you a signal, but it's about the unpacking of that interaction."
"Speaker 1","00;20;51;17","00;20;59;09","And then where that takes the collective rather than, again, just thinking about everything as connected with wires and passing secrets."
"Speaker 2","00;21;00;03","00;21;00;13","Right."
"Speaker 1","00;21;01;02","00;21;01;11","Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;21;04;07","00;21;44;13","We can look again at the active invert plants. So this was just asking where are the limits of skillful performance? If the niche and the fitness to the niche is what counts for different organisms? Our human cultural niche has all these awesome kinds of skillful performance and otherwise. But what about other creatures? What about other phenomena, the kinds of things that we might want to also model with active inference but just don't quite have that same level of maybe thinking through other minds as we have with people whereas we try to put ourselves in the shoes of somebody else."
"Speaker 2","00;21;46;03","00;21;56;03","Do you think, Daniel, that that plant has got an embodied technical skill welcome?"
"Speaker 1","00;21;56;03","00;21;56;12","Blue."
"Speaker 2","00;21;56;26","00;21;57;11","Hey, Blue."
"Speaker 1","00;21;58;02","00;22;02;05","I was just wondering whether plants have the the."
"Speaker 2","00;22;02;26","00;22;03;20","Sweat of."
"Speaker 1","00;22;03;21","00;22;04;05","This plant."
"Speaker 2","00;22;04;28","00;22;12;00","Technical skill now that it has the, the tools to be able to move from side to side."
"Speaker 1","00;22;15;26","00;22;18;02","It's a great question."
"Speaker 1","00;22;22;07","00;22;51;02","I wonder if if it could be shown that it got better at moving from side to side, that would start to look increasingly skill like. And I think it's that idea that it could the molecular changes could occur that would allow the plant to respond faster. Or you can imagine selecting on a whole greenhouse of plants and the ones that are able to switch faster those are going to grow faster."
"Speaker 1","00;22;51;10","00;23;20;11","And then you select the ones that grow faster based upon their ability to learn in that generation. So it kind of shows how you get this development of skill within a life that's developments. But then between generations, you can also have the entrenching or the catalyzing of learned skill like language and skillful performance in in this paper and in our slides."
"Speaker 1","00;23;20;11","00;23;53;11","It's kind of like we're hinting a lot at this full body type performance, high jump and things like that. But of course, language is maybe one of the examples of skilled performance. It's a motor behavior. It involves a huge number of interacting motor subunits, voice box, the mouth and speech therapists and others. They go deep into that. But speech is almost like the case where you say, Well, surely instructions are being passed."
"Speaker 1","00;23;54;01","00;24;30;26","That's maybe the the high watermark for where interaction is and could go would be to have a speech, a framing of speech that moved us beyond constructionism because this seems like clearly the transmutation of semantic or symbolic information into not directly related motor behavior. So that would be kind of a nice case to investigate. And Dave wrote in the chat, it seems odd that dogmas that have been known to be false for decades are still premises of so much funded professional activity."
"Speaker 1","00;24;31;08","00;25;02;05","I'm thinking of B.F. Skinner's insistence that all control activity must be strictly cortical, even though it's been known since at least the fifties, purely on the basis of speed of nerve conduction, that that would prevent graceful walking, let alone faster and more intricate movements. So that's pretty interesting. We have almost just anatomical reasons to know that not everything can go through this sort of control and cognition in the loop."
"Speaker 1","00;25;02;21","00;25;47;04","There's just not fast enough transduction along the nerves so there has to be this sort of distributed function more consistent with an interaction ist framework than an instruction framework. Yet it's easy to fall back to constructionism, maybe especially for professionalized areas let's go to optimal control if you want it. You know, feel free to add anything that you like optimal control theory is a nice bridge point because in the paper and as we'll be going into we're again thinking about motor behavior."
"Speaker 1","00;25;47;12","00;26;22;22","But control theory is something that applies to the electrical grid, to logistics, to robotics, which are I guess, motorized. But optimal control theory is a framework that expands to many non motor systems as well. So that makes me wonder about whether we can also apply that constructionism versus interaction ism. Contrast to control theoretic situations that are implicitly insurrectionist."
"Speaker 1","00;26;22;24","00;26;55;10","Like there's an algorithm and then it sends the buy order to the unit that makes the purchase on a market, or it sends a certain piece of information to a different computer that then enacts that like a suggestion. And then even in systems where we know instructions are being sent like computer systems, maybe there's an interaction, a way to think about that, to any other thoughts or."
"Speaker 2","00;26;56;21","00;27;09;27","Does optimal control essentially place all of our chips on the top down aspect of of the relationship between top down and bottom up?"
"Speaker 2","00;27;12;24","00;27;25;20","Does it does it do it? Does it optimal control say optimization happens exclusively from a top down direction. Ality that there is really no place for the bottom up part."
"Speaker 1","00;27;29;23","00;28;03;15","I think it's a good question and I'll skip to this first in 2011 paper which is entitled what is optimal about motor control. Right. I wonder if that optimality does arise from the top or what is optimal. Once we move beyond instruction ism, there's a perfect set of instructions. There's a perfect way to do it. And then that is either carried out faithfully or it's not."
"Speaker 2","00;28;05;00","00;28;43;26","Not so philosophically. If you said optimal would be some system of openness to both an ability to recapitulate and an ability to discover to be able to put those two things into some sort of coherent relationship not saying that that's what is being said here, but I'm just not sure. I'm not sure why we always assume that optimal is always above being able to create copy, even in scope, skillful at skillful performance even compared to a standard."
"Speaker 2","00;28;43;26","00;29;23;04","There are things that happen when a gymnast does their routine where some some element of the variability that applied to that situation is considered when something is being judged I think the only thing that that doesn't doesn't factor in variability is the clock, right? Like you either ran 9.8 seconds or you didn't. But many of the skillful, skillful, skillful performances that we pay attention to are always about a recapitulation."
"Speaker 2","00;29;24;07","00;29;32;23","So interesting. I don't know. I guess, again, it's how you all how you define it, but we want to we'll actually want to get on to doing something useful here. So."
"Speaker 1","00;29;33;12","00;29;58;21","Yeah. Yep. And also here's a line in that first in 2011 that reminds me of Dave's comment, which is these estimates which are coming from a predictive processing or active inference framework can finesse problems incurred by sensory delays and the exchange of signals between the central and peripheral nervous system. So the generative model can include space for that delay."
"Speaker 1","00;29;59;15","00;30;42;23","When we think about just sort of two people who are talking and accounting for each other's delay, for example, in that kind of an interaction versus the send process, we send back model, there's actions that happen faster. Another example that maybe would be like baseball where there's such a small amount of time to decide whether to initiate the behavior of swinging and this paper from ten years ago laid out just such an interesting difference between value learning and active inference, which allows for that pragmatic and epistemic component."
"Speaker 1","00;30;43;25","00;31;11;21","The optimal suggests multiple things. First off, it's like it kind of suggests that there is an optimum that is being achieved. So that's one maybe easier way to one easier point just to say, OK, well, maybe there's an optimal way, maybe there's not an optimal way, but what is being optimized is the value just like reinforcing it, learning what's being implicitly optimized here is a value function."
"Speaker 1","00;31;12;16","00;31;41;01","And just as it says here, the replacement of value and cost functions with prior beliefs about movements removes the optimal control problem completely. So this idea of the value in cost, it's kind of like an economic analysis of motor behavior. So then let's just imagine that any number of circumstances, like somebody has a belief about how performance will be viewed socially."
"Speaker 1","00;31;41;14","00;32;05;29","Well, you could couch that in reward and you could try to go break down from the narrative and the social all the way down to the movement of the fingers on the piano about the value. And well, if you mess up, it's a lower value action but you're getting really far away from the embodiment of the performance, which maybe doesn't have that same sort of cost all the way down."
"Speaker 1","00;32;06;06","00;32;27;29","So it's like, will we have cost functions and economics all the way down and value and cost, or will we have generative models and an instrumental way of thinking about action blue any thing overall otherwise? Also, anyone who's watching lives. Welcome to ask a related or an unrelated question."
"Speaker 3","00;32;30;16","00;32;30;26","Did."
"Speaker 1","00;32;32;02","00;32;36;17","Anything after last week's discussion that you'd been thinking about."
"Speaker 3","00;32;41;16","00;32;46;11","I'm trying to remember last week's discussion. Thank me. Refresh my memory."
"Speaker 1","00;32;47;19","00;33;12;17","Yep. That's what this first part is. Let's go to figure one and two of the paper and take a more formal look at and we can go to first in 2011 if we want more details on the similarities and differences because this is kind of the core of the contrast between optimal optimal motor control theory and active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;33;12;17","00;33;55;05","It's going to come down to the differences in how these models are framed because there's an interpretive layer. But at the heart of it, it's the differences between these two kinds of models between figure one and figure two here. So in FIG. one, we'll go to the juxtaposition in FIG. one and figure two, we have in both cases the plant kinetics, which are defined with the exact same equations and the sensory mapping so this red box is the same between both of the models, between control, optimal motor control on the left and active on the right."
"Speaker 1","00;33;56;06","00;34;28;28","And there is still an optimal control module in active inference. So that is interesting. But if we look a little closer, we can see that in FIG. one that motor commands that you with a tilde over it. It's the minimization. So it's optimization minimization maximization. Sometimes by minimizing the cost, you maximize the profit or it's flip able, throw a negative sign in there and a mean becomes a box."
"Speaker 1","00;34;29;17","00;35;09;10","So here what's being minimized is an integral of the potentially the cost function C of X and you for changes in time. So cost is being minimized through time and that is optimal control in that framework. When we look at the optimal control in the active inference model, we see a really different structure even of that optimal control module we see that you which is playing a similar role, it's not a command, but it's still being passed."
"Speaker 1","00;35;09;10","00;35;44;18","This you have t function is still related to a minimization, but what's happening inside of the equation is very different and we can go to the first in figure caption to see what is happening there. That e curly e is the distinction between extra supportive, which is e with literally and proprioceptive e with AP reporting on hidden states in intrinsic, extrinsic and intrinsic frames of references respectively."
"Speaker 1","00;35;45;10","00;36;14;02","These prediction errors are the difference between sensory input observed and predicted so going back to here, what's being minimized isn't the cost function through time, even philosophical disagreements with homo economicus aside, OK, let's put aside cost. And then there's the challenge of assigning cost to different kinds states. What's being minimized here is the cost through time. I mean, don't businesses try to do that?"
"Speaker 1","00;36;14;02","00;36;45;22","Everyone wants to figure out how to minimize costs or time. It's challenging to do what's being done here. The minimization between the proprioceptive sensory differential with the multiplication potentially through it, I'm not sure what that does in a model, but it just so interesting that the minimization here is just like we've talked about in so many of these discussions, it's about your generative model of action and sensory outcomes."
"Speaker 1","00;36;46;05","00;37;08;18","Sensory outcomes are emitted by hidden underlying states that you can't directly observe. Like you don't know exactly whether it's night or day, but you are getting photons or not. So there's a hidden state that's being evaluated. That's the sort of hidden Markov model component. And the hidden state is in the model emitting states that are being observed as sensory outcomes."
"Speaker 1","00;37;09;05","00;37;38;04","And in active inference, the depth of that generative model is actually such that instead of having a really rich generative model of cost functions and then trying to reverse engineer your cost function to find the cheapest behavior, the generative model is of expected sensory outcomes. Like every time I move my shoulder here, it starts to hurt. And we don't need to introduce a concept of reward or cost into that equation."
"Speaker 1","00;37;38;25","00;38;10;27","We can suffice to say that there is a generative model of the sensory outcomes under different motor policies and the organism has a preference for, let's just say being in non painful states. It sidesteps that question of cost in a way we can see that even from the side by side, even where there is an optimal control element, like a minimization element, what's being minimized is something that is very, very different."
"Speaker 1","00;38;11;19","00;38;38;11","And that's one of the key aspects of active inference that what's being minimized is the divergence between expected outcomes and realized outcomes. That's what of course makes it so related to predictive coding predictive processing, rather than drawing only on the reinforcement learning type approaches that are doing a minimization implicitly maximization on reward."
"Speaker 2","00;38;39;18","00;39;15;20","Then you can add color in a little bit, please. When I saw this, it was interesting because what I saw was not I guess it was a replacement. So on the figure one, it's do estimation. And then in figure two, what I saw was the removal of that and the application of rules. So minimize prediction errors. That's the rule as opposed to a step."
"Speaker 2","00;39;16;09","00;39;43;20","And all I thought about was, for example, Hippocratic Oath, if I don't know what I should be doing in terms of this patient. But the rule is do no harm. So I think that's what I thought was really interesting here is that the actual step was replaced with a rule and that and that to me was the big differentiator, the introduction of rules."
"Speaker 2","00;39;43;20","00;40;13;03","That's what I asked last week when you changed the rules of the game for the plant. I know the affordances changed and I know the tools were introduced and all of that stuff, but I keep coming back to tools rules and pools, tools being obvious, rules being obvious, tools just being an aggregation of resources. And so I think if you if you're able to sort of coordinate all three, it gives you a different sense of what might be going on."
"Speaker 1","00;40;14;19","00;40;35;17","OK, a fun thought on that. Just to think about game playing, the rules are always in effect and the rules can be explicit or implicit, like it's a rule in chess that you have to move out of check or figure out how to get out of check. But then there's sort of what are equivalent to rules. Like if a piece is pinned, it can't move, but you don't need to state that as a rule."
"Speaker 1","00;40;35;26","00;40;57;24","So rules are there simultaneous. They're always in effect unless there's another rule and they can breed emergence. You just say, OK, there's here's how the pieces move and then here's check. Those are the rules. And then it's as if there's a rule that is you can't move out of a append piece. So rules always in effect, allow for the space of emergence."
"Speaker 1","00;40;58;04","00;41;27;01","Steps have to be sequential. And so it's almost like we're moving from the within around of a game that's the constructionist. OK, you're playing risk first, roll the die. Now see whether the three is higher than the two die or whatever it happens to be. And interaction ism is pulling us back to like the rules in the pattern that still there can be sequential instructions or sequential information can occur."
"Speaker 1","00;41;27;19","00;41;36;24","But it is very different to have rules rather than specified steps. So it's like we're building yeah. Go ahead."
"Speaker 2","00;41;37;10","00;41;58;17","Just one last thing. So when I would ask young people to watch a video clip of something and I would ask them to draw three columns and title them tools, rules and rules and find examples, find tokens of each. What do you think was the easiest thing for them to accumulate under? It was tools. So those have got the edges."
"Speaker 2","00;41;58;23","00;42;39;09","What was that? What was the second highest aggregation pools? Because they could they could literally figure out what was congregating, what was the hardest thing, the parallel processing, which is what you just described, it's always going off the sequential. It's much easier to account for the parallel processing happening as cool currents is the hardest thing for people when when you're walking into a novel situation to take account of so that you can you can say it, it's just being aware of it and finding examples of it that's really, really hard for most minds."
"Speaker 3","00;42;40;07","00;42;52;21","So even from a computational aspects, right, like the parallel rising functions make them like speed up so much. Right? But they also are so computationally intensive, right?"
"Speaker 2","00;42;53;00","00;42;54;27","Yeah. Exactly."
"Speaker 1","00;42;55;24","00;43;20;12","Dave has another great comment on this slide. He wrote, I'm looking for where time is applied in the two approaches, the intrinsic frame of reference for active is you tilde of T. So that's we'll zoom in a little bit on just figure two. Here's that you tilde of t passing through the intrinsic frame of reference, but there's no explicit T in the optimal control formula."
"Speaker 1","00;43;20;12","00;43;50;11","We can just see that motor commands you tilde are passed so there's kind of like a timelessness to, you know, contract this muscle. It's not contract this muscle. Now it's actually just a timeless statement. So T he says, whereas T is inside the optimal control formula here is t d d it's a derivative through time and not in the intrinsic frame of reference as seen in active."
"Speaker 1","00;43;50;19","00;44;13;20","So he asks whether that tells us where the approaches are taking account of time differently. I think that's a great question is how does time play a role differently in these two frameworks? Let's keep on looking for similarities and differences so we have rules, not steps for active inference. We introduce a time dependance of that downward Ford Motor Signal."
"Speaker 1","00;44;15;04","00;44;46;08","We have, of course, a deep generative model component. We have state estimation is that's the the Hamlet joke. There's this whole module that's clearly difference in optimal motor control, which is the state estimation and that's what doesn't need to be done in active inference is this state estimation of OK, given the sensory input we're getting, like I'm getting two thirds of my propria receptors here and one third here are firing."
"Speaker 1","00;44;46;08","00;45;11;10","So let's estimate that the arm is here. OK, now pass that to the next part of the model. Given that the arm is here, what do we want to get the arm to? OK, now given which side of where we want the arm to go to we estimate the optimal and the actual are send the command, you know, turn the steering wheel to the side to bring it into alignment."
"Speaker 1","00;45;11;10","00;45;38;14","With the optimal or the most rewarding state. So state estimation is in optimum motor control theory, but in active inference you just don't have it. And that's sort of an interesting piece to drop out of the model because we don't need to have an explicit representation in or an explicit variable with the location of the arm. So that's a."
"Speaker 2","00;45;38;15","00;45;38;28","Rule."
"Speaker 1","00;45;41;01","00;46;07;19","It's like John Cage, everybody has the best seat. It's almost like it's enough to just say you're on the ocean, you're sailing, and then you're going to be trying to reduce your uncertainty as you pursue policies that in your generative model of the world, which includes latent causes so the deep generative model includes like latent causes of the world which are not anywhere to be seen in this option."
"Speaker 1","00;46;07;20","00;46;36;10","Motor control theory, like there's a deep latent cause that if too much weight is on this branch, it's going to break. But where is that? The constraints of the niche or something that's deep rotation out there. So anyways, it's like you're in the boat. You want to be reducing your uncertainty about getting the sensory states that you want, like seeing that land look bigger, reflecting you being closer, but you don't need to have that GPS coordinate."
"Speaker 1","00;46;36;10","00;47;00;10","Where am I OK now? Where do I want to be and how are we going to get there? It's enough to actually have a sensory preference and then reduce your uncertainty on the trajectory of reaching that sensory outcome. So that's a big difference in active inference and I'm seeing even a few more. Let's look at the green boxes."
"Speaker 1","00;47;00;23","00;47;29;19","So in the green box for figure one, we have a forward model. So they write that the function of the forward model is to improve the execution of action. It's kind of funny. Executive Executive Office or the executive component of the government it's about executing. That's where the instructions are issued from. Executive orders improve the execution of action by helping to finesse the inferences of the state estimate her."
"Speaker 1","00;47;30;05","00;47;58;13","So again, it's in feedback with the state estimate and that it's sending an effort copy. So that's outgoing is deference. And so there's this feedback between the prediction of basically where the body is in this case, and then that gets sent. It's kind of interesting that the X comes from the state estimation. That's the where is the arm."
"Speaker 1","00;47;59;03","00;48;33;01","And then the forward model is the Ford model of motor control. That is what connects with this. You tilde that's the green box, that forward model in Optum Motor Control, whereas in active inference we have a difference Ford model, it's a Ford model of X as well as V, which is the prior belief. So again, there doesn't need to be a Ford model of position and motor action as happening here."
"Speaker 1","00;48;33;29","00;48;51;26","It's enough potentially to have a model of action and over beliefs. We can look at the first in caption to see a little bit more closely. Yeah. Any thoughts on that?"
"Speaker 2","00;48;55;15","00;49;21;20","Nick, this state estimate or to go back, I think one live stream state estimates says that there has to be ties between the two rails to stabilize those eyes so that some processing can take place. I think what this talks about is the fact that we know that there's a gradient. We know the train is going to roll downhill as long as there's a gradient."
"Speaker 2","00;49;21;26","00;49;46;02","It's a rule as opposed to try to stabilize the relationship between the ties of the railroad. Two very different ways of looking at something and I think that this goes kind of back to what I said. I think there are times when we do give ourselves instructions and then there are times when we simply parallel process because we have a rule."
"Speaker 2","00;49;46;09","00;50;17;02","I don't want to make mistakes because that doesn't serve my my goals or my target. And I think I can I just suggest that the inclusion of both is probably to our advantage. It's just that what we tend to do is give all of our well, we've been trained to give all of our attention over to making sure that the thing is stabilized nice."
"Speaker 1","00;50;17;08","00;50;44;26","Also one piece of first in 2011 that's not brought over to this paper figure one was that motor control figure two is predictive coding and motor control. So already we see the reduction of the model in the terms of the state estimate goes away you don't need to explicitly have a state estimate or because the state estimate here has now been subsumed into the forward model which is why crucially the mapping from hidden states to sensations is now part of the forward generative model."
"Speaker 1","00;50;45;11","00;51;06;07","So we have a generative model of what we expect and now with predictive coding, instead of keeping a variable of what we think is happening, we just have which is can be tracked through time and all that. We're simplifying that state estimate her by including the expectations about the state estimate her in our forward model that's predictive coding."
"Speaker 1","00;51;06;24","00;51;37;14","How does that differentiate from active inference? So that's a good question. Here we have plant kinetics, sensory mappings, forward model and optimal control with a cost function still coming in, you still see that integral with the minimization of motor commands you over time, whereas in active inference, again we're moving from it's more valuable to be getting the signals I like and I like rewarding things to."
"Speaker 1","00;51;37;25","00;52;04;02","I'm just bringing the sensory outcomes into alignment with expectations and I'm selecting policies based upon which ones I think are going to get me there. And then this section that I had highlighted in summary, the tenet of optimal control lies in the reduction of optimal motion to flow on a value function like the downhill flow of water so that's pragmatic value."
"Speaker 1","00;52;04;11","00;52;30;28","And that's awesome because think about how much work has been done on information flows in the last ten years. Conversely, in active inference, the flow is specified directly in terms of the equations of motion that constitute prior beliefs like patterns of wind flow. The essential difference. So how do we go from water going downhill on the value, you know, gradient descent up and down again, the kind of get flipped around."
"Speaker 1","00;52;30;28","00;52;56;26","But how do we go from just thinking about what direction does gravity take you? That's value, that's reward. There's one answer. You know, which policy for financial outcomes is going to have a higher value? That's that scalar estimate of value. The essential difference is that prior beliefs in active inference can include solenoid or flow. So this is where we're opening up the whole discussion of play."
"Speaker 1","00;52;56;27","00;53;23;18","So I hope that we can think about that for a second and first and says, you know, he doesn't want to overstate the shortcomings of optimal control. So it's not that you can't introduce a solenoid or components to value. You can have the idea of solenoid or flow circulating on ISO contours. But how many businesses stop and say, you know, let's not pick the most rewarding number, let's look for maybe it's not the most rewarding number, but then there's the most solenoid."
"Speaker 1","00;53;23;18","00;53;47;21","I'll play around that number. People say, but we're not going to be doing those, so why would we stop at, you know, 5000 feet when we know that we can get to 6000 feet and so on. Oil flow and the ability to have that pragmatic and epistemic that directed and the solenoid all components opens up the space of play, hopefully."
"Speaker 1","00;53;47;27","00;54;10;11","So what do you think about that? Or does that I'll put up this slide where we had separated out this off motor control theory with a value only. That's the one thing that this robot is tracking is the slope. And the altitude it's following is uphill as much as it can, so it can get to the top of Mount Value."
"Speaker 1","00;54;11;00","00;54;40;07","Whereas in active inference, we're using the Helmholtz decomposition, which is related to the physics of flow on vector fields that is going to reduce to these two irreducibly separated components. So like they're totally orthogonal, they don't have redundant information, they have totally separate information. There is the value component, the straight line, but there's also this equal value solenoid or flow, any thoughts on that."
"Speaker 2","00;54;43;16","00;54;44;24","He explained it really well."
"Speaker 1","00;54;46;10","00;55;20;25","Here's a comment from Dave. If people are thinking, giving oneself instructions can refer to something real and useful. If one interprets the execution of the instruction appropriately, I'm referring to playing a piece of music without touching the instruments which can be nearly as effective as actually playing. If the challenge is to simply touch the right stops at the right moments, this can actually be more effecting empowered machine operators may seem less efficient than highly regimented ones, but may over time get to far more effective overall operations being."
"Speaker 1","00;55;20;25","00;55;22;07","What do you think about that?"
"Speaker 2","00;55;22;26","00;55;37;14","Well, again, I completely agree. OK, yeah. So Mike, my only question is, so why are more people not picking up on the potential of this and the value of having both an awareness, both."
"Speaker 3","00;55;39;25","00;56;14;02","So I think like it's maybe just getting started in a computational way. I mean, we've we've explored some computation papers looking at how to optimize a given task computationally. So I think that it will gain traction. It is just so new. I mean, not active inference as a concept, but the practical applications of Active in France, I think are just starting to be explored and I think that the play aspect is, is important."
"Speaker 3","00;56;14;02","00;56;29;10","I mean, because it's it's like how we learn, right? Exploring or playing or, you know, these types of things give rise to, to real learning, even if it's accidental learning, like not necessarily effort directed."
"Speaker 2","00;56;30;18","00;57;01;18","Yeah, I think I think it's also I think it's something some has to do with a perception that play doesn't necessarily generate value, which is kind of sad because there's so many examples where it does the outcomes of play caused your mind to go off and so many because it's supposed to be about distribution. This is a kind of a way of, of, of encouraging that distribution."
"Speaker 2","00;57;01;18","00;57;06;13","And yet for some reason, it just doesn't get the same respect."
"Speaker 1","00;57;07;09","00;57;46;27","So I'm just thinking about the pipeline from basic to translational to applied to sort of infused research. Like once everybody knows that, you know, that what was once basic though becomes applied and then becomes every day. So let's just imagine that we're going to shooting on that skilled performance slide. Well, if we have implicitly or explicitly, if we're working under this optimal motor control function, we're thinking, OK, maybe people's biomechanics differ, but for each person's biomechanics, there is an optimal way to shoot a free throw."
"Speaker 1","00;57;47;19","00;58;32;07","And we want people to have more accurate modeling of where their hand is on the ball so that they can execute the movement better, so that we can get the reward, you know, scored points, put the ball in the hoop. And so it relates to having people practice or maybe get input on your hand was a little bit off here relative to the coaches expectations of where the hand should be but then there's this whole question about visualization and about what Dave was saying, like playing the music without touching the instrument and the ability that was almost discovered in a bottom up way of changing beliefs about one's performance, rehearsing mentally."
"Speaker 1","00;58;32;19","00;59;08;06","But also changing beliefs about performance, influencing motor behavior that is more consistent with what we see in active inference and so there's just multiple things that previously would be seen as sort of exceptions or quirks of a pure motor control system, like incorporating these deeper elements of our generative model all the way up to even like the psychological like maybe your generative model is that your team is fated to lose."
"Speaker 1","00;59;08;20","00;59;29;25","So then you do choke in that moment because like, you know, you didn't psychologically want to win or whatever. And that's as deep as we're always joking about, like the interview with the athletes right after the game. It's like I want it to win or something like that. Like they're not going to give you that third person. My hand, you know, was on the wrong spot on the ball."
"Speaker 1","00;59;31;15","01;00;02;26","It just we're seeing how now, as we have just like Blue said, more computational modeling, the recognizes interaction ism and that recognizes deep generative models. It will be possible to start to slide some of these examples from being like quirky outliers to actually sketching out the structure of inference and action instead of just being seen as sort of like this one weird trick that's going to help you learn free throws."
"Speaker 1","01;00;03;12","01;00;17;21","It'll be like that's always about your generative model and that includes you as being a team player, for example. It always is going to include that and then it's going to come down to maybe being modeled better by active inference rather than a reward based framework. Blue."
"Speaker 3","01;00;19;05","01;00;39;07","So I just was thinking like you know, in your you said you were exploring like the dynamic year you're going through the dynamic there was like exploration and then doing something intentionally, like learning how to do it. And then like perfecting a skill. Right. I was thinking like you left off the end of that, like, just like from a societal standpoint, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;00;39;07","01;01;14;09","Like we explore new things like not thinking as an organism, but thinking as, as a social structure. We explore new things. We set out the intention to complete those new things. We perfects those new things and then we forget them like so. So does that come into play in, in this, I wonder, because I think about scaling active inference a lot like from not in the way that we talked about scaling active inference in the paper, scaling active inference, but, but just as, as from like small components of a system to systems and you know, in that scaling like so are we missing something about, about forgetting, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;01;14;09","01;01;30;15","Like, like handwriting. If you think about like learning cursive, you know, that was something like people start out scribbling on paper. Little kids, you know, they're playing and they're drawing and whatever. And then they they intend to learn cursive. They prefer cursive. But but as a society, we're not teaching that anymore. So they don't know cursive. And it's like typing."
"Speaker 3","01;01;30;15","01;01;56;08","Like now we have voice translation, so we don't know typing anymore. I mean, at these types of things, like are influential in a society. So does that come into play here? Like where I've talked about before, you know, thinking about doing something like entering the flow state. Right. When we talked about the flow last live stream, you know, it's like you have the intention to do something and like you think about doing something, but when you're really a skilled performer, you enter that flow state and you forget about doing it."
"Speaker 3","01;01;56;08","01;02;18;01","You just do it. It's just magically accomplished. So is that like flow state comparable to this like forgetting of as in society? Right. So, so when you enter that flow state and like you're doing something magically like just with your kinesthetic memory and your perfect of it, does that compare to society like forgetting a task because we've already mastered it?"
"Speaker 3","01;02;18;01","01;02;23;10","Like we're, we forgot about that. We're on to the next thing. I wonder if that's relevant anyway. So if I rambles."
"Speaker 1","01;02;24;04","01;02;56;19","Know it's really nice. Here's what it made me think about was instructions again, implicitly or explicitly, they have to be remembered or forgotten because if they're not remembered along the chain or at least in the ram of the computer, it's like they're never carried out. If the instruct if you started the sentence and they forgot what the first part was, by the end of the step, they can't carry out the instructions so instructions we think about symbolic representation, remembering and forgetting, but with interactions it doesn't have to be remembered or forgotten."
"Speaker 1","01;02;56;19","01;03;32;03","It's actually just experienced, like in the ant colony, the interactions between ants, they don't have to be remembered. It updates the generative model of each estimate and then they continue on their path. But it's actually just experienced. And that's enough in an interaction framework rather than being remembered. I'm not sure if that gets added. I think it's a great point about how as something becomes more pervasive and other skills and scaffolds are layered over it, there is a forgetting that can happen."
"Speaker 1","01;03;32;28","01;03;58;26","But also just it's like we don't even need to have memorization of everything. Like I remember hearing from different college majors and somebody would say, somebody would say what major they were and somebody else would say, Oh, well, that one always was too much memorization. Like that was too much memorizing. And then for that person, it wouldn't be who it was their major, it wouldn't be too much memorizing it just seemed like it was parts of the bigger picture."
"Speaker 1","01;03;58;26","01;04;07;20","And so they didn't feel like they were memorizing little factoids, but rather just interacting with the material not sure. Dean, what do you think about that?"
"Speaker 2","01;04;07;21","01;04;35;26","Oh, Blue, you didn't say this, but you touched on something that's mattered to me for a really long time, and that is should we scale bottom up or does it sort of exist in its own realm? Because that's the thing that you basically said, I, I, I taught for a lot of time and it bothered me greatly that all the learning from, from haptic movement was disappear into a keyboard."
"Speaker 2","01;04;37;01","01;05;17;26","So, so, so we top down that one and then we forgot about it because top down basically erased the bottom up. We seem to think that if we top down it, if we, if we give it an out, we can now forget about it. And I find that fun, that crazy because I've had many quite, quite heated debates with people who want to take another bottom up exercise where we can really learn something and get some joy out of discovery and say, well, that's I'm going to scale that and I say, Leave it alone, leave it alone."
"Speaker 2","01;05;17;26","01;05;27;20","It's a bottom up thing. What do you do it? I know you can top down it, but why can't we just let it explore a little bit and figure things out for itself?"
"Speaker 3","01;05;28;28","01;05;43;19","So did you really touched on something there with like the haptic movement and you know, I like personally learned super well by writing things down. Like, I take notes, I fill the notes the way I never look back at them again."
"Speaker 2","01;05;43;19","01;05;45;05","The processing, it's."
"Speaker 3","01;05;45;05","01;06;03;06","The act of physically writing something down that helps me learn. And I mean, sometimes I do look back in my notes, but mostly not I just take them to to commit things to memory. And, you know, my daughter was really struggling with learning her timetables, right? She's like doing these flashcards and the Quizlet app and all this stuff."
"Speaker 3","01;06;03;12","01;06;24;09","And I had her manually copy, you know, like the timetables and, you know, instantly, like within a month she had them down and just like destroyed the standardized tests, like where they do math computation, which is just like rote memorization of your math facts and how fast can you do it? She got like 100% and she's, you know, like off the charts for her grade level in testing."
"Speaker 3","01;06;24;09","01;06;48;05","So anyway, it's it's really very real and actual. But but in that kinesthetic memory and this goes back to that like motor commands, you know, and like the disappearance of the motor command. And so this is like what I think about like these two juxtapositions. And I think like there is a space like where you do issue a motor commands that like at least for me, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;06;48;07","01;07;09;13","Like there is a space where it's like, OK, I need to put my right foot in front of my left foot and, you know, walk along to learn to balance. Like I'm issuing a command to myself to execute some tasks. But but there are many times like where you do not issue that motor commands. I mean, like think about like if you've ever tried to learn to play the piano, like placing your fingers on the keys and stuff and then it just you just do it right."
"Speaker 3","01;07;09;13","01;07;26;10","Like there's no command at that space. And so so there's like a mental a kinesthetic, like something that happens the way you transition between having to issue the command and not having to issue the command. And this is something that I, you know, I'm excited to to talk to the authors about if they are able to join us on a livestream."
"Speaker 3","01;07;26;10","01;07;37;11","Is that because I don't know, where is that stuff? Where does that step get a race inactive inference I mean, we aren't always just we aren't always commandlets, I think. I don't know."
"Speaker 2","01;07;38;18","01;08;00;20","I just put one more one last thing on that. If if I think of myself, if I think of myself separately from the neck down, everything from the neck down, giving me the bottom up, my my brain is way up here. There's things that are supporting that that are giving me that chance to bottom up. I don't want those things to disappear."
"Speaker 2","01;08;00;20","01;08;28;10","I don't want to be ahead on a on a cart. I don't want to be like that plant with just my head going back and forth between lights, like, when do we stop saying that everything has to end? I could say you didn't say this, but I've had so many people say, oh, Dean, if you if you all this stuff that you're doing is great, and you you create all these unicorns and all these young people are able to go out and contribute in professional settings, but it's not scalable."
"Speaker 2","01;08;29;03","01;08;40;18","And I go what? What do you mean it's not scalable? Every one of these things is a bottom up example that it it can happen as long as you don't try to top down it to death."
"Speaker 1","01;08;45;00","01;09;17;09","Interesting. The part about the body and the neck reminds me of Ken Wilbur's center stage of development, which is sort of like along the integral psychological trajectory, there's a step where it's like half human, half horse. And so it's like one step beyond kind of a human in dialog with a horse. As two separate entities, there starts to be like a fusion in his framework moving towards non dual framings."
"Speaker 1","01;09;17;25","01;09;36;29","But there's that stage where it's like the top down to the bottom up. But, you know, our brain is further out just gravitationally, so it makes it seem like it's the top down piece. But you know, what about a person upside down that is it. What about signaling?"
"Speaker 2","01;09;37;20","01;09;41;23","Oh, you've already pointed a is on the edge of a building back there, about ten slides."
"Speaker 1","01;09;41;26","01;10;20;08","Or people on the other side of the world, they're upside down and I think asking about speech and sign language could be interesting because I think those are going to be the challenge cases for symbolic, the last bastion of constructionism and symbolic messages being passed maybe is happening through language. Whereas with this sort of elegant, skillful performance model, maybe you go, OK, I can see where predictive processing is coming into play where it's not just about value."
"Speaker 1","01;10;20;08","01;10;49;17","OK, so if predictive processing is an improvement from reinforcement learning or from optimal motor control, then I guess I could see why active inference builds upon predictive processing. So that's the that's the pipeline. The active down the rabbit hole pipeline for some. But I think when it actually is semantic or symbolic, what is being performed that'll be where on one hand there's going to be resistance because it's going to seem the most instruction us."
"Speaker 1","01;10;50;08","01;11;11;11","But on the other hand, I think we're going to tap into the richness of active inference to have a deep generative model, including semantic information, whereas the semantics are not in this motor control framing so it'll be like double or nothing with active inference for some of the symbolic cases. Blue."
"Speaker 3","01;11;12;28","01;11;35;04","Yeah, I just wanted to go back to what Dean was saying earlier about bottom up and like, I don't know, like using active inference and modeling active inference in like a bottom up and nested way is super, super interesting to me. And I just I'm wondering, like, when are we going to crack that walnut because it's going to happen."
"Speaker 3","01;11;35;05","01;11;39;01","I feel like we're we're teetering on the edge of, of that."
"Speaker 1","01;11;39;24","01;11;44;26","What will that look like? I mean, yeah, what will it look like or what will be a system where we can explore it."
"Speaker 3","01;11;44;26","01;11;51;06","And I mean, maybe the active inference, I think is maybe maybe Daniel will grace us with we get to do his paper one day."
"Speaker 1","01;11;51;29","01;11;52;24","We can do it soon."
"Speaker 2","01;11;53;20","01;12;18;19","But yeah, the only thing I'll add is that we have to people that are participating in this and really are going, oh, my goodness, we're really on the cusp of something. Just have to be willing to go over the edge of the cliff. And I'm not and I'm not joking. It's the letting go of all the habits that we formed to get to this place because most people didn't get it."
"Speaker 2","01;12;18;19","01;12;44;06","We didn't the three of us didn't get here through active inference. That came after a whole bunch of things that were more instructional. And to want to step back, it would be much easier than to go over. If we've got the prospecting proposition and the provisions in place, we'll go over the edge and it'll all be fine. It'll be actually be quite thrilling."
"Speaker 1","01;12;46;07","01;13;07;19","I really like that, like sort of that come to the edge. There's a different thought chain when you're climbing the ladder to the high jump. Like we've all jumped off of something that was scary or something like that. There's a different thought process when you're climbing. Maybe because your motor behavior is grounded, you're on the ladder or you're on the mountain going up."
"Speaker 1","01;13;08;10","01;13;35;20","That's one mode that's actually like approach. But then right at the end, the mind goes blank and you know, the mind will say, jump, jump, jump. But there's that resistance. And that reminds me one of the few times that I've used VR goggles. It was like you walked into an elevator. This was like a scenario walk into an elevator, and then it carried you up a building and you could see yourself getting higher and higher up."
"Speaker 1","01;13;36;06","01;13;58;13","And then the elevator doors opens and you looked down and it was just like dropping off a building and it felt like my foot was just glued to the ground. Like I felt like I could not take a step forward, even though I could inch my foot forward and I could see that it was that I hadn't moved, that I was still just on flat ground."
"Speaker 1","01;13;59;00","01;14;23;11","It was like it just stopped motor behavior to know that it would be resulting in some unpleasant situations in the usual case. So, Dean, what do we say to those who are not sure if they want to go to the cliff? What do we say to those who are walking towards a cliff? And then what do we do with those who are on the edge."
"Speaker 2","01;14;23;23","01;14;56;04","This is this is fantastic question because this is this is the nature of the problem. OK, so so do you want do you want instructional ism extended into the active inference role, or do you realize that whatever identity you take on in terms of learning with both eyes open with some instructional isn't meant some interaction ism? I don't know what that will be for you or blue or or me."
"Speaker 2","01;14;56;04","01;15;28;13","I just know it won't be an extension of instruction ism alone. I don't that's the counterfactual here. I don't know what that will feel like as different any more than you knew what the difference was going to be in terms of releasing to gravity as opposed to pushing against it as you were climbing up those stairs. I just know that if you considered it to be just two more stairs as an extension of what you were already doing, you're going to be disappointed."
"Speaker 2","01;15;29;15","01;16;01;21","So I think it's that that is the that's the big question here. As long as you don't as long as when I used to say to kids, as long as you don't think that a field researcher is simply and an intern outside of school, I don't know what that's going to feel like. And I certainly don't know what that's going to look like because I'm not out there with you and your sponsor so how can you let go of what you know in order to realize this thing that nobody can give you a direct answer to?"
"Speaker 2","01;16;02;24","01;16;26;28","That's that's a that's a beautiful question, Daniel, because that that for active inference is going to be the that's the rule that's going to have to be discovered that that even people who are spending a lot of time focusing on this right now, getting it formalisms and and developing the the way to formalize the math are going to have that themselves."
"Speaker 2","01;16;26;28","01;16;30;28","Otherwise, it's just going to be an extension of instructional ism. And that would be sad."
"Speaker 1","01;16;32;09","01;16;46;23","Hmm. Yep. It's like jumping off. It's not a staircase in reverse. Right. And I think the idea would be maybe we already have flight suit on where it's like if you."
"Speaker 2","01;16;48;05","01;16;49;01","Have provision."
"Speaker 1","01;16;49;04","01;17;13;00","You climb, you climb up with the provisions and then, you know, when you jump, you're going to be able to do something that was just qualitatively different. It's going to feel different. It's going to be different, it's going to be a different action. And wasn't the point of listening to instructions to change to update, to be better or to be different?"
"Speaker 1","01;17;13;25","01;17;38;01","And then it's like by being different and following that path, we become who we are. Like somebody said, I always wanted to be skilled in this martial art. So then they trained along the way to become who they wanted to be, and that was them being who they wanted to be. It's a lot of sort of loose associations, but again, I think we're working towards making it happen."
"Speaker 2","01;17;38;18","01;18;00;29","It is. It it isn't though, because instructional ism. My point was that the instruction stopped. I cannot give you a description of what that will look and feel like, so you're going to have to interact with it. That's there's not it's not a negotiable if you really want to be there you have to let go of the instructional ism."
"Speaker 2","01;18;01;13","01;18;29;07","So I don't think that's a loose association that's non-negotiable. Now, you may not like it and you may not go there. You may step back from the edge, and that's fine. But don't think that I or other people that are actually looking at active inferences as a second eye open won't be aware of what's what you're transpiring, whether you're going over or whether you're stepping back that's not a loose association."
"Speaker 2","01;18;29;07","01;18;31;12","That's that's pretty clear."
"Speaker 1","01;18;33;29","01;18;48;27","Lou. Any thoughts on that? I guess my question would be, let's just stay with this sort of like climbing the instructions to get to the space of interactions. What? Yeah, blue got."
"Speaker 3","01;18;50;04","01;19;12;08","It. Just as like climbing the instructions to get to the space of interactions. Like I feel like something is there that is has to do with like the bottom up and the scaling like, you know, in the systems like we are climbing the instructions as parts of a system until we get to to that space as a system yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;19;15;17","01;19;54;12","The rules well it's like, OK, we have the ladder going up or you know, staircase going up to the jumping off point you could frame that in terms of instructions. Go to the second step, go to the third step, go to the fourth step instruction ism all the way I mean, our interaction is all the way. It's like it gives you the rule walk forward so you can replace on a structured ascension and you can replace the sequential instructions with a rule or a pattern so that it's interaction ism all the way down, all the way up."
"Speaker 1","01;19;54;25","01;20;17;17","And that kind of relates to the emphasis scale free framework like bottom up from where blue are you going to start with subatomic or where is the kernel going to be? And maybe just interactions all the way down and then at some sufficient level, you can granular eyes or you can screen and you can make something look as if it has instructions."
"Speaker 3","01;20;19;07","01;20;34;18","So I wonder if it's like you know, you see this loop, right, the active inference loop and it's like an oval like this. And so I wonder if it's like starts to be like the structure of an atom, like, OK, there's like this oval that's this way. And then I wonder if I could superimpose one going the other way."
"Speaker 3","01;20;34;18","01;20;54;17","I've vertical and horizontal like a little one of these things, right? You know, so that, you know, because there's this across scales as we scale up and down, you know, is there a loop going between and then a loop going this way? Possibly. Probably. I don't know. I think about it in that way."
"Speaker 1","01;20;55;10","01;21;18;13","So this could be the s orbital. This is just like a spherical one. And maybe there's other trajectories or flows that have different shapes. So Dave wrote in there and anyone else in this last little bit is welcome to write a comment. Dave wrote, In most effective military units, troops are told what to accomplish, not what to do."
"Speaker 1","01;21;19;03","01;21;53;23","So that's the difference between for me, like push and pull. Push, you know, lift. The bar is like it's a command about what to do versus like when it's an accomplishment. And so it's the tliose for the end directness that pulls the person. And then in that poor there is the space to have the soul and oil flow to to walk straight towards the goal where there's a clear path but then to be like, oh yeah, but then there's I'm hitting a wall."
"Speaker 1","01;21;54;01","01;22;18;26","So in order to accomplish, I do have to walk around. Of course, that makes sense in the context of being pulled by a goal, but that's where the instruction based robotics always fails because any time there's something that requires a deviation from value you need a total second layer of the model to reintroduce curiosity or epistemic gain into the value framework."
"Speaker 1","01;22;20;11","01;22;37;25","So then it's this question How do you balance all these second layer bolt ons so that you can still salvage your value driven model, even when there's aspects that are just clearly better framed within a pragmatic epistemic distinction?"
"Speaker 3","01;22;37;25","01;22;58;02","Blue Yeah, it's like solving the problem without ground truth data, right? So how do we you know, we don't know if we've never been exposed to this before. It's a programed into our robotic function, you know, how do we account for that? Right. So I think that that's where the exploration and the play comes in."
"Speaker 1","01;22;58;12","01;23;29;25","Or maybe tossing and turning like you want to be comfortable and then it just sort of uncoordinated behavior. That's just rummaging around searching for something in a box or all these examples where it's so you couldn't say that that twist of your side, it was it's not skillful, at least for me, but it's also not reward driven. Again, you need a way second level both on to be explaining how the rummaging behavior is itself value driven."
"Speaker 1","01;23;29;27","01;23;48;13","You can say that there is a value that's pulling or you want the valuable thing in that box. But that's we all agree on that. We all agree that there's something valuable in the box and that search behavior is going to be required. Are we going to have a process theory that allows for exploration and then zeroing in on a goal?"
"Speaker 1","01;23;48;28","01;23;57;00","Or will we have a process theory that tries to go like, well, if the end is valuable, then let's just back propagate value?"
"Speaker 3","01;23;59;00","01;24;12;25","Yeah. Or or if we don't know if we don't know what's valuable in the box, right? Something is valuable in here, but how do we find out what is it that's valuable? OK, so we implement the search function, but then exploring what is the valuable item out of 50 items in the box, right?"
"Speaker 1","01;24;14;15","01;25;00;27","Yep. It's almost like in the simplest cases the value learning is defensible when we have this hill climbing robot on a single hill. OK, but now you've got a triple bottom line. You got the financial success, but you also have environmental and social considerations of a business. So will you reduce all three of them to one of them or try to generate a fourth standard that you're going to reduce them all like a common currency for all of your values and rewards or could there be a deep generative model where the organization has preferences in the financial, social and environmental realm and then take stock of its action possibilities not even described in the value"
"Speaker 1","01;25;00;27","01;25;35;23","mindset. Maybe every time you have a meeting, it's like square zero, what can we do? Whereas in active inference, we start with the space of policies, the affordances that the niche provides. And so you don't need to consider policies that cannot be done and you should relate policies accordingly to how likely or tractable they are. So there's just so many ways that we see that the mathematical framings get expanded on through relaxation of some of their attributes."
"Speaker 1","01;25;35;23","01;26;03;11","Just like first in 2011 wrote, which is that optimal control can be classed as active inference with three simplifications. And then he walked through those which we discussed a little bit last time. But this is kind of cool how we're building out some differences between the motor control approaches that have been used in the past and active inference as a process theory."
"Speaker 1","01;26;03;11","01;26;22;01","And then the way that that encompasses what we've seen before. And then maybe also opens up the discussion into just areas that weren't even considered like we can add in affordances plus preferences in."
"Speaker 2","01;26;22;15","01;26;39;06","There that I think that embodied skillful and active inference implies a huge leap of faith back to that jumping off the. Because it is I mean, that's a that's a that's a cliche that people can probably appreciate."
"Speaker 1","01;26;40;07","01;26;42;21","What do you think the trust or faith is in?"
"Speaker 2","01;26;43;10","01;26;49;20","Yeah, that's it. You're selling yourself, right? Or lack thereof."
"Speaker 1","01;26;51;23","01;27;47;23","Act or act not. There is no infer. No, there is. There is so it's interesting. Yeah. How how can we distill the similarities and differences so that when we see one of those limitations being like, OK, we had curiosity slash pragmatic plus some systemic so that when we see a sort of here's a new hack on value, we can see that as a saddle points for where that model could move to towards an active inference framing just by kind of rewiring some of the modules that it has here's a great question from the live chat."
"Speaker 1","01;27;48;05","01;28;00;29","Bill wrote, Would a priority parameter according to depletion levels of different resources be applicable yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;28;00;29","01;28;03;10","That's back to the pulse thing. Yeah, I would say yes."
"Speaker 1","01;28;06;07","01;28;30;15","OK, Dean with the pools here would be my thought from the multi scale decision making. Let's just think about a B colony. The resources that they need to forage for include like pollen, which has a lot of protein and fat and is helpful for the developing larva. Then nectar, which is like high octane gasoline, a lot of carbs good for the adults."
"Speaker 1","01;28;31;12","01;28;58;09","And then depending on the environment they might need like water or salt or other different resources. So the depletion of there might be an imbalance of the nutrients and you can think about that. Similarly, for an organism like rapid starvation, when you only eat protein, your body will enter a starvation mode because, you know, other fats and stuff are needed so definitely multiple resources are being balanced."
"Speaker 1","01;28;58;09","01;29;28;12","And part of the challenge of decision making under uncertainty, just as we've been getting at, is that there's not just one kind of outcome, like it's enough to be uncertain about value. But now when we're thinking about these multi dimensional resource landscapes, whether it's just protein versus carbs or whether it's a lot more nuanced, like the triple bottom line, we really do need a principled way of talking about the relative depletion of different resources."
"Speaker 1","01;29;28;23","01;29;54;26","So in the bee colony case selection has shaped meets so that they use the rate and the type of interactions they have in order to update their investment level behavior. So I'm having a lot of interactions with Hungry Larva. Maybe we need more pollen. I'm having a lot of interactions with food reservoirs. Maybe that can slow me down because we probably have enough forage for now."
"Speaker 1","01;29;55;21","01;30;40;22","So colonies that don't consist of estimates with that productive way of interpreting their interactions not instructions, those colonies are swept off the table. And so we end up seeing distributed systems succeed where they act as if there is a correct prioritization amidst uncertainty of different kinds of resources. And then if we use active inference instrumentally, in the deep generative model of the bodies, nutrient ratios or the colonies relative balance between protein and carbs, then it's as if there is a priority parameter where when something is depleted, it's the one that's prioritized."
"Speaker 1","01;30;41;04","01;31;17;17","But we don't need that expressively in the model. We can have a multi dimensional generative model of different resources and then actions will be selected according to their expected free energy being minimized, almost going along the curve that takes us on that edge of explore and exploit from wherever we are in that resource depletion landscape towards our preferences so I would be totally open to hearing other explanations."
"Speaker 1","01;31;17;17","01;31;41;06","Or maybe there is a priority parameter that can come into play but one sort of longer response would be organisms do act adaptively to prioritize depleted resources but that doesn't mean that there needs to be a parameter in our model that explicitly prioritizes specific resources. It's enough just to have a preference factor that includes multiple types of resources."
"Speaker 3","01;31;41;21","01;31;54;20","Blue now I think that that's right. I think the right. So you can make it as simple or complicated as you want, but I always think less parameters in the models, better."
"Speaker 1","01;32;01;03","01;32;30;23","It just makes me think, you know, how do we get those preferences? And then what happens when the niche changes so that preferences that were adaptive like to act as if prioritization of sugar and salt overall other preferences, for example, what happens when the situation changes? So how do we integrate high precision priors with highly accurate sensory input?"
"Speaker 1","01;32;31;03","01;32;59;10","That's something we've talked about before. How do we get the best of both worlds with being able to like fly blind because we have a deep generative model, but then also when there is sensory input, that requires a categorical shift in cognitive model. For example, we want to have the fluidity to do that, and we don't want to be wasting our time in one mode when it's the wrong mode."
"Speaker 1","01;32;59;10","01;33;05;00","We want to be hard when hardness is a floor or be soft. One softness is a flaw."
"Speaker 3","01;33;06;26","01;33;33;12","So I wonder if there's like, you know, I mean, for organisms like bees and birds, like there's some programed. I mean, things are shifting all the time, right? Like there's, you know, a huge amount of like migratory stuff that comes into play and hibernating and all these things, right? And so like for us, like we notice that prioritized like shifts like I need water right now, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;33;33;15","01;33;56;17","Like, you know, we're suddenly like parched, right? Like the need for water is overwhelming, but there's not this like this because we have offloaded so much of our needs into our niche. Like the need for it to stay warm or whatever. We build houses, we were clothes, so we've offloaded a lot of this stuff. So I wonder if it's like the instincts becomes less instinctual."
"Speaker 3","01;33;56;17","01;34;12;02","I wonder if that's if that happens, like the instincts for to sequester food or fly south for the winter or these types of things just because, you know, we don't we don't we've just offloaded our need to do those things. So it just becomes I don't know."
"Speaker 1","01;34;13;14","01;35;00;26","There I think that's another distinction here. Here we can include extended slash embedded, you know, forties, seventies, 11 years, however many there are, we can at least frame those situations in terms of niche modification or niche construction. Where is that in motor control? It's nowhere. Where is the golf club with a squishy handle that is being, you know, interacted with as an instrument we don't have those nice interfaces, whereas active inference has excellent interfaces quantitatively and qualitatively for being in rich by pieces that are, as I would say, maybe non-negotiable for the actual creature, but it'd be totally ad hoc."
"Speaker 1","01;35;00;26","01;35;19;00","Where would you put the instrumentation in here? Is it a state estimate or should I be estimating where my golf club is, or is it enough just to estimate my hands and the angle of the hands and then do another second level prediction not quite clear. You could probably implement it multiple ways. And here's another nice comment from Dave."
"Speaker 1","01;35;19;19","01;35;48;18","So Dave said the term in cybernetics so it's always good to connect back to related areas for putting drives into a model is all good. OK, so here's the definition of organic comes from, I guess, algos, meaning pain and you don't meaning pleasure. Sorry, Dave, for the mispronunciation, putting multiple organic drives like pains and pleasures may yield complex, instructive behaviors, but there are so many advantages in having a model."
"Speaker 1","01;35;48;25","01;36;13;10","I think active inference, so sophisticated that it generates its drives. The drives come out of the model rather than being put in. So yes. And he wrote then clarifying, I mean, the innumerable drives emerge from the models, internal dynamics. If your robot is spontaneously curious, spontaneously attends to events or response of externals, it's as if it has a curiosity parameter."
"Speaker 1","01;36;13;24","01;36;45;23","So it's true. Maybe we could even write like drives, quote, you know, as if I'm going to I'm going to take Shakespeare. Thanks, Hamlet. You are great. A great prince drives wheel drives emerged from Model don't need to be put in. So instead of like maybe the rabbit being put in the hat, this is like the rabbits emerged from the hat."
"Speaker 1","01;36;45;23","01;37;07;28","If you put in enough hydrogen and enough time. So that's interesting to think about where cybernetic models come into play here. So let's give just a few final minutes. All right. Any final questions in the chat and thanks, of course, to Dave and to Phil for the great questions."
"Speaker 1","01;37;12;02","01;37;42;11","We can just think about maybe dot one Dean is being on the edge dot zero is climbing. And so it's a two directional trail, you know, as people going up to Half Dome and there's people coming down, so does zero is to directional highway, lots of on ramps and off ramps. But we try to make the topics accessible for those who are not in the active inference game, but they're related."
"Speaker 1","01;37;42;12","01;38;13;22","They're familiar with related topics like the keywords usually. And in the zero, we're going to go from bridging the keywords and the topics of broader concern to active inference. So that's the onramp to active inference. But then also for those who are already in the active inference mode of learning by doing and working, then it's their window out to like, oh, wow, you know, this idea that I had been working on active inference in one context, it's also applying outwards."
"Speaker 1","01;38;14;04","01;38;48;29","So that's in the dot, the 0.1, you know, who whoever and whenever it is, we are in the, the bathtub face, the part between the bookend starts, we're at the edge and we can look back to the dot zero and see again recapping the steps that we took. But also we want to start looking out and then I don't know where dot to would be, but dot two is when we sort of take the next step and."
"Speaker 2","01;38;50;13","01;39;19;22","That the dot to is the no going back. I mean, I can add a twist to the fact that I'm I'm going to be hitting the water soon. And that's a skillful, embodied movement. Right? We actually like people that do the ten meter platform an inadequate a few things before they hit the water and regain control. But I, I, I think this is, this is what interacts and ism is versus instructional ism."
"Speaker 2","01;39;21;00","01;39;35;04","I mean the way that this is set up the 012 is interaction ism. It's more about this than it is about bi directionality. And I think you talked about at the beginning of today's episode."
"Speaker 1","01;39;36;27","01;40;08;12","Right, we have a structure that we hold to a rail that we could modify as well, but we hold to the rail so that we don't have to frame it like instructions. We weren't instructed to do this. And I don't know, I hope that people don't feel like these are instructions, but rather interactions or engagements with them. And then just like so many other things that we're seeing online, the new technological affordances allow it to actually be an interaction."
"Speaker 1","01;40;08;12","01;40;34;24","We actually can have people asking questions live being a part of the conversation whereas if it were just recording a video and releasing it or record breaking a book and releasing it, it'd be hard to break out of the instruction asset frame because the deliverable would be static and very uni directional. Here we have a different affordance that helps us break out of that frame."
"Speaker 1","01;40;34;24","01;41;09;01","Basically, for free, because even if instructions are being conveyed on the live stream, it would still be within an interaction of participants of individual and collective and of the community. So any final thoughts on one no fun times? Thanks both of you for the the dot zero and dot one fun. We've had a few hours to think about it, but you know, the paper is the distillation of many more hours."
"Speaker 1","01;41;09;01","01;41;13;13","So there's always value, dare I say, and I."
"Speaker 3","01;41;13;14","01;41;13;21","Grab."
"Speaker 1","01;41;15;01","01;41;30;14","Going back and playing with it because it's fun and it's just yep, they're great topics to be considering about and learning. So cool. Thanks everyone for watching. Thanks, Dean and Blue. And we'll see you next week for 23.2."
"Speaker 3","01;41;31;17","01;41;32;04","Thanks, guys."
"Speaker 1","01;41;32;09","01;41;32;23","Bye."
