"Speaker 1","00;00;12;01","00;00;41;01","All right. Greetings, everyone. Welcome to Active Lab Live stream number 23.2. Today's June 15th 2021. And we're going to be having our two discussion on embodied skillful performance where the action is. And we'll see who else joins us live as we go through the slides in the paper. And also, of course, if you're watching live, we'd welcome any questions or comments."
"Speaker 1","00;00;42;15","00;01;05;05","Welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links that are on this slide. This is recorded. Greetings, Dave. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;05;28","00;01;43;04","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams. We're again on June 15th, having our second group discussion on embodied skillful performance where the action is. So this is sort of our jumping off point and let's see if we can make it a skillful one today. The goals are really just to be discussing and learning, to be hearing the questions and points that people found really interesting when they were reading the paper, as well as see where our discussion can spontaneously go."
"Speaker 1","00;01;43;04","00;02;19;04","As of course, participants join and leave and hopefully we get some fun questions from the chat and we're just going to walk through the paper and the slides go where we need to go to hopefully connect some dots. So with that being said, let's just go to the introductions and warm ups and we can each just give an introductory thought on the paper if we would like or something we liked or remembered something we're looking to resolve, reduce our uncertainty on by the end of the discussion."
"Speaker 1","00;02;19;22","00;02;25;24","So I'm Daniel and a postdoctoral researcher in Calif, and I'll pass to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;02;27;14","00;02;40;11","Hi, I'm Dean. I'm in Calgary and I'm coming at a more embedded personality in this active inference lab world and I'll pass it over to Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;02;41;28","00;03;07;27","Hello, I'm Steven I'm based in Toronto. I'm doing a practice based PhD through the UK. I'm interested in participatory theater, community development and ways to understand how people interact with each other in groups and individually. So this paper is quite relevant as it opens up some new avenues in that and I will pass it over to is it is Dave here?"
"Speaker 3","00;03;07;27","00;03;09;03","Dave Hello? Dave."
"Speaker 1","00;03;10;03","00;03;36;27","Yeah, Dave, if you can speak otherwise, no worries. Maybe you're just listening in. So maybe just a quick question. Stephen, where do we see the connection between skillful performance, which is often thought of like motor and bodily? How do we connect that to social practices which are among bodies and use verbal behavior or symbolic behavior?"
"Speaker 3","00;03;38;01","00;04;14;17","Yeah, I mean, this is this is kind of a question I think that's arising more and more as people are trying to question psychology or community psychology, which works on the individual or sociology which works on this sort of mass of people. But when you want to work with into subjectivity and sort of small groups and understanding the dynamics that are going on there, you kind of ask phenomenological questions about what it's like to be in that state, which is kind of a bit more direct than, say, some of psychological perspective on it, but it's still not quite working."
"Speaker 3","00;04;14;18","00;04;37;21","So then you say, well, let's go into action here. Let's get into what's actually happening in and among people and often if you then jump into action, that's another abstract area. But if you're in the area of practice, you're kind of in in between. You know, it's something that people are doing, something that people are doing between each other."
"Speaker 3","00;04;37;29","00;05;03;12","And but you're still able to talk about how it's happening, how it feels. So I think that, that this, this question of practice then, you know, takes you into the sort of areas that get used a lot in arts, arts, practice, theater practice, all these types of areas. So I think it's kind of a nice nexus that's normally a bit impenetrable."
"Speaker 1","00;05;04;17","00;05;44;10","Or it makes me wonder, do groups have skill or is skill something that only bodies have? So you see some football team or basketball team do some very coordinated play or two dancers that are improvising is that able to be reduced entirely to the skills embodied performance of individual bodies, or is there a way in which we could talk about a group embodying skillful performance, especially because so many performances I mean, except for what stand up comedy, a few other things there a group, and then even those individual performances are in feedback."
"Speaker 1","00;05;44;10","00;05;49;13","Sometimes with a group, it's just different roles oh."
"Speaker 3","00;05;50;13","00;06;18;17","That's a good point actually. I mean, I think that's really the exciting field of practice that's going to be growing over the next while. And I sense that it's almost impossible to get that from a snapshot. You have to have something that's progressing over time to get old. Let's just say I don't know whether that's true, but I sense that there's more use in understanding how things change over time and getting the dynamics than there is trying to analyze a snapshot."
"Speaker 1","00;06;22;20","00;06;32;04","Dave, if you have any comments, you can unmute and I'll see it or din any sort of just opening thoughts. How does this start to meet you today?"
"Speaker 2","00;06;35;03","00;07;11;05","But I'm going to come at it from a little different angle. I so I think that we're between is a huge it's the thing that that befuddles us and yet it's the thing that we probably want to know the most about and in this idea of embodying skillful, skillful performance, I was going to actually ask the author some questions around how she relates it back to sort of the the parts of the brain that resolve these problems."
"Speaker 2","00;07;11;05","00;07;36;29","So is it a spatial relationship thing, like what the hippocampus tends to provide us some insight on, or is it a caudate nucleus thing which says that we sequence everything out, we turn left, we turn right, we release the ball. And I was just curious about which because those two things work, but when one is on the other one is off, there's kind of a binary relationship between those two parts of the brain."
"Speaker 2","00;07;36;29","00;07;51;10","And so I wanted to kind of figure out how that that toggling back and forth is part of this skill that we are witnessing Nice point."
"Speaker 1","00;07;51;16","00;08;16;12","There's the more cognitively driven versus almost the more bodily driven and then that handoff is where we see skillful performance and that's where we see choking. It's where we see all these dynamics between cognitive processes and action processes. OK, we see another Dave. Dave, if you can, if you want to give any thoughts, just feel free."
"Speaker 2","00;08;17;13","00;08;19;08","Yeah, I'll just listen again. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;08;19;16","00;08;26;19","Nice. Right on. That's the real that's the real OG way to listen in in the gypsy rather than in the live stream."
"Speaker 1","00;08;29;00","00;08;59;10","Yeah. So we'll see who else joins in today. But that's a great question about the brain pieces. And then I always think about other species, like if insects can have embodied action and that seems pretty fair to say, can they have skillful action and how would we know? And then if they do, the layout of their brain and body is so different that it would map on, you know, they don't have a hippocampus, they don't have a prefrontal cortex, they have other brain regions."
"Speaker 1","00;08;59;28","00;09;26;17","So we don't need to get too locked into one implementation of these processes based upon human neuroanatomy when we know that there's other neuro anatomies that can deploy similar processes. So it helps us keep an open mind to the multiple realizations of active inference or of embodied skillful performance because of just the diversity of evolutionary systems."
"Speaker 1","00;09;28;23","00;10;01;07","Let's take it overview at the roadmap. This paper has a form that we've seen several times before, which is in the first half taking some non active inference body of research so in this case it's skillful performance and optimal motor control theory and investigating with a critical lens. This previous body of research to understand what does it really say or what are the assumptions."
"Speaker 1","00;10;01;07","00;10;47;19","So in this case, there's this instruction, this assumption implicitly or explicitly that's drawn out through the exploration of previous approaches to skillful performance and specifically the motor representations and motor commands that are implicit in optimal motor control theory. So that's part one. Part two goes from optimal control to predictive coding and active inference. And last time we talked a little bit about similarities and differences as you go from optimal motor control to predictive processing to active inference, what is generalized as you move from A to B to see what is different, what kinds of issues might you sidestep or introduce?"
"Speaker 1","00;10;48;12","00;11;17;12","And then in the last sections of the paper, motor control is positively reframed as this interactive sensory motor engagement with a world which puts us very squarely in the domain of active inference rather than in the instruction s domain of optimal motor control theory. Greetings, Blue. So that's kind of a general pattern that we've seen before where the first third of the paper is a background on previous approaches in a critical lens."
"Speaker 1","00;11;17;23","00;11;34;03","The second approach shows some sort of a transition from theory A to B to C, and then by the third part, there's a positive positivist argument as to why active inference is more in line with how things are or might be more useful. Stephen, go ahead."
"Speaker 3","00;11;35;23","00;12;12;03","Yeah. Further to our conversation earlier, I think this actually this this showing the instruction and then the interactive approach is really useful to sort of have a plausible way for affect and social dynamics to interplay with action because when it's under an instruction, this model is kind of hard to imagine how that kind of mechanical, almost message parsing type of approach can integrate into our sort of social dynamics."
"Speaker 3","00;12;12;03","00;12;39;07","Whereas the interaction and this approach does give that. So I think that's quite good. It can frighten people off because it brings in this other philosophical piece, which I think a lot of people do like running away from it first. But actually it does offer a more human humanizing or biological way to engage cool."
"Speaker 1","00;12;39;16","00;13;03;05","Let's just go there, blue, of course, raise your hand anytime you want to something. But this instruction ism versus interaction ism I think is a big piece that we'll walk away from this 23 with. It's something that we can take on in the case of embodied skillful performance, but I think we're going to be able to apply it to education."
"Speaker 1","00;13;03;05","00;13;30;22","We're going to be able to apply it to team collaboration. And so we can definitely return to this distinction between instruction ism and interaction ism. So Steven, just from, you know, your experience with drama or other kinds of work do you think people are how do people implicitly use constructionism versus interaction ism or what kinds of scenarios support or constrain constructionism versus allow for interactions to emerge?"
"Speaker 3","00;13;32;08","00;13;56;20","Well, I I think what tends to happen is in the models that people tend to use, they're kind of either in one camp or another. It's like so mostly it's almost implicit that there's some sort of interactive stroke flow is probably goes even further. It's sort of some sort of flow in the sort of performance arts world. They talk about flow and ease and that type of thing."
"Speaker 3","00;13;57;12","00;14;23;12","And what's also interesting is I know they talk about this in the Michael Chekhov acting approach is this always this battle between ease and form. So a dancer gets more form, they get more technique, they get more proficient their technique, but they might lose that ease that you have as a beginner. So forever trying to add more technique without becoming this kind of rigid or some automaton, you know?"
"Speaker 3","00;14;23;21","00;14;53;22","So I think there's there's that kind of side to it. And that that whole area, they just go off and it's it's kind of it just takes care of itself, but it becomes a little bit of a silo in a way. And then you've got people working in more straight activity theory, bykofsky kind of much more like what activity happened when and that they they, they are also in a bit of a silo."
"Speaker 3","00;14;53;22","00;15;22;00","So I think that you tend to find that and different, different areas, they, they are a little bit siloed in their approaches to sort of get around some of these challenges. So I think that the way of trying to break beyond what you can analyze, which often you have to look at instructionally because you kind of have to break down things into steps."
"Speaker 3","00;15;22;24","00;15;37;10","But that doesn't mean you need to keep it in a stepwise form in terms of how we understand what people really do. So there's this kind of I think there's this kind of gap that this will help to make plausible."
"Speaker 1","00;15;40;26","00;16;03;02","Interesting there how we capture the utility and the apparent advantages of constructionism some of them are written here, like the ability to separate different instructions. That seems pretty important if you say, well, how am I going to cook this multi-stage dish and someone just says, you know, here's all the ingredients and here's all the behaviors, but I'm not going to tell you what order to do what in."
"Speaker 1","00;16;03;17","00;16;26;21","If we can't separate and sequence events, then it's going to be hard to carry out a performance correctly. You can't just switch the order of musical notes and the sheet music. You can't just do things in a different order. So how do we get some of the features that we're looking for, like separate ability of modularity and take it into a fully interaction ist framework?"
"Speaker 1","00;16;28;03","00;17;09;01","One distinction there that the authors raise is like strong versus weak constructionism, and they'll end up continuing that. Both of these forms have similar underpinnings, but there's sort of a continuum between thinking that the instruction ism is completely its own neural representation ism. It's kind of like a Martin Baily type argument. This is the strong constructionism, thinking that it's totally just the neural representations that are entirely specifying on their own the movements that have to be performed versus a more dynamic or coupling version of instruction isms."
"Speaker 1","00;17;09;19","00;17;37;06","So they'd be like, you know, when you're tapping the gas, it's like an instruction to the engine, but it's not the entire go faster cue given the background of ecologically normal processes that enable them to play this role. So that's kind of interesting. Blue any sort of overarching thoughts or any where you think it'd be fun to jump in now?"
"Speaker 4","00;17;37;06","00;17;38;29","I'm just trying to figure out where I'm at."
"Speaker 1","00;17;38;29","00;18;06;29","So indeed, will there be a few other places, like a few other notes that we want to discuss? Dean mentioned one thing maybe we can even have a dot three and find out what a dot three would mean or a dot to point to one or something like that. Dot 21. So one piece was about the, the neural elements because in the figures we do see brains."
"Speaker 1","00;18;08;18","00;18;32;27","However, these are quite schematic. It's not saying that these are the brain regions where these types of things happen, which can be a little ambiguous because it's not actually an anatomical representation yet. It's superimposed on top of a brain. OK, so one piece we wrote down was about the neural and I think there was a few yeah, yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;18;32;27","00;18;33;17","Stephen, go for it."
"Speaker 3","00;18;34;27","00;18;55;05","Yeah, just time is, as you mentioned, about the streak. The weak and strong is kind of interesting because that's kind of trying to give this scientific feel, but it doesn't feel very satisfactory to try and have to say it in terms of weak and strong because you kind of think this well, what does that really mean and how does it shift between the two?"
"Speaker 3","00;18;55;05","00;19;23;18","I mean, I can understand what is being said, but it's it gets into this kind of fuzzy version of instruction ism. So I think that kind of sets up some of these questions that as soon as you move away from a strong instruction ism, it becomes harder to hold it together using the word instruction ism. So I think that's it's quite a good illustration of that because it's sort of you can see how the second paragraphs a lot longer than the first one, basically."
"Speaker 1","00;19;23;18","00;19;49;08","And yet great point. And it's also a common approach to basically rigorous philosophical argument. Instead of making an argument against the total category, you introduce a distinction in the category and then you might find that either one of those categories has some features that the other one doesn't, you know, instead of being against all wars, well, there's the good ones and there's the bad ones."
"Speaker 1","00;19;49;08","00;20;38;25","And then here's my distinction for just the bad ones. Or it could be that by making that distinction, you then can say, actually, this holds true for both of these categories. Or subcategories. And so that's how I've made my claim against all X is by first breaking it down. And then they do again find that there are, of course, are differences between these two forms of constructionism, but that they end up taking on some of the same assumptions cause there's probably a few other pieces we can explore this is the section in the paper that I'm sharing on the screen that says the formulation of sensory motor control in terms of optimal motor control theory"
"Speaker 1","00;20;39;13","00;21;07;27","heavily hinges on two different but highly interconnected assumptions. So let's see what the assumptions are, because it's probable that active inference is going to be contrasting or doing something different. So one is the central specification of the sending motor commands and they're efferent copies in the form of detailed low level instructions for control of the motor plan specified in terms of an intrinsic frame of reference, i.e. extension and contraction of muscle fibers."
"Speaker 1","00;21;09;16","00;21;41;20","So that's that instruction ism. And then to a separation of forward and inverse models operating on complementary aspects of action planning and execution. Awesome. So the first piece is that instruction ism that what's being sent descending or towards the body are instructions. And the second piece is a separation of the forward and the inverse models operating on complementary aspects of action, planning and execution."
"Speaker 1","00;21;42;00","00;22;05;28","So the forward model is like sort of a planning model and then the execution is like, OK, given what I planned, how am I going to execute that? And those are two different streams in optimal motor control and so we've been talking about how interaction ism we can explore, how active inference deploys interaction ism. But in interaction ism, we have a contrast with the instruction is 0.1."
"Speaker 1","00;22;06;20","00;22;25;08","And then through a unified generative model in active inference and the reduction of uncertainty in a unified generative model, we're going to move beyond this separation of these two forward and inverse models. Stephen. And then anyone else or any questions in the life."
"Speaker 3","00;22;26;18","00;22;56;28","Yeah, this is quite helpful. It gives that realization the optimal motor control theory. It could it can be very precise. You could imagine someone making a robot because you can measure everything. You've got access to all the data and you could make something within like a thousandth of a millimeter precision which humans or animals can't do. But it does have a bit of a limitation in terms of being able to integrate."
"Speaker 3","00;22;56;28","00;23;19;28","And I think that I don't know if you've seen any of the papers around the idea of Fields being around the robots joint. So that have like a field around the hand, the field around the and just move into the field rather than trying to work out what the actual muscle, what the actual joints should do. And they, they out competed other robots within like two or three months."
"Speaker 3","00;23;19;28","00;23;50;02","So this same idea of working with some sort of more fuzzy dynamic to build actually and just working out what's works most efficiently or best even though you're probably adding a lot more fuzziness into the actual understanding of the measurements, actually has a lot of them, has a lot of benefits in terms of learning how to do something quickly OK."
"Speaker 1","00;23;50;17","00;24;16;04","I think there'll be a few more cool points to return to on this notion of field, but I think it's also helpful here to look at how they distinguish the forward and the inverse models. So here a Ford model takes the system from an intrinsic to an X extrinsic frame, predicting the effects of different movements using musculoskeletal plans specified by neural activity."
"Speaker 1","00;24;16;04","00;24;44;09","So again, that's that instruction ism that's because we're in the optimal motor control. So forward model is basically plans that can be cognitive into implementations. That's the translation into motor of commands and their consequences. On the other hand, an inverse model builds motor commands by inverting the causal change. So first, that inverse model leverages a value function of states."
"Speaker 1","00;24;44;09","00;25;14;02","This is where we get the in optimal motor control, the non negotiable introduction of value as the central terroristic states have to be assigned value because value is what's used to determine which plans to select. And that leverage on the value function is used to form a mapping from desired target states, which again is built into active inference in a sense through the preference over certain types of states."
"Speaker 1","00;25;14;11","00;25;46;21","But the desired target state has to be specified in a slightly different way as an actual preferred state rather than over a preferences. Overstates in this awful motor control framework and that's in the coordinate system based upon the external consequences of movements. So I want my my arm to be at a 90 degree angle and then that is translated or it's mapped to a set of intrinsic coordinates in the space of muscle fiber activations, like my arm is at a greater than 90 degree angle."
"Speaker 1","00;25;46;21","00;26;17;27","So that needs to map to activation of biceps firing patterns so that the arm can contract, so that the angle is smaller and that's why frameworks based upon optimal motor control are sometimes characterized in terms of force control, because all the motor commands specify is muscle forces and joint talks. So that's kind of the macro to micro mapping is we have preferred states and the question is there's so many degrees of freedom with the joints."
"Speaker 1","00;26;18;09","00;26;49;27","So how do we go from potentially a broad set of preferred states or acceptable states into a specific pattern of muscular activations? So how do you go from make your hand just rest where it's comfortable, which is a relatively broad sort of plateau of accessible states into a position that each joint is going to be at equilibrium with and the two of these assumptions that we've been exploring here."
"Speaker 1","00;26;50;09","00;27;19;19","So again, one, the obstructionism and two, the separation of forward inverse model, that architecture induces the assumption or rests on the assumption that value valuable states is what causes action and that's what that first in 2011 paper introduced is sort of flipped that on its head, which is that well in models from omc t sequences of action are selected according to the value function of their states."
"Speaker 1","00;27;20;04","00;28;15;23","So value is something that's cognitive and induces action but that gets sort of flipped in the 2011 perspective because value is a function of the states, not a cause of them. So yeah, as written here, value is an attribute of states that are caused by movement. It's a consequence, not a cause and when we get loops, you know which ones, a cause of which something that's local locally A causes B but then you pull back A level and maybe the relationship can also be seen as sort of the other direction or maybe with feedback systems or embodied systems, we move beyond just any single linear framing of what causes what, but regardless of the direction"
"Speaker 1","00;28;15;23","00;28;45;20","or whether value is an attribute a states or it's a consequence or it's a cause, the point is there still is this central value parameter in optimal motor control theory and that value parameter, which is familiar to reinforcement learning like learning preferable states based upon their predicted value. That's something that we're going to be able to build on in active inference by pursuing not just value, but also allowing for reduction of uncertainty in a generative model."
"Speaker 1","00;28;45;29","00;28;54;11","Which could include pragmatic or value driven elements, but also elements that include curiosity like drives. Stephen and then anyone else."
"Speaker 3","00;28;55;27","00;29;38;27","And this ties in with Kaspar Hess work with Affect. You could imagine that the affective states are kind of generated on the fly at different scales. So as you start to move maybe slowly as you practice you these value states are kind of almost revealed and not necessarily available. And then maybe there's a state, but once the whole action's complete and that gives you an end to that value state, which may be only appears as that degree of surprise all is realized and it's always going to be slightly different each time you do something."
"Speaker 3","00;29;38;27","00;29;40;11","So this this is quite cool."
"Speaker 1","00;29;43;20","00;30;20;08","I've moved here to that kind of vector field representation of the difference between value only learning and performance. Here's our robot who's only interested in kind of taking a ruler, putting it on the hill and then going in the direction of the ruler going uphill. That's the sort of scalar approach to pursuing peaks. In contrast, we have that pick climbing or hill climbing element in active inference as that irritation or longitudinal currents."
"Speaker 1","00;30;20;24","00;31;03;27","But we also get this solid oil element. So I'm wondering, talking to people about performance, for example, or training in some way how would it be different to promote this sort of value, an equal value flow model rather than a comparative reward driven model? Like if a learner is constantly assessing whether it's a multiple choice test or whether it's baseball pitching or something like that, the learner is always assessing the value of states and everything is framed as value maximization and you're going to want to be doing accurate states."
"Speaker 1","00;31;04;07","00;31;27;01","You want, you know, the pitch, you want to be getting your pitches more accurate because more accurate is more rewarding. I'm just wondering how it changes training or the experience of practice to know that there's times when one is pursuing value or that in the long range pursuit of value can be achieved through this rotational or exploratory element blue."
"Speaker 1","00;31;27;01","00;31;28;04","And then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;31;30;06","00;31;51;15","So just talking about pitching specifically, like, yeah, you can, you know, hit the bull's eye, right? If you're going to pitch, you know, pitch a ball, you can hit the bull's eye you can hit the target, get it right over home plate. But like you never explore like what about like spinning the ball? What effects will like different spins that you put on the ball have on, you know, the way that the batter hits it."
"Speaker 4","00;31;51;23","00;32;11;24","So like the accuracy versus like the finesse of it. And I think about that in terms of dance also. Like if you're not, you don't explore like, you know what it feels like. Like if you're only trying to accurately make a movement, you're never exploring like the finesse element of it. So there's no like room for perfection or like ultimate mastery."
"Speaker 1","00;32;11;24","00;32;41;09","I think and where does skill become mastery? It's sort of like at least in chess, it's the, the masters who appear to challenge some of the basic rules. Like they don't castle early because there's some deeper plan or a jazz musician who moves beyond the framework of regular timing to introduce some other elements. So that play element becomes especially important."
"Speaker 1","00;32;41;17","00;33;19;08","It's almost like if you never learn how to do it correctly or normatively, you can't throw the baseball, so you got to get it over the plate. But then the mastery level after performance has been demonstrated in sense involves inventing a new way to pitch. Like there's, you know, a fraction of baseball pitchers who throw sidearm or throw knuckleball, all these different sort of unconventional approaches that art, the value function that they learned initially, or maybe it was their biomechanics and that was the value function that worked for them and some other value function just wouldn't have worked with their body and brain."
"Speaker 1","00;33;20;00","00;33;23;23","Stephen And then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;33;23;25","00;33;53;06","Thinking from the perspective of coaching, who's so my supervisors works a lot with systemic coaching and performance coaching is this this becomes a more unifying approach. It might be four specific things. Optimal optimal control theory is quite useful for just unpacking something, but if you want to look at performance coaching more broadly or developmental coaching more broadly and how they relate this could be useful."
"Speaker 3","00;33;53;06","00;34;19;01","And I'm just thinking about Kristian Erickson, you know, the soccer player. Then if you heard he collapsed during the euro's and his heart stopped and all the team were around him trying to and then they had to play the game in about an hour's time. Now, their ability to perform was going to be very hard. It's not a performance coaching question at that point."
"Speaker 3","00;34;19;01","00;34;36;08","There's these other dynamics going on and I think that this this ability for active influence to at least unify how regimes can change and how it could be the environment, the system, the the emotions, all these things are quite."
"Speaker 1","00;34;37;13","00;34;41;19","Quite useful thanks, Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;34;43;00","00;35;12;28","Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate what you're saying there, Steve. I am aside from that, from the step by step part that I think the caudate nucleus tends to to perform when we're when we're trying to climb that little mountain there robotically. It's another factor, I think that's kind of interesting. And that's if it's embodied in its skill, there's probably three kinds of math at play."
"Speaker 2","00;35;12;28","00;35;44;08","There's the materialization, the how sort of the engineering of it. There's the what's in, what's out, what's superfluous and what what needs to be an element within the performance. And then I think what this paper does in the interaction is pieces. It brings the, the probably into the conversation. And I think you need all three kinds of, of calculations in order to be able to get a real grip on, on what's going on."
"Speaker 2","00;35;44;08","00;36;07;26","Maybe not an optimal grip, at least a fuzzy grip on what to do next. I think if you only have two of those elements, you've got the perfect conditions for an instrumentalist approach. When you add the probably whether it's Erickson what did he text or email all of his his teammates and said, go finish the game, we got it, we got to finish this game."
"Speaker 2","00;36;08;05","00;36;29;01","And I think Stephen's right. You can you can give it an instruction to your teammates and say, I'm fine, but you just had a cardiac arrest and we probably aren't going to be able to wipe that from our memory. In that moment. And so it's a little bit more complicated when we add probably. But I think we need probably in order for it to be interactions."
"Speaker 1","00;36;31;02","00;36;54;23","So that team like in the middle of the game, the personnel of the team changed in the individual story. Of motor control. It's like, but that's not between you and the soccer ball. So why should it change performance? But when we have the deep generative model of the individual that includes affect, that's one way to get to the loss of a teammate influencing performance."
"Speaker 1","00;36;55;05","00;37;21;13","And the second way would be to actually genuinely allow teams to be skillful performers in the sense that there's a distributed cognitive process on the team just like there is in the body. And so they actually changed. And whoever steps into that person's position on the field, they're going to have a different approach. So it'd be like switching out, you know, one arm for another arm or one forager an estimate for another, an estimate."
"Speaker 1","00;37;21;23","00;37;39;26","It's going to change the emergent properties of the group in a way that's an explanation at the group level rather than requiring to come back to just the optimal motor control, value driven instruction, guided of a Body Blue Yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;37;39;27","00;38;00;29","Just the probably is like what gives active inference? It's power, right? Like probably if I don't eat breakfast, I'm going to collapse in the middle of a field, you know, or playing a game or whatever. So so when you have that, that probably it allows you to guide all of your actions toward a given intention, I think."
"Speaker 1","00;38;02;10","00;38;03;11","Thanks, Blue Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;38;04;12","00;38;33;15","Yeah. And I also think when probably because probably is often is still in that value my world, you know probably I will get this gain or that gain when the word uncertainty is put in uncertainty is a much scarier word. Than probability because it's like it has that risk component. That's really interesting that you say that that that we tend to say probably everything will be OK, but out of importance is like you don't know."
"Speaker 3","00;38;34;28","00;38;37;02","It's all it's all unknown to some extent."
"Speaker 1","00;38;38;28","00;39;09;08","Here's here's another nice piece from the paper that I think can continue this discussion about probability and maybe also how active inference reframes it. So the physics of flow embedded in active inference. Now it's an ongoing discussion. Exactly. The Formalisms that get us to a physics of information flow on sense cognition in action. So other live streams, other days, other years but let's just roll with this physics of flow."
"Speaker 1","00;39;10;12","00;39;38;11","It's accounting for sensory motor behavior to show that motion in a biologically realistic state space. Irreducibly includes two orthogonal kinds of motion, the irritation and the solenoid or component. So that's what we are looking at here. Just this is a paragraph that's representing this piece instead of just value only we have value and flow. And again, this is key to reiterate because it's something that isn't included in reward scalar representations."
"Speaker 1","00;39;39;11","00;40;09;01","So the former that the first one, the curl free, is what allows the flow to climb a gradient towards more valuable or probable states. Now that's one of the head scratchers and active inference that preferred states are likely states under an optimistic deep generative model. And that is the alignment that allows us to reduce uncertainty and by way of reducing uncertainty achieve our target outcomes."
"Speaker 1","00;40;09;25","00;40;35;09","And so when we align the deep generative model in an optimistic way such that we believe that likely states are preferred ones, that it's likely that tomorrow I'll have a regular body temperature, it's likely that tomorrow I'll be in this preferred body position, then we actually get to pursue value as a consequence of reducing uncertainty. There's more to say on this."
"Speaker 1","00;40;35;09","00;40;37;01","But Dean, go for it. And then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;40;38;04","00;41;11;01","Yeah, and I think, Daniel, that what that points out is that there's a dependency for people who want to introduce statistical propositions to what's the underlying situation that we're observing. There's a dependency on the derivative math and the accounting math. You can't you can't figure out what probably is without figuring out how and what and having a having a a sense of confidence around what, how and what are."
"Speaker 2","00;41;11;17","00;41;37;26","So I don't think it's it isn't just the introduction. The fact of the inference, active inference is also wholly dependent on a strong foundation in terms of really being able to get from priors through that hidden state. And how do we do that? We have to have derivatives and we have to have accounts so I think there's a real codependency."
"Speaker 2","00;41;37;26","00;41;43;17","Back to the between comment that Stephen brought up Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;41;43;26","00;41;44;19","Thanks, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;41;47;09","00;42;25;24","Yeah, that that that idea of things going through cycles, I think I'm not going to go into this again, but, you know, it often comes up is that's from what I'm understanding is is pretty much not present in optimal motor control theory because it's it's about you go there and then now you have a vector and that vector is a thing and that thing gets optimized but you never have that thing I think like the messiness that kind of in between and you're kind of holding that in between both."
"Speaker 3","00;42;25;24","00;42;50;12","But that only makes sense if you keep revisiting the in-between. Like if the you need to have earlier decisions, whatever. I mean, that's an open question again for another day. But the some way that you're revisiting this understanding because otherwise you've got no way to make any sort of information gains or information extraction unless you have a revisiting to compare."
"Speaker 1","00;42;52;13","00;43;20;19","Interesting and it's one of the key pieces, again, that we reduce our uncertainty and achieve preferred states through that process. I'm just imagining, you know, something from organic chemistry. It's like you want to study up, cram for your final and OK, you want to pass. So are you going to take a reinforcement learning perspective or an active inference perspective?"
"Speaker 1","00;43;20;28","00;43;41;21","Well, the reinforcement learning perspective is like saying you'll get the big reward when you pass. So what's the most rewarding problem that we should be solving or what's the most rewarding chapter to review? But you don't know because if you knew then you'd pass. OK, so you're kind of right back at square zero with value because you framed learning as a value question."
"Speaker 1","00;43;42;13","00;44;09;15","In contrast, the active inference learner would be like, Oh sure, my preference is to pass. How am I going to reduce my uncertainty about the critical path of passing? Well, let's I haven't even open the textbook. Let's go to the first table of contents or something like that. Like reduction of uncertainty gives a first step and then it even allows for, OK, maybe that wasn't even the right first step, or maybe that was a good two step path."
"Speaker 1","00;44;09;15","00;44;54;06","And now I'm ready to go a different way, but I'm trying to reduce my uncertainty about how to get to what I prefer, which is passing rather than I've Apriori valued this future state, and now I'm going to back propagate value at every single step of the line, and then I'm going to stress myself out. If this specific chapter isn't maximal, rewarding because everything again has to get reduced to value in this value is everything framework but in the uncertainty reduction framework, we see sort of this mist of uncertainty and then regularities and especially dependable ones emerge out of that."
"Speaker 1","00;44;54;19","00;45;28;11","And so we're planning amidst uncertainty with preferences in mind, trying to figure out what to do. That's planning as inference amidst uncertainty, which is just a world apart from planning to maximize value through time given, you know, what model again of how value is assigned. It's just a recursive question. And value learning doesn't give us that higher level answer for how we should actually go about planning to obtain values, let alone critiquing value as a pervasive framework."
"Speaker 3","00;45;28;16","00;45;52;19","Stephen Well, actually that's a very interesting talking about organic chemistry experiences at university that I had an absolute nightmare on my organic chemistry I mean, I give my textbook to someone I got behind on the organic side and it was this like two inch thick textbook on organic chemistry. And every time you go into it's got so many words, it's long names."
"Speaker 3","00;45;52;19","00;46;22;14","And all this is going on is really interesting because we had this class with a new professor and he got there and he got a few people to go up to the board and it became clear that absolutely no one knew the organic chemistry and no one had seemed to pick up on this. So we are now in the second year, no one knew they were doing, I think was even the third year and he said and he said, you recommended a little thin exercise book with exercises, not on all the different chemical reactions and all the structure and it just the key reactions."
"Speaker 3","00;46;22;14","00;46;51;11","And just to go through these exercises in this thin book. And basically that got me through the exam and got me on track. No and you know, so going for the big book and the the memorizing and the optimal control, it was just work out the five key types of reaction and do the exercises. And I think that speaks to what you were talking about there, you know, which ways the electrons move and that suddenly really, really changed everything."
"Speaker 1","00;46;54;14","00;47;26;04","There's also some fun drilling happening, of course, all around me. Welcome back, Dave. So this section right here, it's it's a nice challenge. It increases the difficulty of speaking, but it's fun. This is a challenge for other frameworks. This idea that the two flows together provide a richer framework for expressing skill, fullness as a process whose characteristic go beyond a simple gradient of value accuracy."
"Speaker 1","00;47;26;11","00;47;49;25","So we saw that reward is enough paper recently. And some participants at our lab are kind of curious about writing a response because that's the whole argument is they said, hey, reward is enough, the kernel can be reward. And that's how you get all of these intelligent behaviors provided that you have these second level tweaks on the model or these bolted on modules."
"Speaker 1","00;47;50;12","00;48;30;15","And then the contention of the authors here is that value functions and indeed any motor scheme based upon functions that return scalars are not up to the task of modeling the variety of skillful acts describing human behavior, any kind of behavior just human, because by construction they cannot account for the solenoid or aspect of flow. So that's pretty interesting that when we have to bottleneck into a single number, we lose a lot of the expressive ity that allows for explore and exploit behavior to almost coexist because we're collapsing onto a number line."
"Speaker 1","00;48;30;27","00;48;50;09","So there's extremely limited availability for, you know, what do you want for your main dish and your side dish? And you just say seven, you can't express two things with just one number, but if you could say, you know, seven and three, you could express something that's more in a two dimensional space."
"Speaker 4","00;48;50;16","00;49;13;17","Blue so I think you bring up an interesting point about any behavior or just human behavior. And I think about, you know, there's like dolphins that use tools, right, to crack open like fish and or to crack open not the fish, but the the sea urchins, right? So there's dolphins that use tools for eating and then there's dolphins that don't."
"Speaker 4","00;49;13;26","00;49;39;17","And so is there. And like this is like a hereditary like it's an example of cultural evolution in dolphins, actually. So it's, you know, it's hereditary, but only because it's passed on through learning and social learning. Right? So you bring up and then we saw the motor plant, right? Like the motorized plants, like does the plant learn where the like how like skillful performance?"
"Speaker 4","00;49;39;17","00;50;06;12","I mean, this is a skill for performance on the part of the plant. So it's a really interesting question whether, you know, I mean, we think about active inference as applying to all non equilibrium steady state systems, but does this maybe apply only in the human sense of movement, movement or what about like tribes of humans? Like what about like in a nomadic kind of population with the supply there also cool."
"Speaker 1","00;50;07;12","00;50;38;12","Here's another nice piece in this section that I think will be useful for us to learn about. So technically, it's easier to read when it's already been written. When you're getting the drilling experience, that's when it's the hardest to skillfully improvise. But reading is a little easier. Technically, active inference extends popular predictive coding models used in neuroscience, where perception is critical only perception is cast in terms of prediction error minimization."
"Speaker 1","00;50;38;19","00;51;03;17","So that's the classic rule in Ballard. 99 paper. That's sort of a mega citation and there's a huge amount of subsequent work. And predictive processing or predictive coding is just looking at the relationship from sense to updating of the generative model of sense. So it's a signal processing framework. And this is something I know that Dave is a big fan of us."
"Speaker 1","00;51;03;17","00;51;41;20","You know, it's drills and hammers. And I know that Dave is a fan of talking about the signal processing and the audio processing roots of active inference. So this is just on the inbound just from sensory information to estimates of that generative model of that generative process of the sensory data. The active inference framework extends this account of predictive processing to model motor control and explains action selection by appealing to the minimization of divergence between predicted sensory data and actual sensory data."
"Speaker 1","00;51;42;07","00;52;09;17","So each year we have the exact same divergence minimization. It will sound better on the live stream. My Jesse colleagues, don't worry, it's the same divergence that's being minimized, which is the difference between observed and expected sensory data. So in predictive processing, it's about sense and perceiving sense. And so you want to minimize the divergence between what sensory data you expect and what you're actually getting."
"Speaker 1","00;52;10;06","00;52;31;11","But active inference has inference planning as inference into the loop and explains action selection also in terms of the exact same divergence goal of predictive processing, which is again, to have your observed sensory outcomes come into line with your expected sensory outcomes."
"Speaker 2","00;52;31;19","00;53;01;09","The yeah, I one of the things I used to share with people is so today I'm wearing my murder of of Crows t shirt because I used to study a lot of court behavior. And even though I work, there's, there's still some question as to what sort of verbal cues there, what instructions corporates are able to share because they are social animals."
"Speaker 2","00;53;01;09","00;53;32;18","And there they are problem solvers, but you don't have one Corbett standing to the side as another of solves a problem giving them instructions so I think it's kind of interesting when we're when we're looking at this behavior question whether we're the only species that are actively inferring because they think that there are other species out there that you can make a case that they are doing that probably form of questioning and answering as well."
"Speaker 2","00;53;33;21","00;54;12;05","So yeah, it can be tools, it can be based on on on social constructs it can be based on caching. So deep memory. And again, there's a dependency, I think for behavior that uses active inference to also have some grounding in how and what. So I don't think that active inference in and of itself will allow us to, to minimize anything unless we have the derivative and the accounts."
"Speaker 2","00;54;12;16","00;54;28;10","So I think it's I think it's it's a virtuous triad here. But I think what this paper is trying to do is get away from the idea that all problems can be solved with only two kinds math cool."
"Speaker 1","00;54;28;10","00;54;29;11","Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;54;32;03","00;55;15;09","Yeah. Further to that point arounds, you know, what humans do or animals do in general is you could say optimal control approaches, maybe it's only really humans that can apply that extra level on top as this kind of constraining kind of deductive idea. And every every other organism is really working with this kind of flow. I mean, if you see a squirrel trying to run up a tree and between trees and chase another school around the trees, it's quite phenomenal just how agile they are and the speed they can work at and so there's some sort of skillful performance that they've got."
"Speaker 3","00;55;15;25","00;55;49;06","So there's this interest in thing whereby you've got this. We see optimal control as more straightforward, but it basically it's almost really optimal control just isn't implementable in practical terms. It's almost it's a it's a what you could say is non ergodic deductive extra that humans bring to the table to explain the mechanical world that they're bringing to bear in some way."
"Speaker 3","00;55;49;07","00;55;54;22","So it's kind of interesting just happens to be that was the first explanation we had for this type of stuff."
"Speaker 1","00;55;56;05","00;56;23;28","Nice. So let's think about what active inference is and then see who might be doing it or what might be doing it. So again, the core idea is that rather than selecting commands the organism in active inference is inferring what it must or should be doing under this same imperative of predictive coding, which is to minimize the relationship, minimize the divergence between observed and expected outcomes through time."
"Speaker 1","00;56;24;20","00;57;00;22","Crucially, this brings perception and action together in the same functional profile. We have them on a current sort of treating market, almost like we can reduce our uncertainty through updating our model and we reduce our uncertainty through action. So updating an action or action and inference are put on common footing. And it also explains some. So this is the sort of computational list or algorithmic level is we're making a sensory motor model that doesn't just have arrows connecting pieces ad hoc and say, look, they're connected because I drew a picture."
"Speaker 1","00;57;01;03","00;57;24;25","We're bringing perception and action together in a common modeling framework. And also on the neurological, it explains some of the similarities between the functions of sensory and motor cortices. So that speaks to Dean's points earlier and to a lot of these brain regions that might have been discovered or initially characterized as having a more cognitive or a more motor role."
"Speaker 1","00;57;24;25","00;57;48;02","But then it's shown that they play other roles and so, you know, cue the endless clickbait. Oh, this brain region associated with this also does that should that be surprising? Should that be salient or should we have another view where that is to be expected? Now, while this move from a problem of control, so off to motor control, that's the action side."
"Speaker 1","00;57;48;13","00;58;14;21","And then there's so pure action side, optimal motor control tends to not concern itself too much with uncertainty of measurement or deep generative models. And then you have the pure sensory processing side that's kind of predictive processing. This move from a problem of control to one, an inference in terms of active inference. Does not make the problem mathematically easier in and of itself, but it offers a different model of skilled action which respects the neurophysiological evidence."
"Speaker 1","00;58;15;11","00;58;57;09","So in other words, we're taking the sort of problem of going from sense data to a generative model, the predictive processing model, and then the forward model from internal states to action selection. And it's easier to, of course, subset to just one of those directions and say that one has a tractable model. But active inference is combining both directions or integrating across these two different ways of looking at sense in action and saying Let's have one model of sense in action with a common functional profile as they describe it here."
"Speaker 1","00;58;57;27","00;59;34;04","Now, which systems have it? Do it? That's the realism question and the instrumental ISM question is which systems can we model as if they're doing this? So I think that the instrumental ISM question, which as always, it's about us, so it's easier to answer is the kinds of systems that have sensory motor input output dynamics. So everything from a self-driving car to different kinds of animals, we could model as if they were getting input, generative model output."
"Speaker 1","00;59;34;07","00;59;59;15","So the things that people model with OJ or that that classical sandwich of cognition, those are the kinds of systems that are apt to be models with active inference the kinds of things that people were modeling with optimal control going from the model to action and the kinds of systems that people were modeling with predictive processing from sensory inputs to generative model."
"Speaker 1","01;00;00;10","01;00;07;12","Both of those and ones that especially are doing both, those are some of the most amenable systems for active inference."
"Speaker 3","01;00;07;22","01;00;31;10","Even you. I was wondering this this idea of functional profile is I haven't heard that one before. Might be another one to think on the ontology that's been talked about how have you seen that being used anywhere else in terms of active inference, functional profile good question."
"Speaker 1","01;00;31;27","01;00;59;09","It doesn't seem like it's used anywhere else in this paper. And I don't off hand recall what other papers it might have been used in. But that's a great point. And I mean, to ask about, I think the notion of just function is a key one to follow and what what how how do we follow function? Yeah, go ahead."
"Speaker 1","01;00;59;09","01;00;59;15","See."
"Speaker 3","01;01;00;17","01;01;38;24","Yeah, I suppose because this is talking about actions, skillful performance function starts to it's thinking about the functional ways in how to achieve an action of skill for performance. So maybe that's how it comes in here. Whereas a lot of some of the other papers, there's no moving parts, so to speak. It's all information based, you know, in terms of but I think it's, it's interesting in terms of what that does or what it's trying to do is another way of trying to speak to something which is a bit bigger."
"Speaker 3","01;01;39;27","01;02;03;07","You know, that's one thing I've noticed is that inference normally things are trying to define what everything is this one, it gives these gives these pullbacks the like, OK, we've got a functional profile now that allows us to do X, Y, Z. But like I say, it does provide that challenge of trying to fit that into these other pullbacks that we've seen."
"Speaker 3","01;02;03;07","01;02;32;20","So we keep finding that peer in like in the effective charge that came up in one. And so, yeah, I think that's a kind of an interesting question about how that fits in with other types of models or ways of translating between spaces or frameworks and then."
"Speaker 1","01;02;32;24","01;02;33;07","Thanks."
"Speaker 2","01;02;34;09","01;03;04;03","Yeah. So I wonder, so let's just take that to its, its next logical place. So let's start with a functional profile, not necessarily work back, but is there some way for us to be able to identify what's in that profile that would allow for active inference? And should we is that something that that is that dangerous or is that legitimate Nice question."
"Speaker 1","01;03;06;14","01;03;44;05","There's a little bit where they're getting at this realism and instrumental ism discussion. So even some of the most forthright defenders of the Active Inference Framework Assemble have backed away from making such strongly realist claims about the costly, efficacious character of generative model. So here is where we see hardcore realism. So it's nice, you know, and as we work towards the terms and the ontology, how can we classify the different senses or uses of terms first in 2013 has advanced the view that an agent does not have a model of its world."
"Speaker 1","01;03;44;05","01;04;11;11","It is a model now that's an interesting claim, but the authors bring this up by also qualifying, for instance, use of model from a different paper and saying crucially, if we accept the generative models of the active inference frameworks, not sure if this is if they're saying usually it's framework, but will there be multiple active inference frameworks in line with these proposals?"
"Speaker 1","01;04;11;11","01;04;24;29","We must embrace the idea that generative models are causal in the sense of an agent's inactive attunement with the world rather than part of the causal efficacious machinery used by an agent. So that's an interesting claim."
"Speaker 4","01;04;25;03","01;04;47;26","Blue So I was thinking about like, you know, that an agent doesn't have a model of the world, but it is a model. And like I think about that in terms of people that are that get have traumatic brain injury and then have like dramatic amnesia, like can't remember how to walk or talk or eat and have to like relearn all of these things."
"Speaker 4","01;04;47;26","01;05;11;28","Right? So, so I think about like if we don't I mean, in that case, it seems like the model like you have a model and then you suddenly don't have a model. But it's like if you are a model, are you suddenly not a model or is your is that like a temporal disruption I don't know. Like so that that to me, I mean and this is instrumentalist realist debate, I realize."
"Speaker 4","01;05;12;07","01;05;21;07","But where do you you know, if you are a model, is that like a temporal disruption and suddenly you have to start over? Or what does that look like in those circumstances?"
"Speaker 1","01;05;22;02","01;05;23;07","Nice question, Steven."
"Speaker 3","01;05;25;14","01;06;03;18","Yeah, I mean, in a way, I suppose when someone has to rely on the fact that they are at some level their body is part of being that model that gives them access to either some fires or they call it the morphological computing capacity, the body's capacity to then form those priors because you know, if if however, certain parts of the body are like with a stroke, that can be kind of challenging because that maybe the actual way the body moves is compromised."
"Speaker 3","01;06;03;18","01;06;16;08","Therefore, the ability to use it to recreate is is diminished. I mean, the question of how much it's diminished then becomes I don't know if anyone could quantify that, but it's interesting."
"Speaker 1","01;06;17;03","01;06;36;27","It's a good point. It instrumentalist would say well, you know, the brain isn't, you know, per se doing active inference. We're going to model it as such. But then when there is an injury to the physical system, then we say, oh, we're still just modeling it with active inference. We're just changing our active inference model. Or has the actual system itself changed?"
"Speaker 1","01;06;37;13","01;07;01;16","So will we just always say that even when the system changes in the physical world, we're just going to update our model and just always stay in the instrumentalist and land? Or are there times where changes in the world make the instrumental ism verge into realism as if it's actually describing something about the world that's going to be a very delicate walk."
"Speaker 1","01;07;03;15","01;07;26;28","And they they are arguing that again, if we think about these generative models as purely formal and epistemic tools. So just like a linear regression, you know, you can do a linear regression on GDP or on some other feature. You can do a T test in a double blind study. It doesn't make the people a T test. It doesn't make the GDP a linear model."
"Speaker 1","01;07;27;05","01;07;54;00","So it doesn't make something active inference just to use it in this statistical framework. That's what's meant by the formal and epistemic tools. Then this framework is, we argue, compatible with a sensory motor approach to understanding skilled action. It's interesting to me because the sensory motor approach to understanding skilled action itself could have a realist or an interpreter or an instrumentalist approach."
"Speaker 1","01;07;54;09","01;08;36;04","The instrumentalist sensory motor would say, I'm not even saying the system has sense in action. I'm just saying we could model it as if it had sense in action, whereas the realism of sensory motor would say, this system actually does have sensory and active components and also this is another important note. The sensory motor view reflects a spectrum of ideas, which includes simple open loop sensory motor correlations, closed loop systems, regularities given a goal, and optimal sets of regularities according to a certain performance metrics."
"Speaker 1","01;08;36;22","01;09;02;12","These can be understood using the tools of dynamical models of cognition, capturing the brain, body environment, interactions in terms of dynamical systems, as opposed to assuming the agent is involved in symbolic computation. So it's almost like we see a lot of separation of the isolation of agency or the delineation of agents with agents in the niche and the niche itself."
"Speaker 1","01;09;02;12","01;09;43;07","So we see like agent and external internal states and external states. And now when we think about brain and body, that's one sort of inseparable dyad, and then it is also inseparable from the niche. So how are we going to take all these dynamical systems which have different physical and causal connections among them brain, body and niche and work towards a framework that's actually going to say what we want to say and be useful for what we want to do with these kinds of models, like reducing uncertainty about how organisms will act or designing environments that work for different sorts of agents."
"Speaker 1","01;09;44;04","01;10;01;15","How are we going to do that effectively? And drawing from what we know about dynamical systems more broadly, rather than bring on assumptions such as that, the agent is performing symbolic computation, which comes along with the constructionism and the representation ism and all these other pieces."
"Speaker 3","01;10;01;19","01;10;42;05","Stephen you know, this is a useful sentence here to show that dynamic that's happening between the kind of participatory sense making world and the sort of in activists and the inactive inference world because there's there's these useful distinctions that have been coming up in an activism and this participatory sense making, yet they struggle to give the ways to actually calculate how that comes about outside of these kind of metrics that are looking from the outside of the system."
"Speaker 3","01;10;42;09","01;11;03;28","So this this is kind of quite a dance that's going on, but it seems to be yielding some good progress facts of inference because they're laying some of the grounds for active inference to then see what could be plausibly modeled so that's quite useful."
"Speaker 1","01;11;04;20","01;11;46;16","Yeah. Another point to that and also what you said earlier they're suggesting that active inference is going to extend costly linear accounts of motor control, which tend to focus on the contingency between new actions and their consequences. So the loop there, which is hardly a loop, it's actually a line goes from action selection to a new state like I want, you know, I want to grasp the coffee cup, how am I going to grasp I grasped that is the domain of many previous models which is like from some sort of delta that needs to be accomplished to achieving that action."
"Speaker 1","01;11;46;16","01;12;17;18","And that's where the model ends. Active inference, in fact, proposes a complimentary view where predictions of expected proprioceptive states are not just seen as passive reactions to new motor signals like in the Coffee Cup Drive example, but as also triggering adjustable dynamic reflex arcs to generate new actions. So here instead of starting from action to a new proprioceptive state, like I want to be in a different state, so I want to select an action."
"Speaker 1","01;12;17;18","01;13;11;24","OK, now my elbow is in the correct predicted Proprioceptive State, so we're good to go here. We're starting with the updating of our Proprioceptive State moving to action selection, inferring our state. So action and inference like the two stroke engine are now working together in a way where we can pull out a little local stretch that has the same functional features as this linear causative model above, because there's going to be some stretch where that action was performed and where the functional characteristics were carried out but we're embedding that in a deep temporal model, and the temporal depth of this model confers a more active anticipatory role to proprioception now seen in a constantly circular"
"Speaker 1","01;13;11;24","01;13;47;08","model in line with the inactive and embodied approach. So that's that sort of rummaging around that gives an anticipatory and active role for proprioception, not just a state estimate role for proprioception so that it can get relayed to the central headquarters, transmuted and sent back as an instruction. It's not like a central intelligence model of action selection. It's like an anticipatory deep temporal model that allows sense to be doing something slightly different Stephen."
"Speaker 3","01;13;50;05","01;14;24;04","Just a question when it says and so it says new actions, a new action in active inference is the new well guess I suppose, of what the action state is. And then the new Proprioceptive State. This is interesting thing. We proprioception is is that almost a guess as well like based on a mix of sort of introspective data and other data or data about other ways?"
"Speaker 3","01;14;24;10","01;14;39;23","So is it like a a different types of gas in or is one of them action one's still been seen this perception in that loop good question."
"Speaker 1","01;14;39;23","01;15;04;10","I'm sure there's a lot of ways to go about it. But one thought is even perception is inference that's predictive coding. So our visual perception is clearly a generated inference. There's no blind spot. There's resolution in color in the periphery where we know the anatomy of the eye doesn't directly support that and so on. There's smoothness even though our eyes are constantly secreting."
"Speaker 1","01;15;04;27","01;15;57;17","So whether it's appropriate scepter or whether it's visual input that is also inferred as part of the deep generative model. And so when there is ambiguous visual input or ambiguous proprioceptive input, for example, that inactive inference is an opportunity for uncertainty reduction. Rather than getting out over our skis, we then saying whether that's a valuable or an E or a less valuable state we actually don't need to judge the value in a scalar framework of ambiguous versus unambiguous states because we can just pursue uncertainty, reduction, and then also cast planning as inference and perception as inference does that make sense even then?"
"Speaker 3","01;15;57;29","01;16;33;10","Yeah, that's that's really useful. And I think like what you're saying there, that also brings in the, the idea of temporal scale. So there's with vision and with this, there's what's going on below greater speeds and flux than we can know. Like the scales and the way those records then get put together to be this kind of joined up smooth perception of vision and this this is this new action, new Proprioceptive state that's almost kind of at the speed of everyday awareness."
"Speaker 3","01;16;33;28","01;17;05;23","And once things become longer and happen over the period of like 10 minutes intervals, you can no longer track that in your work in memory or your work in phenomenological consciousness. So this is kind of like the Goldilocks zone in a way where we're able to when it's talking about act, new action, new proprioceptive states, it's kind of sits in that kind of an averaged out perceptual awareness in a way that we can engage."
"Speaker 1","01;17;07;10","01;17;09;01","Interesting point blue."
"Speaker 4","01;17;10;23","01;17;31;00","Yeah. Then you already like kind of said I was going to say right after Stephen but proprioception really is is the expectation like where do I expect my body to be where like instead of asking like where is my leg? It's like, where is my leg supposed to be? Or Where do I think my leg actually is? And you're not always right."
"Speaker 4","01;17;31;00","01;18;00;06","Right. Like in the phantom limb case and even like, you know, if you're stuck with a pin, right? Like so and this is not appropriate reception, this is just generally like where your nerves are. So some in some places they're very close together. And you can infer with great accuracy where exactly the pin was poked into you. But in some other places in your body, the nerves are more far apart and so you can't tell even if the nerve even if two pins, you put a pin here, you poke a pin here, you touch the same place."
"Speaker 4","01;18;00;06","01;18;08;06","It's like the pin is here, but you're not always right. So so there's there's this inference that that happens in proprioception as well."
"Speaker 1","01;18;09;17","01;18;34;04","Nice. It's like there's one mode where you have a very high confidence prior of where your arm is located. You know, it's right by my side, let's just say. And when there's a high confidence prior data that don't support that prior are only going to move it slightly. If someone's very convinced that something is the case, they say it's 100% the case, that this is this way."
"Speaker 1","01;18;34;04","01;19;05;23","Well, then, you know, there's no point in providing alternative evidence because they're going to see it in terms of their prior. So in that case of the phantom limb, it's like there's a high precision prior that the limb is in a certain location. In fact, it's such a strong prior that sensory data like proprioceptive data that your arms in a different place or visual data that, for example, somebody no longer has that limb still doesn't manage to update the experience or the generative model of the limb being there."
"Speaker 1","01;19;05;24","01;19;35;12","So that's one case that we can frame in an active inference way. And another case would be like where's my leg? I have low confidence. And now instead of framing this just as a estimate that there's an uncertainty on, and then we're going to have to tag a value on we go from that estimate with uncertainty to planning as inference, what motor control or what motor behavior is going to reduce uncertainty on the leg."
"Speaker 1","01;19;35;27","01;19;56;23","And sometimes that's like looking at it, other times it but that's a motor behavior with the eyes. Other times it might be doing a motion that then like kind of gives us some sensor data. So it's kind of like checking your phone and seeing like what notifications are there when you're uncertain. Maybe sometimes like a shake or something like that."
"Speaker 1","01;19;56;23","01;20;25;17","It's like just reactivating a bunch of sensors just to pass say, Oh, yep, we're here just checking in, reducing your uncertainty. And so the state estimate, even when there is uncertainty about it, we can reduce that uncertainty through action selection rather than just being trapped in a framework of like, OK, I'm not sure where it is and now I'm not sure whether that's rewarding or not, and now I'm not sure which path to take that's going to be most rewarding."
"Speaker 1","01;20;26;29","01;20;58;01","We don't go down the reward rabbit hole because there's a deep generative model and for evolved slash created or whatever organisms those priors are fit. So it's not just like we're dealing with the space of all possible generative models. These have been evolutionarily selected to be functional in our physical constraints, but underwater or in a different gravity space."
"Speaker 1","01;20;58;01","01;21;29;17","It'd be a different set of priors that would need to be learned or utilized in our last piece here. What what do you think were some of the big pieces that we leave this 23 strange attractor with as we move forward? Like what kinds of distinctions or insights here do we want to see how they apply in different settings."
"Speaker 1","01;21;29;24","01;21;31;09","Dean and then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;21;33;26","01;21;59;20","OK so this is going to me a strange twist but that's that's OK. So I came away from the paper and I thought about some of the things that Casper did bring up. Casper did bring up in terms of so so what happens when when we talk to instruction, it's like instructors are all around us. There's people that spend a great deal of their life preparing to become an instructor."
"Speaker 2","01;22;00;07","01;22;23;14","And we come along and say, Yeah, that's great, we know what you do, but we're going to kind of, I don't know, maybe bring you down a peg because we've been introduced this other stuff that you weren't asked to sort of train yourself up on. And I'm not sure if that's a threat or not. And I guess it depends on the person now that I hear the ideas introduced to."
"Speaker 2","01;22;23;15","01;22;58;19","But I'll bring a bring a if you know, the movie is Independence Day and Thelma and Louise, I'm going to bring those into and kind of into a juxtaposition here. I think for the instrumentalists they don't necessarily see that there can be for the person who is living out the adversarial Greek myth that's against the aliens or that's against the the people who are chasing us down and trying to get our our convertible back there, isn't it?"
"Speaker 2","01;22;58;26","01;23;53;15","There is no set of instructions per say that those people want to follow. They're living the interaction is state and you could start out with kick the tires and light the fires all Harry Connick Jr. And still end up in a rapid deceleration moment ala susan sarandon and geena davis. And I think for people who are going to look at this problem in terms of how do we introduce this interaction ism in a way that doesn't threaten the top down hardness of how most most situations where we want people to be able to take up as an embodied skill, skillful performance without putting them in a situation where they behave like aliens or behave like"
"Speaker 2","01;23;53;29","01;24;22;17","police, chasing somebody down with a helicopter we're going to have to sort of I don't know I don't know if it's a slow rolling. I'm not sure exactly what it is. But those people who are now currently instructors and instructional lists by by profession, we're going to have to give them something so that they don't cling desperately to a model that I think the authors of this paper demonstrate."
"Speaker 2","01;24;22;21","01;24;49;25","It requires a rethink. I don't think we throw out instructional ism but I absolutely do think that it's it's place on the top of the mountain. And now all these little robots climbing up it, that that has to be reviewed and revisited. And so, I mean, as a go forward, I don't know how we put people in a place where they're comfortable with that kind of I don't want to say it's disruptive, but I think it is."
"Speaker 2","01;24;50;11","01;25;05;11","But I think we have to be able to come at this in a way that doesn't make them sort of circle the wagons solenoid annoyingly and try to protect something that obviously is is up for a bit of evolution before a revolution."
"Speaker 1","01;25;07;01","01;25;09;14","Nice points there, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","01;25;11;13","01;25;46;13","Yeah, I like that idea. Yeah. This challenge of having this mountain that we've kind of ascended and place these optimal control theories on. And maybe it's more like there's a mountain of active inference and there's a there's a little rock, a rock structure on the top, which is up to control theory, which we're able to sort of utilize on top of that, you know, but it's it's a lot more rickety and it's not the, the main game in town."
"Speaker 3","01;25;46;18","01;26;12;01","You know, the main game is our intuition, our dynamical balancing of all these different energy parameters. But we do and particularly humans have this ability to impose this extra shack of tools on the top that we now think is the main game in town."
"Speaker 1","01;26;13;13","01;26;53;19","Nice. So to Stephen's then to Dean's point, so as to which one's the mountain, which one's the mole hill, which one's the anthill here, Kristen says optimal control can be cast as active inference with three simplifications so as we increasingly clarify our understanding of these different models, we'll be able to see which models are nested within one another or are alternate framings of one another or are more overlapping than different, or what are those key distinctions or what are the variables where you can expand it to three and all of a sudden you've gone from Model A to B?"
"Speaker 1","01;26;54;02","01;27;25;01","So remains to be seen. And by him saying that optimal control is a thrice simplified act of inference along these three specific domains, it does suggest that the bigger picture might be active inference, and then you get special case optimal motor control with a value function as a derivative model within an active inference universe, even if these other models were developed first."
"Speaker 1","01;27;25;01","01;27;48;05","That's often the case that a certain model is introduced and then it's later generalized in several ways, so that in the future it's actually seen as a special case model, even though it's actually at one point. It was the only game in town, certainly for a lot of biology models. That's the case. And then, Dean, I really like this idea of like there's a job title called An Instructor."
"Speaker 1","01;27;48;13","01;28;41;15","And if somebody says I'm an instructor in, you know, organic chemistry or in tango baseball, people know what you're talking about. So how could interaction ism be so broadly participated in that? People say, I'm an interactor I'm a baseball interactor, I'm an Interactor. Maybe the job would be called that or not. So how do we, like you were saying, not kind of threaten or disrupt their modes, but give a yes and for what they're working on and maybe part of it is that the interactor, it's like reframing their interactions with their student, but just say as a cultural scaffolding of an interaction that doesn't make it a symmetric interaction."
"Speaker 1","01;28;42;05","01;29;31;08","It's culturally scaffolded moments of Bayesian model updating. And so it's like, yes, you do give instructions. That's the verbal term for what you say when you say pull or breathe or OK, slow down. You can still give instructions. We're not saying that that is not part of your toolkit, but let's more broadly look at your interactions with this dynamical system as doing what you want to do and maybe it'd be enough just to push them to that edges of the hill and just say interactions are a broader way than instructions, which you want to reduce everything you do to just barking instructions, or sometimes you lead by example."
"Speaker 1","01;29;31;19","01;30;00;22","Other times you show wordlessly you don't need to frame your interactions as instructions, recognize that you're just dynamical interacting systems. And this a lot of people are working on a framework that suggests that this is a broader way of thinking about training and might be able to help you on one hand with a high performance elements and on the other hand with accessibility and in making your work more communicable."
"Speaker 1","01;30;01;12","01;30;03;25","Not sure about that, of course, but just one way to go."
"Speaker 3","01;30;03;28","01;30;39;00","Stephen Yeah. With the idea of roles and how people look at performance in roles, this really comes back to coaching again. I mentioned that earlier is, you know, coaching came out of the need to supervise therapists and how they could be guided in their path as they were supposedly helping the people that were needy. They needed guidance. And that same idea now of coaching rather than teaching or instruct in."
"Speaker 3","01;30;39;17","01;31;14;07","And while they have their role is given the formal documents that you might need and provides in the bigger narrative and given certain tools, you know, you, you within that there's this idea of OK, what types of developmental or performance interactions can be nurtured and cultivated and I think this actually really can tie in to the kind of pragmatist social constructivist approaches that coaching is trying to work with."
"Speaker 3","01;31;14;08","01;31;35;27","As in, but it gives it a bit more it does actually give it a bit more meat without becoming too complex, which I think previously a lot of the active inference is maybe a bit too abstract. This is starting to show a bridge. There why coaching at different levels and and positive psychology more broadly can have a role."
"Speaker 1","01;31;40;24","01;31;42;15","OK, great. Thank you. Stephen Dean."
"Speaker 2","01;31;43;07","01;32;20;04","Yeah, Stephen, I appreciate exactly what you're saying. I just I think to get to a place where interaction is is no longer threatening. People have to want or appreciate that you can be a subject matter expert and a prediction matter expert. And I'm not sure I think there are maybe are some coaches who are both and I but I sort of transcended that and got into the wayfaring thing because Wayfaring imposes a prediction aspect to this."
"Speaker 2","01;32;20;17","01;32;45;15","I can't predict for you whether that running jump shot that you make. I can't be in your ear I cannot coach you to take that shot in that moment with that much time left on the clock. In fact, if I do that, I'm probably adding impediments and I'm actually being an optimal control is micromanaging you and you, whether you make it or not."
"Speaker 2","01;32;45;20","01;33;13;14","It's not about me. It's about whether the ball and the and the and the basket arrived at some sort of outcome that we both want. I think that I think that that's part of how we get people to a place where their dependency on their subject, subject matter, expertize doesn't overwhelm the fact that for these performances there is a predictive element."
"Speaker 2","01;33;14;00","01;33;42;16","And so we have to sort of give that equal billing. I don't think we have to overbill one or the other. It's back to the between. And that's a prediction matter expert. And again, I don't know if it's a role being a way fairer because you're in the boat with that other person, right? It doesn't matter whether you're the one saying, OK, well, I'm I'm getting a sense of the direction of the current right now and the other person's looking up at the stars."
"Speaker 2","01;33;42;17","01;34;14;17","You're working together. And so, yeah, everybody brings their expertize. And I think that that only that only materializes if we can if we can include something with the subject matter. Expertize culturally, yes, absolutely. There's a huge cultural piece to it. But I think I think you can be a coach and not necessarily be a Wayfarer, but I think if you're a wayfarer, you have to bring a predictive element into it."
"Speaker 2","01;34;14;24","01;34;16;10","Otherwise you're not being aware."
"Speaker 1","01;34;18;11","01;34;49;19","It's interesting that having an integrated way to talk about goal and process and interaction with a niche interaction with your CO wayfarers, just like your example with a movie, you know, there's is the map app going to tell you which directions to take that's kind of on the instruction list, end verses, are you on the run? So anywhere you go, you're, you're just not following instructions."
"Speaker 1","01;34;49;19","01;34;59;12","You're just negotiating sequential interactions and reducing uncertainty in a way that isn't just looking down at the application and seeing which way to turn when."
"Speaker 2","01;35;01;19","01;35;07;12","And I'm glad you picked up on the the map going out the back and over the trunk of the car."
"Speaker 1","01;35;08;09","01;35;15;24","Yeah, exactly. Oh, you're reading it. Oh, no. Right. Cool. Well, Stephen. Yes."
"Speaker 3","01;35;16;08","01;35;24;13","It's just one question. Wayfair, is that like a particular sort of approach is like an orientation based or."
"Speaker 2","01;35;25;21","01;35;48;24","Yeah, you're on your path. And how are you fairing? How are you feeling? OK, right. It's not just wayfinding. It's not just the discovery piece, but it's so how does that make you feel being in that uncertainty space? Because again, if we're going to close loop discovery, we'll eventually loop back around a recapitulation and then. Right, we're open systems that are constantly closing these loops."
"Speaker 2","01;35;49;03","01;35;51;16","So how does that make you feel like?"
"Speaker 3","01;35;51;16","01;35;51;25","Oh, yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;35;52;19","01;36;25;25","To connect that also to John Boik and Second Order Science, as well as Bucky Fuller and Trim Tab. When we're the rudder, we need to act in an anticipatory fashion. So that's kind of like first order cybernetics. The the rudder has to turn before you hit the iceberg. You know, you got to find a path. So pathfinding and that whole notion of anticipating or control comes to the rudder and the trim tab is the little rudder on the rudder."
"Speaker 1","01;36;26;03","01;37;11;00","So it's anticipating even the anticipatory nature of planning because you have to turn that trim tab even before you turn the rudder. And so here we have instead of a sort of mechanical model with recursive levels of rudders, we actually have hierarchically nested priors. And so it's a little bit like higher and higher level priors that in one sense when you look at one iceberg and you try to tell a story by backfilling, what happens they do act in increasingly anticipatory ways, but then when it's seen as just part of the wayfinding of the ship, they're all in a cyclic feedback with each other."
"Speaker 1","01;37;11;00","01;37;40;10","And it's not like one is really upstream of another, but there are certainly pieces doing different things cool stuff. Any final thoughts or questions? I don't see any other questions from the live chat, but another interesting and surprising dot two as usual, does anyone have any final comments."
"Speaker 2","01;37;41;28","01;37;42;13","And."
"Speaker 1","01;37;45;28","01;38;18;17","Well great. We'll look forward to some awesome up coming streams. Let's just look at those really fast. Next week on the 21st, we're going to have our symposium with Carl Feresten. So if you've been helping to co-organized this event and develop the questions with us, you'll be with us live. Otherwise we're going to be recording this, not live streaming it and then providing the recordings on our YouTube channel."
"Speaker 1","01;38;19;04","01;38;57;09","And then for the second two weeks of June, we're going to be doing a more technical or statistical paper empirical evaluation of active inference in multi armed bandits. Then in early July, we're going to have a fields and living paper scale free biology, integrating evolutionary and developmental thinking. Then don't have any papers for the end of July or beginning of August, but we'll figure out what we want to do there, and then we'll be turning to some industrial engineering and some other areas."
"Speaker 1","01;38;57;09","01;39;11;25","So as always, pretty fun journey. Thanks Dean Blue, Stephen, Dave for participating live and everyone for watching live on replay. We will see you on a future stream."
