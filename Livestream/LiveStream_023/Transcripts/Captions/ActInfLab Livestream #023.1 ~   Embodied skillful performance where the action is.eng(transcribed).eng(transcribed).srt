00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,599
greetings

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,759
hello everyone thank you for joining

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
live or in replay

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,960
today it is may 27th is that true

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,160
not not even close not even close

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,960
it's june 8th

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
it's june 8th 2021 we're here in actin

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,880
flab

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,719
live stream 23.1 and we are discussing

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,600
the paper embodied skillful performance

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
where the action is

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
so welcome everyone to active lab we are

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,280
a participatory online lab that is

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,320
communicating

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,559
learning and practicing applied active

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
inference

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
you can find us at the links that are

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
here on this slide

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
this is a recorded and an archived live

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,879
stream

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,879
with all of the advantages and

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
constraints that that provides

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
please provide us with feedback so that

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,879
we can improve on our work

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
all backgrounds and perspectives are

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,080
welcome here

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
and we'll be trying to follow good

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
etiquette for live streams

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
from this short link you can access

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
the calendar of events for live streams

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
of multiple different kinds and

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,759
highlighted there with the blue arrows

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,240
are

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
today's discussion on june 8th and next

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
week's discussion that'll be on the 15th

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,479
and they're both going to be on this

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
paper embodied skillful

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
performance so we had a good time making

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,560
the dot zero and

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
learning about this and kind of opening

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,960
up what this was adjacent to

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
and now we'll look forward to continuing

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,119
the discussion and just seeing where it

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,920
goes

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
for those who are watching live it would

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
be i guess

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,840
especially appreciated to throw us some

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
questions whether they're

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
related to the paper or not

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
the goal for today is to discuss

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
and learn the paper is embodied skillful

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
performance

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
where the action is by hipolito baltieri

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,560
fristen and ramstead from 2021

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,400
and today in 23.1 we'll be

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
uh ambling skillfully we hope through

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
the paper again

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
and flagging areas where we want to be

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
talking with the authors next week

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
greetings dave

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,040
welcome and just seeing

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
where we get to opening up threads and

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,319
kind of

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
enjoying the middle part of the 1.012

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,720
sandwich so we can begin with

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
the introductions and the warm-ups

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,879
today um there's a few of us so we can

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
go around in the introduction and just

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,840
give a short introduction or a check-in

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
and we can also

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
then pass somebody who hasn't spoken

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
taking a look at the warm-up questions

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
so i'm daniel i'm a postdoctoral

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,239
researcher

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,120
in california and i'll pass to dean

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
yeah hi i'm dean um i'm up here in

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
calgary um

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
and i'm getting more and more involved

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,000
with this

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
uh idea of sort of building up the

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
active inference profile i'll pass it to

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
david dave is there

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,159
but if he isn't i'll pass it back to

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
daniel

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,640
dave you're welcome to join in whenever

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
you would like

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
i hear you tapping a little bit but

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
maybe whenever you want to

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,519
speak otherwise what is the active

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,319
inference profile

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,680
that's what i think we're trying to

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
build out here i think we're trying to

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
give that some anchors and some leverage

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
so

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
we haven't figured it out completely yet

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,959
it's like

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
everything in active inference it's it's

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,519
a generative model

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,720
it's growing and i don't know what its

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
final form will be

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
or if it takes on a final form even

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
are there other areas that have profiles

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,000
or are there other

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
profiles of note

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
yeah i i think there's convention

106
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
that that's already an established

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,200
profile and i don't know that this is

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,519
has got to that place yet where it where

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,120
we can say it has

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
a convention or something that's

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
predictable about it and i think that's

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
what makes makes it kind of

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,199
uh well in my mind it makes it curious

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
where is it going as opposed to where

115
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,199
it's been and what it what it's

116
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
established so far

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
nice points agreed active inference

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
especially

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
in these nascent times it's like a

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
strange attractor

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
where people come in from so many

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,199
perspectives

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
and then they get slingshot out in a

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,479
different

125
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
direction or with a different um memory

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,400
or different

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
view so dave no worries about the

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
hardware mystery

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
everyone is welcome to just type in the

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,880
youtube chat if they have questions

131
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
so i think for the rest of this stream

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
we're going to walk through again maybe

133
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
thinking again about walking as a

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
skillful action and

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
all the fun similarities and differences

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,479
between motor

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
actions which are what are discussed

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,960
here and that sort of space where motor

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
and knowledge come together like with

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
skilled action

141
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
yes dave your your uh different

142
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,240
embodiments are muted indeed

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
so the paper uh

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
laid out their aims and claims and the

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
central aim of the paper

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
according to the authors is to discuss

147
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
critically the limitations

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,639
of instructionist control theoretic

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
models of skillful

150
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,120
performance so the big dichotomy or

151
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
dilemma that's going to come up again

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,120
and again

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
is this difference between

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
interactionism and instructionism

155
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
so maybe dean where are you

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
coming at that from or how would you

157
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
describe the difference between

158
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,960
instructionism and

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
interactionism well

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
well first of all even including

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
interactionism as a formality

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,680
i think is a huge step it's

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
metaphorically speaking it's

164
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
it's opening both of your eyes you have

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
a second eye available but

166
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,919
maybe you weren't aware of it and now

167
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,639
with with the idea of turning that into

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
sort of a

169
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,280
a structured or formalized approach as

170
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,000
opposed to

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
just the instructionalism piece

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
which is traditionally what we've

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
formalized

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
is it's not just a doubling of

175
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
of what we might be aware of it's it's

176
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
actually

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
placing ourselves where we can see the

178
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,199
depth

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
of what we're observing or what we're

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
analyzing or what we're addressing

181
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
and i think that that's that would be a

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,440
huge step if we could get people

183
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
comfortable with that

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,759
i'm not saying that people will

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
necessarily get comfortable with it

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,919
though

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
because for a lot of people let's be

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
honest um just following along and being

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
instructed is difficult enough

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
and now you're introducing a whole

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
second lens

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
of information and very quickly you'll

193
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
have a bunch of people screaming

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,319
no you're going to overwhelm them you're

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
going well i'm not

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
just because i have both my eyes open

197
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
doesn't mean that i'm going to be

198
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,120
i hope it doesn't mean i'm going to be

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
scared i hope it means that i'm going to

200
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,919
feel a little

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,960
like a little bit more grounded and

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
centered but we'll

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,039
i don't know we'll we'll have a

204
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
conversation about that today especially

205
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,599
when we include the whole body

206
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,560
yes the entire corpus one thought there

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,599
instructionism

208
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,840
being like instructions are passed from

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
a to b you know water flowing downhill

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,080
instructionism has a directional

211
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
uh context and also the idea that what's

212
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,479
being passed is the sort of packet of

213
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,840
meaning like here's the envelope with

214
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
your instructions now carry them out

215
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,319
and what i think is exciting about

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
interactionism is it's not just

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
a bi-directional instructionism it's not

218
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
like well you instruct me and then i'll

219
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,840
instruct you

220
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,879
that's sort of the the low bar for

221
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,840
interactionism but where interactionism

222
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,199
really blows the lid off

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
is when we open into that third space

224
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
of interaction and improvisation so i

225
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
think that's what's kind of

226
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
interesting to draw out and they are

227
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
going to highlight in this paper how

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,440
control theory models of skillful

229
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
performance or otherwise

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,399
implicitly or explicitly do have

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,240
instructionist assumptions

232
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,839
specifically this idea that motor

233
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,159
representations

234
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
convey or harness instructions about how

235
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
to perform a specific

236
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,880
task so even if the authors of those

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
control theory papers didn't explicitly

238
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
use the word instructionism

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
then they're still playing into this

240
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,519
idea that instructions are being passed

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
for example from the brain to the body

242
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
in order to be

243
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
carried out and we'll be looking at that

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
from a more formal perspective in a few

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
minutes

246
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
and the big claim that they're going to

247
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
be reaching is that

248
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
active inference doesn't need to posit

249
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
that instructionist assumption

250
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,160
so there's a way to frame control and

251
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
skillful performance in the active

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
inference framework

253
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
that doesn't take on these

254
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
instructionist assumptions and the

255
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
content

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,959
based directional uh message passing

257
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
that it entails and

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
that'll be something fun to explore also

259
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
dave has a nice comment in chat

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,680
dave wrote as i recall piaget and

261
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
colleagues counted and described

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
something like 400 distinct embodied

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,959
concepts

264
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,839
used by the walking skills of a typical

265
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
15 month old

266
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
so that just shows how there's a lot

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
going on even with uh

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,160
behaviors like walking cool

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,519
it's one other thing too the assumption

270
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:01,920
that

271
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
somehow uh the the

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
muscles and the nerve endings sending

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
signals that are in symbolic form

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
is quite a stretch i mean we talked

275
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
about that

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,839
last week when we got to that inverse

277
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,880
directionality slide

278
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
but i thought about that a little bit

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
after because i went back and watched

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
after last week and i was just like i

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,839
know

282
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,680
for me i was incredulous a couple a

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
couple of times we went through the

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
paper with with blue but even going back

285
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
and looking at it

286
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
you'd have to you'd have to build a

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
really

288
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,839
powerful argument that says that

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,839
the pressure signals on my fingertips

290
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
are coming back to me

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
in verbalized form

292
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
exactly it's this idea that uh you know

293
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
the files are on the computer

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
like what's coming up from the

295
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
fingertips is pain and what's going down

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
is an instruction that's sort of the um

297
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,680
cartesian dualism mapped on to

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
instructionism

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
is just like body and brain are two

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,320
disjoint pieces and they pass special

301
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
symbolic information to each other right

302
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,240
and we'll see our brain and our bodies

303
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
having a conversation

304
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
so what is it if not a conversation or

305
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
could it be beyond a conversation

306
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,920
right right nice cool

307
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,160
we covered the abstract last time

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
all we'll point out here is just that

309
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
they start as

310
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,760
good philosophers with an examination of

311
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
the instructionism

312
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,079
and what that entails the second and

313
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,440
third sections of the paper

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
are characterizing the representationism

315
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,600
representationalism that's related to

316
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,959
these motor commands kind of what we

317
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
were just alluding to

318
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
and a special focus on the optimal motor

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,000
control

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
theory and then the final sections

321
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
take it to predictive coding and to

322
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,800
active inference which are

323
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
formal frameworks for modeling behavior

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,639
that are related to

325
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
control theory formalizations but

326
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
the goal of the paper is to show that

327
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
some of the instructionism

328
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,720
is left at home which allows us to

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
go out with interactionism

330
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
here is the roadmap framing a similar

331
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
uh outline and also

332
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
just giving a few more uh

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,079
signposts along the way with the figures

334
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,439
and the box and whatnot

335
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
the keywords provided here

336
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
were helping us understand what did the

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
authors

338
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
want to have their work indexable near

339
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
in the semantic net of literature online

340
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,959
how did the authors want their work to

341
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,440
be

342
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
grounded and it was in skillful

343
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,040
performance

344
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,200
that's in the title optimal motor

345
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
control that's the sort of

346
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
um scapegoat or foil that's the contrast

347
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,279
maybe even bringing us back to

348
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,399
contrasting

349
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
divergences instructionism again

350
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
tied up with the optimal motor control

351
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,519
motor

352
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
representations lending us into

353
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
action-oriented representations and

354
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
finally

355
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
taking us to active inference where we

356
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,440
kind of

357
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
begin and end

358
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,399
so skillful performance can mean many

359
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
pieces and the authors defined it

360
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
as opposed to bear movements such as

361
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,600
breathing and blinking

362
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,920
skillful performances are intelligent

363
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,519
bodily activities

364
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
which harness knowledge about how to

365
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
perform certain movements expertly

366
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
it reminds me of the eternal debate who

367
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,040
slash what

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
is intelligent if an insect knows how to

369
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,279
walk

370
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,440
or if it is trained to do something

371
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
versus if it's something that

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,560
its body provides the training for

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
inherently what is skillful so

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,639
definitely

375
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,760
will want to ask the authors and anybody

376
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
in the chat and anybody who joins us

377
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,480
next week what is skillful performance

378
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
what is unskillful performance if

379
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
somebody tries

380
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
to do a skillful performance and fails

381
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,519
is that still

382
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
within this category of behavior

383
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,199
i saved i saved up for this week because

384
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
i wanted to get to the

385
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,199
after the comma the witch harness which

386
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,000
harness

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
knowledge uh like i kind of

388
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
hinted that that's that i wanted to ask

389
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
a question and i still do want to ask a

390
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,959
question well

391
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,000
what does that mean to harness knowledge

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
um consciously or

393
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
or is the can you get to a place i mean

394
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,199
blue talked about this you talked about

395
00:14:59,199 --> 00:14:59,680
this

396
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
can we get to a place of doing it

397
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
automatically

398
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
does that mean it's harnessed just

399
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,839
because we're not thinking about it

400
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,560
and and how much time did they spend

401
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,680
looking at that piece because

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,519
that that kind of demarcates out

403
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
what skill is is it if it's a dependent

404
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
if it's a dependency on harnessing then

405
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,040
what

406
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
how do we define that how do we define

407
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
what's what's captured and what isn't

408
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
and the harnessing brings up kind of

409
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,639
like harnessing or

410
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
yoking uh you know buffalo or a horse or

411
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
something like that

412
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,519
and that's so kind of hinging on that

413
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,320
word

414
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,519
it's like the knowledge is that wild

415
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
stallion and it's actually the bodily

416
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,880
activities which harness that knowledge

417
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
because when you quote know

418
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
that your body can move in many

419
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,399
different ways but skillful performance

420
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,560
is when that is harnessed it's when it's

421
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
connected to an instrument or whether

422
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
it's its own instrument

423
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,959
and it's channeled in a way

424
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,959
maybe that's productive or expressive

425
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,720
well at a fundamental level we have to

426
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
again be careful

427
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
that that something going on at our

428
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
fingertips is being

429
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
harnessed by something going on

430
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
three and a half feet away yes connected

431
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,040
but

432
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,240
but is that an assumption that's

433
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,800
verifiable

434
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
is there an actual harnessing going on

435
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,639
even

436
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
because lots and lots of times things

437
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
happen at my fingertips that i'm not

438
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
sending i'm not even aware of what my

439
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,199
hand is doing

440
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,320
my wife tells me stop jiggling

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,959
right just because i got nervous energy

442
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,399
or whatever

443
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
i think that's going to come back also

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
to the predictive processing

445
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
and predictive coding frameworks which

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,959
is sort of

447
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,640
when the body is getting the same the

448
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
signals it expects

449
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,720
like if you're not consciously bringing

450
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,679
your attention to

451
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
you know your foot if it's just your

452
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
foot in the shoe

453
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,919
it feels like nothing or there's no

454
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,439
attention paid to it

455
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
and you can kind of shine that light of

456
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
attention on it and it will feel

457
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
normal or maybe you can start to zoom in

458
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
on other sensations like tingling

459
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,160
or other feelings but the sort of

460
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
default state when you're not paying

461
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
attention

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,679
things that are happening the way that

463
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,559
you expect is

464
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
neutral and so that's what that's why

465
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,559
that active inference piece is really

466
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,440
interesting

467
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
because in order for it to be active

468
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,880
inferencing there has to be

469
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
some kind of attention or awareness

470
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
being paid

471
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
and that's like it's attention as um a

472
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
resource

473
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,120
gotta pay the cost of attention

474
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
or suffer suffer the regret of not

475
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
paying attention and dave

476
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
dave wrote trying and failing especially

477
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,120
if part of the problem

478
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,039
is choking which was brought up by the

479
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
authors in the paper as well

480
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
is likelier to involve more neocortical

481
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
activation

482
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
and more access consciousness than

483
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
smooth performance of the same

484
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,640
routine so trying and failing there's a

485
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
lot more

486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
inner dialogue or thought process like

487
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
awareness happening whereas when

488
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
something is performed skillfully and

489
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
smoothly

490
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
it just sort of goes off without hitch

491
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
and

492
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
just you know you whip out the

493
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,400
instrument make your your shot or your

494
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
swing or whatever it happens to be

495
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
and then maybe you can narrate in

496
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
retrospect but

497
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
in the moment you're not having as much

498
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
awareness

499
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,919
so that's something one last voice oh

500
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,559
yes

501
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
so this is really interesting to me

502
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
because again

503
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
um is it skillful to be in the peloton

504
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,640
and be

505
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
be pulled along by what we would

506
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
describe as

507
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
the intention of those in front of you

508
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
is that considered to be a part of this

509
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,360
because there's a lot of things that

510
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
we're aware

511
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
and conscious of and some things that

512
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
happen in these skilled performances

513
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,679
they're just because they're part of the

514
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,640
collective they're

515
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,039
they're caught up in the inertia of the

516
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,760
moment

517
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,520
and is how do we how do we

518
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
factor that in when we're talking about

519
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
active inference because i think

520
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
that's what instructionalism

521
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
[Music]

522
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,000
doesn't attend to there's many many

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,120
things that are going to get dragged

524
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
along here

525
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
just because they're drafting

526
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
and how do we how do we address that

527
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,960
when we're talking about

528
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,440
skill performance skillful performance

529
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
and interactionism because

530
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,919
interactionism at least says i can be

531
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,880
caught up in an

532
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
in an inertia moment i don't have to

533
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
explain it

534
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
absolutely um instructionism

535
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,080
has to pitch and hold everything into

536
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,280
that symbolic

537
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
information theory what is the

538
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
instruction from the front of the pack

539
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
of the flock of birds or the peloton of

540
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
cyclists what is the instruction that's

541
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
getting passed back

542
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
and so we have to go from what we know

543
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
is just happening which is like the

544
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,679
physical

545
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
inertia there's also a narrative inertia

546
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
there might even be just an air current

547
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,559
going over the person that actually

548
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,520
stabilizes them

549
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
in their um spot we don't need to fall

550
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,720
back

551
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
to referring to those as instructions

552
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,720
when they're clearly interacting

553
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,440
phenomena

554
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
different types of interactions you

555
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,760
could have uh somebody breathing heavily

556
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,200
next to you and that could give you a

557
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
signal but it's about the unpacking

558
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,320
of that interaction and then where that

559
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
takes the collective rather than

560
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,880
again just thinking about everything as

561
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
connected with wires and

562
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,440
passing secrets right cool

563
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,400
um we can look again at the active

564
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
infrared plant so this was just

565
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
asking where are the limits of skillful

566
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,559
performance

567
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,720
if the niche and the fitness to the

568
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
niche is what counts for different

569
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,240
organisms

570
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,039
our human cultural niche has all these

571
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,760
awesome

572
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
kinds of skillful performance and

573
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
otherwise but what about

574
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
other creatures what about other

575
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
phenomena the kinds of things that we

576
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,000
might

577
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
want to also model with active inference

578
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
but just don't

579
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,240
quite have that same level of um

580
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,039
maybe thinking through other minds as we

581
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
have with people whereas we try to put

582
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,159
ourselves in the shoes of somebody else

583
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
do you think daniel that that plant has

584
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,600
um

585
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,720
got an embodied technical

586
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,120
skill

587
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
welcome blue hey blue hi

588
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
we're just wondering whether plants have

589
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
the um

590
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,080
this plant okay but i have a technical

591
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,320
skill now that it has the

592
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
the tools to be able to move from side

593
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
to side

594
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,880
it's a great question

595
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
um

596
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,440
i wonder if if it could be shown that

597
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
it got better at moving from side to

598
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,960
side

599
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
that would start to look increasingly

600
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
skill like

601
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,480
and i think it's it's that idea that

602
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,039
it could uh the molecular changes could

603
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,240
occur that would

604
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,799
allow the plant to respond faster or you

605
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,400
could imagine selecting

606
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
on a whole greenhouse of plants and the

607
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
ones that are able to switch

608
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
faster those are going to grow faster

609
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
and then you select the ones that grow

610
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
faster based upon their ability to learn

611
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
in that generation

612
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
so it kind of shows how you get this

613
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,799
development of skill

614
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,919
within a life that's development

615
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,720
but then between generations you can

616
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
also have

617
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,559
the um entrenching or the canalizing

618
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,640
of learned skill like language

619
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,799
and skillful performance in in this

620
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,000
paper and in our

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
slides it's kind of like we're hinting a

622
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,600
lot at this full body

623
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,640
type performance uh high jump and things

624
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,440
like that

625
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
but of course language

626
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,360
is maybe one of the examples of skilled

627
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,720
performance it's a motor

628
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,520
behavior it involves a huge number of

629
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
interacting

630
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
motor subunits voice box and the mouth

631
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,520
and speech therapists and others

632
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,720
they go deep into that but

633
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
speech is almost like the case where you

634
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,919
say well surely

635
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
instructions are being passed that's

636
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
maybe the

637
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
the high water mark for where

638
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
interactionism could go

639
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,159
would be to have a speech a framing of

640
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,200
speech

641
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
that moved us beyond instructionism

642
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
because this seems like clearly the

643
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,159
transmutation of

644
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,960
semantic or symbolic information into

645
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,080
not directly related motor behavior

646
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
so that would be kind of a nice case to

647
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,520
investigate

648
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
and dave wrote in the chat it seems

649
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,799
odd that dogmas that have been known to

650
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
be false for decades are still premises

651
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,320
of so much funded professional

652
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,039
activity i'm thinking of bf skinner's

653
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,360
insistence that all control activity

654
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
must be strictly cortical

655
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
even though it's been known since at

656
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
least the 50s purely on the basis of

657
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
speed of nerve conduction that that

658
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
would prevent graceful walking

659
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,600
let alone faster and more intricate

660
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,960
movements so that's pretty

661
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
interesting we have

662
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,200
almost just anatomical reasons

663
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
to know that not everything can go

664
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
through this sort of control

665
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,600
and cognition in the loop there's just

666
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,919
not

667
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
fast enough transduction along the

668
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
nerves so there has to be this

669
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,240
sort of distributed function

670
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,919
more consistent with an interactionist

671
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,279
framework than an instructionist

672
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
framework

673
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,919
yet it's easy to fall back to

674
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,320
instructionism maybe especially for

675
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
professionalized areas

676
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,520
let's go to um optimal

677
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,360
control blue if you wanna you know feel

678
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,559
free to add anything that you'd like

679
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,080
optimal control theory is a nice bridge

680
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
point because in the paper and

681
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,679
as we'll be going into we're again

682
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,440
thinking about motor behavior

683
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,760
but control theory is something that

684
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
applies to

685
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
the electrical grid to logistics

686
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,120
to robotics which are i guess

687
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,480
motorized but optimal control theory

688
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,840
is a framework that expands to many

689
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
non-motor systems as well

690
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,600
so that makes me wonder about whether

691
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
we can also apply that instructionism

692
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
versus interactionism

693
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,240
contrast to control theoretic

694
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,279
situations that

695
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
are implicitly instructionist like

696
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
there's an algorithm and then it sends

697
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,200
the buy

698
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,159
order to the unit that makes the

699
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:28,960
purchase

700
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,480
on a market or it sends a certain

701
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,840
piece of information to a different

702
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
computer that then enacts

703
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,320
that like a suggestion

704
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,559
and then even in systems where we know

705
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,919
instructions are being

706
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
sent like computer systems

707
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,440
maybe there's an interactionist way to

708
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
think about that

709
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,400
too any other

710
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,240
thoughts or does optimal control

711
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,760
essentially place all of our

712
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,810
chips on the top down

713
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,200
[Music]

714
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
uh aspect of of the relationship between

715
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
top down and bottom up

716
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
does it does it do it does it optimal

717
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,080
control

718
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,440
say optimization happens exclusively

719
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,240
from

720
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
a top-down directionality and that there

721
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,159
is really no

722
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,600
place for the bottom-up part

723
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
i think it's a good question and i'll

724
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,120
skip to this

725
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,480
fristen 2011 paper

726
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
which is entitled what is optimal about

727
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,559
motor control

728
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,679
right i wonder if um

729
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
that optimality does arise from the top

730
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
or um

731
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
what is optimal once we move beyond

732
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,320
instructionism there's a perfect set of

733
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,840
instructions there's a perfect way to do

734
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,640
it

735
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,159
and then that is either carried out

736
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,799
faithfully or it's not

737
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
that so philosophically if you said

738
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
optimal would be some some

739
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
um openness to both

740
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,559
an ability to recapitulate and an

741
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,640
ability to discover

742
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,799
to be able to put those two things into

743
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,840
some sort of

744
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
coherent relationship um

745
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,679
i'm not saying that that's what is being

746
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,960
said here but

747
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
well i'm just not sure i'm not sure why

748
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,799
we always assume that optimal

749
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,200
is always about being able to create

750
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
copies

751
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
even in scope of skillful skillful

752
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,080
performance

753
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
even compared to a standard there are

754
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,600
things that happen when a gymnast

755
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,320
does their routine where some

756
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,000
some element of the the

757
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,159
variability that applied to that

758
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,279
situation

759
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
is considered when something is being

760
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
judged i think the only thing that

761
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,720
that doesn't doesn't factor in

762
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
variability is the clock

763
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
right like you either ran 9.8 seconds or

764
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
you didn't

765
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,440
but many of the skill skills skillful

766
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
performances that we

767
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,760
pay attention to aren't always about

768
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,120
a recapitulation so

769
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
it's interesting i don't know i i guess

770
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
again it's how you oh how you define it

771
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
but we want to we actually want to get

772
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,080
on to doing something useful here so

773
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
yep and also here's a line in that first

774
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,159
in 2011 that reminds me of

775
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,200
dave's comment which is uh these

776
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
estimates which are coming from a

777
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
predictive processing or active

778
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,120
inference framework can finesse problems

779
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
incurred by sensory delays

780
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,720
in the exchange of signals between the

781
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
central and peripheral

782
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
nervous system so the generative model

783
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,960
can include

784
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
space for that delay when we think about

785
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
just sort of

786
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,200
two people who are talking and

787
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
accounting for each other's delay for

788
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,799
example in that kind of an interaction

789
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,000
versus the send process

790
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
weight send back model

791
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,279
there's actions that happen faster

792
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,880
another example that maybe would be like

793
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,919
baseball

794
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,159
where there's such a small amount of

795
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,000
time to decide whether to initiate

796
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,320
the behavior of swinging

797
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,520
and this paper from 10

798
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
years ago laid out just such an

799
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,360
interesting

800
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,799
difference between value learning

801
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
and active inference which allows for

802
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,640
that

803
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
pragmatic and the epistemic component

804
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,880
the optimal suggests multiple things

805
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
first off it's like it kind of suggests

806
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,360
that there is an optimum that is being

807
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,480
achieved so that's one maybe easier

808
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
way to one easier point just say okay

809
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,799
well maybe there's an optimal way maybe

810
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,080
there's not an optimal

811
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,240
way but what is being optimized is

812
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
the value just like reinforcement

813
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,360
learning

814
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
what's being implicitly optimized here

815
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,799
is

816
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,840
a value function and just as it says

817
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
here the replacement of

818
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
value and cost functions with prior

819
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,799
beliefs about movements

820
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,919
removes the optimal control problem

821
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,480
completely so this idea of the value and

822
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,240
cost it's kind of like an economic

823
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,039
analysis

824
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,840
of motor behavior so then let's just

825
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,320
imagine that any

826
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,279
number of circumstances like somebody um

827
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,960
has a

828
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
belief about how a performance will be

829
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,480
viewed

830
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,200
socially well you could couch that in

831
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
reward and you could try to

832
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,600
go break down from the narrative and the

833
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,360
social all the way down to the movement

834
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,760
of the fingers on the piano

835
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
about the value and well if you mess up

836
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,559
it's a lower value action

837
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,840
but you're getting really far away from

838
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,760
the embodiment of the performance which

839
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,880
maybe doesn't have that same sort of

840
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,159
cost all the way down

841
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,080
so it's like will we have cost functions

842
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
and economics all the way down

843
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,880
and value and cost or will we have

844
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
generative models and an instrumental

845
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,679
way of thinking about

846
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
action blue anything overall

847
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,120
otherwise also anyone who's watching

848
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
lives welcome to ask a related or an

849
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
unrelated question

850
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,760
i'm good anything after last

851
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,919
week's discussion that you'd been

852
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,559
thinking about

853
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,880
um i'm trying to remember last week's

854
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,279
discussion

855
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,720
refresh my memory yep that's what this

856
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
first part is

857
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,559
let's go to figure one and two of the

858
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,440
paper

859
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
and take a more

860
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
formal look at uh and we can go to first

861
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
in 2011 if we want

862
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,080
more details on the similarities and

863
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
differences because this is kind of the

864
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,640
core

865
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
of the contrast between opt

866
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,159
optimal motor control theory and active

867
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
inference it's going to come down to the

868
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,039
differences

869
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,600
in how these models are framed because

870
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,799
there's an interpretive

871
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,760
layer but at the heart of it it's the

872
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,720
differences between

873
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
these two kinds of models between figure

874
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
one and figure two

875
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,919
here so in figure one

876
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,360
uh and we'll go to the juxtaposition

877
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,279
in figure one and figure two we have in

878
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,559
both cases

879
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,799
the plant kinetics which are defined

880
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,159
with the exact same

881
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,200
equations and a sensory

882
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
mapping so this red box

883
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,000
is the same between both of the models

884
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
between control optimal motor control on

885
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,760
the left

886
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,880
and active on the right and

887
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,000
there is still an optimal control

888
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,159
module in active inference so that is

889
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,320
interesting but if we look a little

890
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,200
closer

891
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,239
we can see that in figure one

892
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,040
that uh motor commands that u with a

893
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
tilde over it

894
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,440
it's the minimization so it's

895
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
optimization

896
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,879
minimization maximization sometimes by

897
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,480
minimizing the cost

898
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,760
you maximize the profit or it's

899
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
flippable throw a negative sign in there

900
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,599
and a min becomes a max

901
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
so here what's being minimized

902
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,800
is an integral of

903
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,599
the potentially the cost function c of x

904
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,599
and u

905
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,119
for changes in time so cost is being

906
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,480
minimized through time and that is

907
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,560
optimal control in that framework when

908
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,839
we look at the optimal

909
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,879
control in the active inference

910
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,839
model we see a really different

911
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,800
structure

912
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,079
even of that optimal control module

913
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
we see that u which is playing a similar

914
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,000
role

915
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,960
it's not a command but it's still being

916
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,599
passed this

917
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,119
u of t function is still related to

918
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,680
a minimization but what's happening

919
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,119
inside of the equation

920
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,680
is very different and we can um

921
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,680
go to the first in figure caption to

922
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,800
see what is happening there that

923
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,359
e curly e is the distinction between

924
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,440
exteroceptive which is e with little e

925
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,640
and proprioceptive e with a p reporting

926
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,920
on hidden states

927
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,560
in intrinsic extrinsic and intrinsic

928
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,280
frames of references respectively

929
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
these prediction errors are the

930
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
difference between sensory input

931
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,280
observed and

932
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
predicted so going back to here

933
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,240
what's being minimized isn't the cost

934
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,880
function

935
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,079
through time even

936
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,480
philosophical disagreements with homo

937
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,920
economicus aside okay

938
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,880
let's put aside cost and then then

939
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,400
there's the challenge of assigning costs

940
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,000
to different kinds of states

941
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
what's being minimized here is the cost

942
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,520
through time i mean don't businesses try

943
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
to do that everyone wants to figure out

944
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,839
how to minimize

945
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,000
cost or time it's challenging to do

946
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,599
what's being done here

947
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,480
the minimization between the

948
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
proprioceptive

949
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,880
sensory differential with a

950
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
multiplication potentially

951
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
through time not sure what that does in

952
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
the model

953
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,200
but it's just so interesting that um the

954
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
minimization

955
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,359
here is just like we've talked about in

956
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,079
so many of these discussions it's about

957
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,520
your generative model

958
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,640
of action and sensory outcomes sensory

959
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
outcomes are emitted by hidden

960
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,839
underlying states that you can't

961
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,000
directly observe like you don't know

962
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
exactly whether it's night or day but

963
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
you are getting photons or not

964
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,040
so there's a hidden state that's being

965
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,839
evaluated

966
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
that's the sort of hidden markov model

967
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
component and the hidden state is

968
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
in the model emitting states that are

969
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,119
being observed as sensory outcomes

970
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,680
and in active inference the depth of

971
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
that generative model

972
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,240
is actually such that instead of having

973
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,160
a really rich generative model of cost

974
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,359
functions

975
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,040
and then trying to reverse engineer your

976
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
cost function to find the cheapest

977
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
behavior

978
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,760
the generative model is of expected

979
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,680
sensory outcomes like every time i move

980
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,920
my shoulder here it starts to hurt

981
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
and we don't need to introduce a concept

982
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,359
of

983
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,800
reward or cost into that equation

984
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
we can suffice to say that there is a

985
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,280
generative model of the sensory outcomes

986
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,800
under different motor policies and

987
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,920
the organism has a preference for let's

988
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,640
just say being

989
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,920
in non-painful states

990
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,440
it sidesteps that question of cost

991
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,920
in a way where we can see that even from

992
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
the side by side

993
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,400
even where there is an optimal control

994
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,359
element like a

995
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,839
minimization element what's being

996
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,640
minimized

997
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,680
is something that is very very different

998
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,880
and that's one of the key aspects of

999
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,079
active inference that

1000
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,960
what's being minimized is the divergence

1001
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,520
between

1002
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,560
expected outcomes and realized outcomes

1003
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
that's what of course makes it so

1004
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,560
related to predictive coding predictive

1005
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,920
processing

1006
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,800
rather than drawing only on the

1007
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
reinforcement learning

1008
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,720
type approaches that are doing a

1009
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,160
minimization

1010
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,520
implicitly maximization on reward

1011
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
daniel can i color in a little bit too

1012
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,359
please when i saw this it was

1013
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,720
interesting because

1014
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,480
what i saw was a rep not

1015
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,520
i don't i guess it was a replacement so

1016
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,000
on the figure one it's

1017
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
do estimation

1018
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
and then in figure two what i saw was

1019
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,240
the

1020
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,280
removal of that and the

1021
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,320
application of a rule so

1022
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,520
uh minimize

1023
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,320
uh prediction errors that's the rule as

1024
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
opposed to a step

1025
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,240
and all i thought about was for example

1026
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,920
hippocratic oath i i don't know what i

1027
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
should be doing in terms of this patient

1028
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,480
but the rule is do no harm

1029
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,079
so i think that's what i thought was

1030
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,000
really interesting here is that

1031
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,800
an actual step was replaced with a rule

1032
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,119
and that and that to me was the big

1033
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,560
differentiator

1034
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,079
the introduction of rules that's why i

1035
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,640
asked last week

1036
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
when you changed the rules of the game

1037
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
for the plant

1038
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
i know the affordance has changed and i

1039
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,000
know the tools were introduced and all

1040
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,880
of that stuff

1041
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,320
but i i keep coming back to tools rules

1042
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,359
and pools

1043
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,760
tools being obvious rules being obvious

1044
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
pools just being an aggregation of

1045
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
resources

1046
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
and so i think if you if you're able to

1047
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,119
sort of

1048
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,359
coordinate all three it gives you a

1049
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,880
different sense of what might be going

1050
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
on

1051
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,680
okay a fun thought on that just to

1052
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,160
think about game playing the rules are

1053
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,680
always in effect

1054
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,520
and the rules can be explicit or

1055
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
implicit like it's a rule in chess that

1056
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,359
you have to move out of check or figure

1057
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,640
out how to get out of check

1058
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,480
but then there's sort of what are

1059
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
equivalent to rules like if a piece is

1060
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,839
pinned it can't move

1061
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,280
but you don't need to state that as a

1062
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,160
rule so rules are they're simultaneous

1063
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
they're always in effect unless there's

1064
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,520
another rule and

1065
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,720
they can breed emergence you just say

1066
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
okay there's here's how the pieces move

1067
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,440
and then here's check

1068
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,680
those are the rules and then it's as if

1069
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
there's a rule

1070
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,599
that is you can't move out of a pinned

1071
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,160
piece

1072
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,960
so rules always in effect allow for the

1073
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,240
space of emergence

1074
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,960
steps have to be sequential and so it's

1075
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,640
almost like we're moving from

1076
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,319
the um within a round of a game

1077
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,920
that's the instructionist okay you're

1078
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
playing risk first

1079
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,240
roll the die now see whether the three

1080
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,599
is higher than the two die or whatever

1081
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,880
it happens to be

1082
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,240
and interactionism is pulling us back

1083
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,960
to like the rules in the pattern that

1084
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,760
still

1085
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,200
there can be sequential instructions or

1086
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,680
sequential information can occur

1087
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,839
but it is very different to have

1088
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,880
rules rather than specified steps so

1089
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,680
let's see

1090
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
we're building up yeah go ahead i just

1091
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
want one last thing so when i would ask

1092
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,800
young people

1093
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,880
to watch a video clip of something and i

1094
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
would ask them to

1095
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,560
draw three columns and title them tools

1096
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,760
rules and pools

1097
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,359
and find examples find tokens of each

1098
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,960
what do you think was the easiest thing

1099
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,280
for them to accumulate under

1100
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,000
it was tools yes those those have got

1101
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,800
the edges

1102
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
what was that what was the second

1103
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,960
highest aggregation

1104
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,599
pools because they could they could

1105
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,040
literally figure out

1106
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,359
what was congregating what was the

1107
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,240
hardest thing

1108
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
the parallel processing which is what

1109
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,680
you just described

1110
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
it's always going off the sequential is

1111
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,440
much easier

1112
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,560
to account for the parallel processing

1113
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
the happening as co-occurrence

1114
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,720
is the hardest thing for people when

1115
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,079
when you're walking into a novel

1116
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,200
situation

1117
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,319
to take account of so that's you can

1118
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,040
you can say it it's just being aware of

1119
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,200
it and finding examples of it

1120
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,319
that's really really hard for most minds

1121
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,720
so even from a computational aspect

1122
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,319
right like the

1123
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,040
parallelizing functions make them like

1124
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
speed up so much right but

1125
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,880
it's they also like are so

1126
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,040
computationally intensive right

1127
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,720
yeah exactly dave has another

1128
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,280
great comment on this slide he wrote um

1129
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
i'm looking for where time is applied in

1130
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,560
the two approaches

1131
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,640
the intrinsic frame of reference for

1132
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
active is

1133
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
u tilde of t so that's um we'll

1134
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
zoom in a little bit on just figure two

1135
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,119
here's that u-tilde of t

1136
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,640
passing through the intrinsic frame of

1137
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
reference um

1138
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,280
but there's no explicit t in the optimal

1139
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,119
control formula we can just see that

1140
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,520
motor commands utilda are passed

1141
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,920
so there's kind of like a timelessness

1142
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,640
to con you know contract this muscle

1143
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,040
it's not contract this muscle now it's

1144
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,839
actually just

1145
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,119
um a timeless statement so

1146
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,760
t he says whereas t is inside the

1147
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,880
optimal control

1148
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,560
formula um here is t

1149
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,599
uh dt it's a derivative through time

1150
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,680
and not in the intrinsic frame of

1151
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,200
reference

1152
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,319
as seen in active so he asks whether

1153
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,599
that tells us where

1154
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,440
the approaches are taking account of

1155
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,359
time differently i think that's a great

1156
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,640
question is how does time play um

1157
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,160
a role differently in these two

1158
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,560
frameworks let's keep on

1159
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,400
looking for similarities and differences

1160
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,880
so we have rules not steps for active

1161
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,440
inference

1162
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,839
we introduce a time dependence of that

1163
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,880
downward

1164
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,160
motor signal um we have of course a deep

1165
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,480
generative model component

1166
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,240
we have state estimation is that's the

1167
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,560
um the hamlet joke there's this whole

1168
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,280
module

1169
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,160
that's clearly different in optimal

1170
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,200
motor control

1171
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,240
which is the state estimation and that's

1172
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
what doesn't need to be done

1173
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,880
in active inference is this state

1174
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
estimation

1175
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,400
of okay given the sensory input we're

1176
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,960
getting

1177
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
like i'm getting um you know two-thirds

1178
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,960
of my proprio receptors here and

1179
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,800
one-third here are firing so

1180
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,680
let's estimate that the arm is here okay

1181
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,000
now

1182
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
pass that to the next part of the model

1183
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,640
given that the arm is here

1184
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
what do we want to get the arm to

1185
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
okay now given which side of where we

1186
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
want the arm to go to

1187
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,599
we estimate the optimal and the actual r

1188
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,359
send the command you know turn the

1189
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,040
steering wheel to the side

1190
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,240
to bring it into alignment with the

1191
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,480
optimal or the most rewarding state

1192
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,040
so state estimation is in optimal motor

1193
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,079
control theory

1194
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,040
but an active inference you just don't

1195
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,160
have it

1196
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,800
and that's sort of an interesting piece

1197
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,200
to

1198
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,319
drop out of the model because

1199
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,839
we don't need to have an explicit

1200
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,720
representation

1201
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,040
or an explicit variable with the

1202
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
location of the arm

1203
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,800
so that's a rule

1204
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
it's like john cage everybody has the

1205
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,079
best seat

1206
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,119
it's almost like it's enough to just say

1207
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,760
you're on the ocean you're sailing and

1208
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,160
then

1209
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,040
you're going to be trying to reduce your

1210
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,480
uncertainty

1211
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,200
as you pursue policies that in your

1212
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,480
generative model of the world which

1213
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,440
includes latent

1214
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,520
causes so the degenerative model

1215
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,359
includes like latent causes of the world

1216
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
which are not anywhere to be seen in

1217
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,640
this

1218
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040
um optimal motor control theory like

1219
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,480
there's a deep latent cause that if too

1220
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,520
much weight is on

1221
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,240
you know this branch it's going to break

1222
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:14,560
but

1223
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,000
where is that the constraints of the

1224
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,480
niche

1225
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
or something that's deep detonation not

1226
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,599
there so anyways

1227
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,200
it's like you're in the boat you want to

1228
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,800
be reducing your uncertainty

1229
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
about getting the sensory states that

1230
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,160
you want like

1231
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,040
seeing that land look bigger reflecting

1232
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,640
you being closer

1233
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,760
but you don't need to have that gps

1234
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,400
coordinate

1235
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,319
where am i okay now where do i want to

1236
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,720
be and how are we going to get there

1237
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
it's enough to actually have a sensory

1238
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
preference

1239
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,880
and then reduce your uncertainty on the

1240
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,640
trajectory of reaching

1241
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,240
that sensory outcome so that's

1242
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,359
a big difference in active inference

1243
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,640
and i'm seeing even a few more

1244
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,040
let's look at the green boxes so in the

1245
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,760
green box

1246
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,839
for figure one we have a forward model

1247
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,200
so they write that the function of the

1248
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,119
forward model

1249
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,240
is to improve the execution of action

1250
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,520
it's kind of funny executive

1251
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,440
executive office or the executive

1252
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,280
component of the government it's about

1253
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,960
executing that's where the instructions

1254
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,839
are issued from executive orders

1255
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,920
improve the execution of action by

1256
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,160
helping to finesse the inferences of the

1257
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,040
state

1258
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,400
estimator so again it's in feedback with

1259
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,520
the state estimate and then it's sending

1260
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,040
an effort copy

1261
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,720
so that's outgoing is efference

1262
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,800
and so there's this feedback between the

1263
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,920
prediction

1264
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,920
of um basically where

1265
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,480
the body is in this case and then

1266
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
that gets sent it's kind of interesting

1267
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,760
that the x comes from the state

1268
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,599
estimation that's the where

1269
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,559
is the arm and then the forward model is

1270
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,119
the forward model of motor control

1271
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,040
that is what connects with this u tilde

1272
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,359
that's the green box that forward model

1273
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,079
in

1274
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,359
optimal motor control whereas

1275
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,119
in active inference we have a different

1276
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,200
forward model it's a forward model of x

1277
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,240
as well as v which is the prior belief

1278
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,520
so again there doesn't need to be

1279
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,559
um a forward model of position and motor

1280
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,599
action

1281
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,880
as happening here it's enough

1282
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,200
potentially to have a model of

1283
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,119
action um and over beliefs

1284
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,319
we can look at the first in um caption

1285
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:46,960
to see

1286
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,319
a little bit more closely

1287
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,839
uh yeah any thoughts on that

1288
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,359
i think the state estimator to go back

1289
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,359
i think one live stream state estimator

1290
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,520
says that there have to be ties between

1291
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,720
the two rails

1292
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,000
to stabilize those ties so that some

1293
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
processing can take place

1294
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
i think what this talks about is the

1295
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,520
fact that we know that there's a

1296
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,000
gradient

1297
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,319
we know the train is going to roll

1298
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,440
downhill

1299
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,240
as long as there's a gradient it's a

1300
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,200
rule

1301
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,680
as opposed to trying to stabilize the

1302
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,839
relationship between the ties

1303
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,960
of the railroad two very different

1304
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,440
ways of looking at something and i think

1305
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,559
that

1306
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,200
um this goes kind of back to what i said

1307
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
i think there are times

1308
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,280
when we do give ourselves instructions

1309
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,880
and then there are times when we simply

1310
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,839
parallel

1311
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,640
process because we have a rule i don't

1312
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,240
want to make mistakes

1313
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,440
because that doesn't serve my my goals

1314
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,800
or my target

1315
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,559
and i think all i i again i just suggest

1316
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,800
that the inclusion of both

1317
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
is probably to our advantage it's just

1318
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,720
that what we tend to do

1319
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,079
is give all of our we've been trained to

1320
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,720
give all of our

1321
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,200
attention over to making sure that the

1322
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,319
thing is stabilized

1323
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,599
nice also one piece of first in 2011

1324
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,079
that's not

1325
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,839
brought over to this paper figure one

1326
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,839
was that motor control

1327
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,319
figure two is predictive coding and

1328
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,520
motor control

1329
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,040
so already we see the reduction of the

1330
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,839
model

1331
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,359
in the terms of the state estimate goes

1332
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,520
away you don't need to explicitly have a

1333
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,880
state estimator because the state

1334
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,680
estimator

1335
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,760
has now been subsumed into the forward

1336
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,359
model which is why crucially

1337
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,559
the mapping from hidden states to

1338
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,160
sensations is now part of the forward

1339
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,359
generative model

1340
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,760
so we have a generative model of what we

1341
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,559
expect

1342
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,880
and now with predictive coding instead

1343
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,960
of keeping a variable of

1344
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,760
what we think is happening we just have

1345
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,280
which is can be tracked through time and

1346
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,240
all that

1347
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,480
we're simplifying that state estimator

1348
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,359
by including

1349
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,800
the expectations about the state

1350
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
estimator in our forward model

1351
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,280
that's predictive coding how does that

1352
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,160
differentiate

1353
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,119
from active inference so that's a good

1354
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:11,599
question

1355
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,599
here we have plant kinetics sensory

1356
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,720
mappings

1357
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,200
forward model and optimal control with a

1358
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,960
cost function still coming in

1359
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,200
you still see that integral with the

1360
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,400
minimization

1361
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,760
of motor commands u over

1362
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,760
time whereas in active inference again

1363
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,040
we're moving from it's more valuable to

1364
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,960
be getting the signals i like and i like

1365
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
rewarding things

1366
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,319
to i'm just bringing the sensory

1367
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,200
outcomes

1368
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,839
into alignment with expectations and i'm

1369
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,760
selecting policies based upon which ones

1370
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,079
i think are going to get me there

1371
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,200
and then this section that um

1372
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,800
i had highlighted in summary the tenet

1373
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,319
of optimal control

1374
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,240
lies in the reduction of optimal motion

1375
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,640
to flow on a value function

1376
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
like the downhill flow of water so

1377
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,319
that's pragmatic value

1378
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,480
and that's awesome because think about

1379
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,359
how much work

1380
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,280
has been done on information flows in

1381
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,440
the last 10 years

1382
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,960
conversely in active inference the flow

1383
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,640
is specified directly in terms of the

1384
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
equations of motion that constitute

1385
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,200
prior beliefs like patterns of wind flow

1386
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,839
the essential difference so how do we go

1387
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,480
from

1388
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,640
water going downhill on the value you

1389
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,319
know gradient descent

1390
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,319
or up and down again they kind of get

1391
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,440
flipped around but

1392
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,200
how do we go from just thinking about

1393
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,119
what direction does gravity take you

1394
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,680
that's value that's reward there's one

1395
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,520
answer you know which policy

1396
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,000
for financial outcomes is going to have

1397
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,559
a higher

1398
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,839
value that's that scalar estimate of

1399
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,839
value

1400
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,359
the essential difference is that prior

1401
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,960
beliefs in active inference

1402
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,760
can include solenoidal flow so this is

1403
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
where we're opening up the whole

1404
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,599
discussion of play so i hope that we can

1405
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,359
think about that for a second

1406
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,040
and fristen says you know he doesn't

1407
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
want to overstate the shortcomings of

1408
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,240
optimal control

1409
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,079
so it's not that you can't introduce a

1410
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,599
solenoidal component

1411
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,760
to value you can have the idea of

1412
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,880
solenoidal flow

1413
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,520
circulating on iso contours but how many

1414
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,480
businesses stop

1415
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,480
and say you know let's not pick the most

1416
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,400
rewarding number

1417
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,040
let's look for maybe it's not the most

1418
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,559
rewarding number but then there's the

1419
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,040
most

1420
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,240
solenoidal play around that number

1421
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,680
people say but we're not going to be

1422
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,280
doing those so

1423
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,640
why would we stop at you know 5 000 feet

1424
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,319
when we know that we can get to 6 000

1425
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,920
feet and

1426
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,200
solenoidal flow and the ability to have

1427
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,760
that

1428
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,880
pragmatic and epidemic that directed and

1429
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,040
the solenoidal components

1430
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,960
opens up the space of play hopefully so

1431
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,040
what do you think about that or does

1432
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,240
that

1433
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,040
i'll put up this slide where we had

1434
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,119
separated out this optima motor control

1435
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,040
theory with a value only

1436
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
that's the one thing that this robot is

1437
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,319
tracking is

1438
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,520
the slope and the altitude it's

1439
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
following is uphill as much as it can so

1440
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,520
it can get to the top of

1441
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,880
mount value whereas in active inference

1442
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,760
we're using the helmholtz decomposition

1443
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,599
which is related to the physics of flow

1444
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,760
on vector fields that is going to reduce

1445
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800
to these two irreducibly

1446
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,480
separated components so like they're

1447
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,000
totally orthogonal they don't have

1448
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,200
redundant information

1449
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,599
they have totally separate information

1450
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,280
there is the value component the

1451
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,319
straight line

1452
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,319
but there's also this equal value

1453
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,720
solenoidal flow

1454
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,240
any thoughts on that

1455
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,559
you explained it really well here's a

1456
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,240
comment from dave if while

1457
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,359
people are thinking um giving oneself

1458
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,160
instructions

1459
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,400
can refer to something real and useful

1460
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
if one interprets the execution of the

1461
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,319
instruction appropriately

1462
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,079
i'm referring to playing a piece of

1463
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,680
music without touching the instruments

1464
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,280
which can be nearly as effective as

1465
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,200
actually playing

1466
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,880
if the challenge is to simply touch the

1467
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,559
right stops at the right moments this

1468
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,440
can actually be

1469
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,400
more affecting empowered machine

1470
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,160
operators may seem less efficient

1471
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,079
than highly regimented ones but may over

1472
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,359
time get to far

1473
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,480
more effective overall operations

1474
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,760
dean what do you think about that again

1475
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,319
i completely agree okay

1476
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,440
yeah so my my only question is so why

1477
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,839
are

1478
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,960
more people not picking up on the

1479
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,200
potential of this and the value of

1480
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,240
having both

1481
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,359
an awareness of both

1482
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,680
so i think like it's maybe just getting

1483
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,599
started in a computational

1484
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,920
way i mean we've we've explored some

1485
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,040
computation

1486
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,480
papers um looking at you know

1487
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,799
how to optimize a given task

1488
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,079
computationally

1489
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,119
so i think that it will um

1490
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,240
gain traction right it's just so new

1491
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,559
i mean not active inference as a concept

1492
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,440
but um

1493
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,040
the practical applications of active

1494
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,799
inference i think are um

1495
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,280
just starting to be explored and i think

1496
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,400
that the play

1497
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,440
um aspect is is

1498
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,040
important i mean because it's it's like

1499
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,280
how we learn right exploring or playing

1500
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,079
or or

1501
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,240
um you know these types of things give

1502
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,480
rise to to real learning

1503
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,119
uh even if it's accidental learning like

1504
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:27,520
not

1505
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,640
necessarily effort directed

1506
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,839
yeah i think i think it's also

1507
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,079
i think it's something some has to do

1508
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,839
with um

1509
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,760
a perception that

1510
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,359
play doesn't necessarily generate value

1511
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,599
which is kind of sad because there's so

1512
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,400
many examples where it does

1513
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,079
the outcomes of play caused your mind to

1514
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,839
go off in so many because it's supposed

1515
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,359
to be about distribution

1516
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,079
this is a kind of a way of of of

1517
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,160
encouraging that distribution and yet

1518
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
for some reason it just doesn't get the

1519
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,760
same

1520
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,520
respect so

1521
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,280
i'm just thinking about the um pipeline

1522
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,040
from basic to translational to applied

1523
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,400
to sort of infused research

1524
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,640
like once oh everybody knows that you

1525
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,599
know that what

1526
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,680
what was once basic though becomes

1527
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,880
applied and then becomes

1528
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
every day so let's just imagine that

1529
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,799
we're going to shooting on that skilled

1530
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,319
performance slide

1531
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,119
well if we have implicitly or explicitly

1532
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,720
if we're working under this

1533
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,680
optimal motor control function we're

1534
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,559
thinking

1535
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,640
okay maybe people's biomechanics differ

1536
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,640
but for each person's biomechanics there

1537
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,000
is an optimal way

1538
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,799
to shoot a free throw and we want people

1539
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,319
to have a more accurate

1540
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,920
modeling of where their hand is on the

1541
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,000
ball so that they can execute

1542
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,079
the movement better so that we can get

1543
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,920
the reward you know score the points put

1544
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,200
the ball in the hoop

1545
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,319
and so it relates to

1546
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,599
having people practice or maybe get

1547
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,559
input on

1548
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,319
your hand was a little bit off here

1549
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,000
relative to the coach's

1550
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,319
expectations of where the hand should be

1551
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,599
um

1552
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,280
but then there's this whole question

1553
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,640
about visualization

1554
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,280
and about what dave was saying like

1555
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,880
playing the music without touching the

1556
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,000
instrument

1557
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,760
and the ability that was almost

1558
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,079
discovered in a bottom-up way

1559
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,119
of changing beliefs about one's

1560
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,400
performance

1561
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,440
rehearsing mentally but also changing

1562
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,559
beliefs about performance

1563
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,680
influencing motor behavior that

1564
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,000
is more consistent with what we see in

1565
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
active inference

1566
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,280
and so there's just multiple things that

1567
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,760
previously would be seen as sort of

1568
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,720
exceptions

1569
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,359
or quirks of a pure motor control

1570
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,559
system like incorporating these

1571
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,119
deeper elements of our generative model

1572
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:01,920
um

1573
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,680
all the way up to even like the

1574
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,359
psychological like maybe your generative

1575
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:05,920
model

1576
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,720
is that your team is fated to lose so

1577
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,799
then you do choke in that moment because

1578
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:11,280
like

1579
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,040
you know you didn't psychologically want

1580
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,400
to win or whatever

1581
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,799
and that's as gina's we're always joking

1582
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,079
about like the interview with the

1583
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,440
athletes right after the game

1584
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,599
it's like i wanted to win or something

1585
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,839
like that like

1586
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,680
they're not going to give you that third

1587
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,040
person

1588
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,280
my hand you know was on the wrong spot

1589
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,880
on the ball

1590
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,280
um it just we're seeing how

1591
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,000
now as we have just like blue said more

1592
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,760
computational modeling

1593
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,480
that recognizes interactionism and that

1594
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,880
recognizes deep generative models

1595
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,240
it will be possible to start to slide

1596
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240
some of these examples from being like

1597
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,079
quirky outliers

1598
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,359
to actually sketching out the structure

1599
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,799
of inference and action instead of just

1600
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,240
being seen as sort of like

1601
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,599
this one weird trick that's going to

1602
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,359
help you learn free throws

1603
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,880
it'll be like that's always about your

1604
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,480
generative model

1605
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,319
and that includes you as being a team

1606
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,240
player for example it always is going to

1607
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:10,880
include that

1608
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,680
and then it's going to come down to

1609
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,000
maybe

1610
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,440
being modeled better by active inference

1611
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,359
rather than a reward based framework

1612
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,280
blue

1613
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,440
so i just was thinking like you know in

1614
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,720
your you said

1615
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,559
you were exploring like the the dynamic

1616
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,839
you were you were going through the

1617
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,839
dynamic there was like exploration and

1618
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,280
then doing something intentionally like

1619
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,559
learning how to do it and then like

1620
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,079
perfecting a skill

1621
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,920
right i was thinking like you left off

1622
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,280
the end of that like

1623
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,319
uh just like from a societal like

1624
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,799
standpoint right like we explore new

1625
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,559
things like not thinking as an organism

1626
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,359
but thinking as

1627
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,520
as a social structure we explore new

1628
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,040
things we set out the intention to

1629
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,720
complete those new things we perfect

1630
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,599
those new things

1631
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,400
and then we forget them right like so so

1632
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,599
does that come into play

1633
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,680
in in this i wonder because i think

1634
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,680
about scaling active inference a lot

1635
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,400
like from

1636
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,520
not in the way that we talked about

1637
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,920
scaling active inference um in the paper

1638
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,760
scaling active inference but but just as

1639
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,079
as from uh like you know small

1640
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,319
components of a system to systems

1641
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,040
and you know in that scaling like like

1642
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:11,520
so

1643
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,040
are we missing something about about

1644
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,200
forgetting right like like handwriting

1645
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,040
if you think about like learning cursive

1646
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,160
you know that was something like people

1647
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,839
start out scribbling on paper little

1648
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,119
kids you know they're playing and

1649
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,400
they're drawing and whatever and then

1650
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:22,720
they

1651
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,240
they intend to learn cursive they

1652
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,480
perfect cursive but but like as a

1653
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,240
society we're not teaching that anymore

1654
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,520
so they don't know cursive

1655
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,119
and it's like typing like now we have

1656
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,040
voice translations so we don't know

1657
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,960
typing anymore i mean at these types of

1658
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,119
things like are influential in a society

1659
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:37,680
so

1660
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,319
does that come into play here like where

1661
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,520
i've talked about before

1662
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,200
you know thinking about doing something

1663
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,880
like entering the flow state right when

1664
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,400
we talked about the flow last

1665
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,319
live stream you know it's like you have

1666
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,920
the intention to do something and like

1667
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,280
you think about doing something but when

1668
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,359
you're really a skilled performer

1669
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,599
you enter that flow state and you forget

1670
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,880
about doing it you just

1671
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,520
do it it's just magically accomplished

1672
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,400
so is that like

1673
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,880
flow state comparable to this like

1674
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,160
forgetting

1675
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,200
of as a society right so so when you

1676
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,039
enter that flow state and like you're

1677
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,640
doing something magically like just with

1678
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,400
your kinesthetic memory

1679
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,240
and you're perfect at it does that

1680
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,400
compare to society like forgetting a

1681
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,000
task because we've already mastered it

1682
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,559
like we're

1683
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,920
we forgot about that we're on to the

1684
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,920
next thing i wonder if that's relevant

1685
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,079
anyway sorry if i rambled

1686
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,559
no it's it's really nice here's what it

1687
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,079
made me think about was

1688
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,160
instructions again implicitly or

1689
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,359
explicitly

1690
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,359
they have to be remembered or forgotten

1691
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,799
because if they're not remembered

1692
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,280
along the chain or at least in the ram

1693
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,319
of the computer it's like

1694
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,000
they're never carried out if the

1695
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,839
instruct if you started a sentence and

1696
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,359
they forgot what the first part was by

1697
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,400
the end of the step

1698
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,720
they can't carry out the instructions so

1699
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,880
instructions we think about symbolic

1700
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,720
representation remembering and

1701
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,760
forgetting but with interactions

1702
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,079
it doesn't have to be remembered or

1703
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,480
forgotten it's actually just experienced

1704
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,039
like in the ant colony the interactions

1705
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,440
between ants they don't have to be

1706
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,119
remembered it updates the generative

1707
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,720
model of each nest mate

1708
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,480
and then they continue on their path

1709
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,720
but it's actually just experienced and

1710
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,079
that's enough

1711
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,039
in an interactionist framework rather

1712
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,960
than being remembered

1713
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,839
i'm not sure if that gets at it i think

1714
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,520
it's a great point about how

1715
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,119
as something becomes pervasive and other

1716
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:27,920
skills

1717
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,640
and scaffolds are layered over it there

1718
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,880
is a forgetting that can happen

1719
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,440
but also just it's like we don't even

1720
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,960
need to have

1721
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,520
memorization of everything like i

1722
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,079
remember

1723
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,680
hearing from different college majors

1724
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,119
and somebody would say somebody would

1725
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,400
say what major they were

1726
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,920
and somebody else would say oh well that

1727
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,079
one always was too much memorization

1728
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,200
like there was that was too much

1729
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,760
memorizing and then for that person

1730
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,440
it wouldn't be it was their major it

1731
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,839
wouldn't be too much memorizing

1732
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,920
it just seemed like it was parts of a

1733
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,520
bigger picture and so they didn't feel

1734
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,799
like they were memorizing little

1735
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,480
factoids

1736
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,559
but rather just interacting with the

1737
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,000
material

1738
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,359
not sure dean what do you think about

1739
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,039
that well

1740
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,039
blue you didn't say this but you touched

1741
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,240
on something that's

1742
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,920
mattered to me for a really long time

1743
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,520
and that is

1744
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,960
should we scale bottom up

1745
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,170
or does it sort of exist in its own

1746
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,400
[Music]

1747
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,720
realm because that's the thing that you

1748
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,680
basically said

1749
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,960
i i i taught for a lot of time

1750
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,440
and it bothered me greatly that all the

1751
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,240
learning from

1752
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,960
from haptic movement was disappearing

1753
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,119
into a keyboard

1754
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,400
so so so we topped down that one

1755
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,799
and then we forgot about it because top

1756
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:43,520
down

1757
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,480
basically erased the bottom up we we

1758
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,160
seem to think

1759
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,039
that if we talk down it if we if we give

1760
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,400
it a nap

1761
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,319
we can now forget about it and i find

1762
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,880
that i find that crazy because i've had

1763
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,160
many quite

1764
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,200
quite heated debates with people who

1765
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,000
want

1766
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,319
to take another bottom-up exercise where

1767
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,760
we can really learn

1768
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,480
something and get some joy out of

1769
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,359
discovery

1770
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,440
and say well that's i'm going to scale

1771
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,119
that and i say leave it alone

1772
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,200
leave it alone it's a bottom-up thing

1773
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,720
what are you doing

1774
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,039
i know you can top down it but why can't

1775
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:23,920
we just

1776
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,480
let it explore a little bit and figure

1777
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,880
things out for itself

1778
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,480
so dean you really touched on something

1779
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,160
there with like the haptic

1780
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,359
movement um and you know i

1781
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,119
like personally learn super well by

1782
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,680
writing things down like i take notes i

1783
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,039
throw the notes away i never look back

1784
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,880
at them again

1785
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,720
it's the act of physically writing

1786
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,400
something down that helps me

1787
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,880
uh learn um and i mean sometimes i do

1788
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,160
look back at my notes but but

1789
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,400
mostly not i just take them to to commit

1790
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,359
things to memory

1791
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,280
and um you know my daughter was really

1792
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,720
struggling with

1793
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,400
uh learning her times tables right she's

1794
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,839
like doing these flash cards and the

1795
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,359
quizlet app and all the stuff

1796
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,680
and i had her manually copy you know

1797
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,200
like the times tables and

1798
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,520
you know instantly like within a month

1799
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,720
she had them down

1800
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,319
um and just like destroyed the

1801
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,920
standardized tests like where they do

1802
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,760
math computation which is just like

1803
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,680
rote memorization of your math facts and

1804
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,799
how fast can you do it

1805
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,440
she got like 100 and she's you know at

1806
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:21,920
like

1807
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
off the charts for her grade level in

1808
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,960
testing so

1809
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,559
um anyway it's it's really very um

1810
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,240
real and actual but but in that

1811
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,000
kinesthetic memory and this goes

1812
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,880
back to that like motor command you know

1813
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,359
and like the disappearance of the motor

1814
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,319
command

1815
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,559
and so this is like what i think about

1816
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,400
like these two juxtapositions and i

1817
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,119
think like

1818
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,839
there is a space like where you do issue

1819
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,880
a motor command so

1820
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,720
like at least for me right like there is

1821
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,319
a space where it's like okay

1822
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,760
i need to put my right foot in front of

1823
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,680
my left foot and you know walk along to

1824
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,520
learn to balance like i'm issuing a

1825
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,240
command

1826
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,200
to myself to execute some task but but

1827
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,640
there are many times like where you do

1828
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,039
not

1829
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,880
issue that motor command you i mean like

1830
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,480
think about like if you've ever tried to

1831
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,000
learn to play the piano like placing

1832
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,799
your fingers on

1833
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,640
the keys and stuff and then it just you

1834
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,240
just do it right like there's no

1835
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,240
command at that space and so so there's

1836
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,640
like a mental a kinesthetic like

1837
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,760
something that happens

1838
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,839
like where you transition between having

1839
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,119
to issue the command and

1840
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,039
not having to issue the command and this

1841
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,720
is something that i you know i'm excited

1842
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,640
to talk to the authors about if they

1843
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,240
are able to join us on a live stream

1844
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,079
because i because i don't know where is

1845
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,839
that step where does that step

1846
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,920
get erased in active inference i mean we

1847
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
aren't always

1848
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,559
just we aren't always commandless i

1849
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,160
think i don't know

1850
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,280
so i'll just put one more one last thing

1851
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,480
on that if

1852
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,720
if i think of myself if i think of

1853
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,039
myself separately from the neck down

1854
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,720
everything from the neck down is giving

1855
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,880
me the bottom up

1856
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,240
my brain is way up here there's things

1857
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,000
that are supporting that that are giving

1858
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,799
me that chance to bottom up i don't want

1859
01:07:58,799 --> 01:07:59,920
those things

1860
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,599
to disappear i don't want to be a head

1861
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,119
on a on a cart

1862
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,119
i don't want to be like that plant with

1863
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,319
just my head

1864
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,160
going back and forth between lights

1865
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,000
right like when do we

1866
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,480
stop saying that everything has to and

1867
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,119
like i said

1868
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,920
you didn't say this but i've had so many

1869
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,359
people say oh

1870
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,279
dean if you if you all the stuff that

1871
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,799
you're doing is great and you

1872
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,399
you create all these unicorns and all

1873
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,799
these young people are able to go out

1874
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,960
and contribute in professional settings

1875
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,158
but it's not scalable and i go

1876
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,238
what what do you mean it's not scalable

1877
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,560
every one of these things is a bottom-up

1878
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,759
example that it it can happen as long as

1879
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,719
you don't try to

1880
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,399
top down it to death

1881
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,759
interesting the part about the body and

1882
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,238
the

1883
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,000
neck reminded me of ken wilbur's centaur

1884
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,719
stage of development which is sort of

1885
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:55,359
like

1886
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,399
uh along the integral psychological

1887
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,920
trajectory

1888
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,158
there's a step where there it's like

1889
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:03,040
half human

1890
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,920
half horse and so it's like one step

1891
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,040
beyond kind of

1892
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,600
a human in dialogue with a horse as two

1893
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,799
separate entities

1894
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,000
there starts to be like a fusion in

1895
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,640
his framework moving towards non-dual

1896
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,839
framings

1897
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,719
but there's that stage where it's like

1898
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,399
uh the top down the bottom up but you

1899
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,279
know our brain

1900
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,560
is further out just gravitationally

1901
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,359
so it makes it seem like it's the top

1902
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,000
down

1903
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,960
piece but you know what about a person

1904
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,600
upside down

1905
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,000
then is it bottom-up signaling well

1906
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,359
you've already pointed em out he's on

1907
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,040
the edge of a building back there about

1908
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,839
ten slides

1909
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,000
or people on the other side of the world

1910
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,279
they're upside down

1911
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,439
right uh and i think uh asking about

1912
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,880
speech and sign language

1913
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,640
could be interesting because i think

1914
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,719
those are gonna be the challenge

1915
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,199
cases for symbolic

1916
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,400
the last bastion of instructionism

1917
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,480
and symbolic messages being passed

1918
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,960
maybe is happening through language

1919
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,960
whereas with this sort of elegant

1920
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,840
skillful performance model maybe you go

1921
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,040
okay i can see where predictive

1922
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,800
processing is coming into play

1923
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,120
where it's not just about value okay so

1924
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,719
if predictive processing is an

1925
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,520
improvement

1926
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,719
from reinforcement learning um or

1927
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,640
from optimal motor control then i guess

1928
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,239
i could see why active inference builds

1929
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:30,800
upon

1930
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,480
predictive processing so that's that's

1931
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,719
the pipeline the active

1932
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,800
down the rabbit hole pipeline for some

1933
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,760
but i think

1934
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,800
when it actually is semantic or symbolic

1935
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,320
what is being performed that'll be

1936
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,480
where on one hand there's going to be

1937
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,440
resistance

1938
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,800
because it's going to seem the most

1939
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,360
instructionist but on the other hand i

1940
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,320
think we're going to tap

1941
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,239
into the richness of active inference to

1942
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,400
have a deep generative model

1943
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,679
including semantic information whereas

1944
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,960
the semantics are not

1945
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,800
in this motor control framing

1946
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,360
so it'll be like double or nothing with

1947
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,280
active inference

1948
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,880
for some of the symbolic cases uh blue

1949
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,960
yeah i just wanted to go back to what um

1950
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,480
dean was saying earlier about

1951
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,560
bottom up and um like i don't know uh

1952
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,280
like using active inference and modeling

1953
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,640
active inference in

1954
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,920
like a bottom-up and nested way is super

1955
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,120
super interesting to me

1956
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,000
um and and i just i'm i'm wondering like

1957
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,239
when are we gonna crack that walnut

1958
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,840
because it's gonna happen i feel like

1959
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,679
we're we're teetering you know

1960
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,400
on the edge of that um what will that

1961
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:40,960
look like

1962
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,120
i mean yeah what will it look like or

1963
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
what will be a system where we can

1964
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,159
explore it in

1965
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,760
i mean maybe the active in france i

1966
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,520
think is maybe maybe daniel will grace

1967
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,000
us with we get to do his paper one day

1968
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,280
we can do it soon but yeah the only

1969
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,719
thing i'll add is that we have to

1970
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,640
people that are participating in this

1971
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,880
and really are going oh my goodness

1972
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,199
we're really on the cusp of something

1973
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,080
just have to be willing to go over the

1974
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,000
edge of the cliff

1975
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,920
and i'm not and i'm not joking it's the

1976
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,880
letting go of all the habits that we

1977
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,520
formed to get to this place because most

1978
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,520
people didn't get to we didn't

1979
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,719
the three of us didn't get here through

1980
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,360
active inference that came after a whole

1981
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,120
bunch of things that were more

1982
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,640
instructionalist and to what to step

1983
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,920
back it would be much easier than to go

1984
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,080
over if we've got the prospecting the

1985
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,360
proposition

1986
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,920
and the provisions in place we'll go

1987
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,280
over the edge

1988
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,440
and it'll all be fine it'll be actually

1989
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,159
quite thrilling

1990
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,280
i i really like that like uh sort of

1991
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,880
that come to the edge

1992
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,120
there's a different thought chain when

1993
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,480
you're climbing the ladder to the high

1994
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:54,880
jump

1995
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,560
like we've all jumped off of something

1996
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,239
that was

1997
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,880
scary or something like that there's a

1998
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,080
different thought process when you're

1999
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:02,560
climbing

2000
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,480
maybe because your motor behavior is

2001
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,320
grounded you're on the ladder or you're

2002
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
on the mountain going up

2003
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,520
that's one mode that's actually like

2004
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,320
approach

2005
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,280
but then right at the end the mind goes

2006
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,400
blank

2007
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,800
and you know the mind will say jump jump

2008
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,000
jump

2009
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,320
but there's that resistance and that

2010
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,600
reminds me one of the few times that

2011
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,239
i've used

2012
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,440
vr goggles um

2013
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,440
it was like you walked into an elevator

2014
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,960
this was like a scenario walk into an

2015
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,080
elevator

2016
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,440
and then it carried you up a building

2017
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,719
and you could see yourself getting

2018
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,239
higher and higher up

2019
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,120
and then the elevator doors opened and

2020
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,080
you looked down

2021
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,800
and it was just like dropping off a

2022
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,080
building

2023
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,600
and it felt like my foot was just glued

2024
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,480
to the ground

2025
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,040
like i felt like i could not take a step

2026
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,679
forward

2027
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,600
even though i could inch my foot forward

2028
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,880
and i could see that it was

2029
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,280
that i hadn't moved that i was still

2030
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,040
just on flat ground

2031
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,159
it was like it just

2032
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,440
stopped motor behavior to know that it

2033
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,320
would be

2034
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,040
resulting in some unpleasant situations

2035
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,480
in the usual case

2036
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,320
so dean what do we say to those

2037
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,880
who are um you know not sure if they

2038
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,360
want to

2039
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,600
go to the cliff what do we say to those

2040
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,280
who are walking towards the cliff and

2041
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,880
then what do we do with those who are on

2042
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,679
the edge

2043
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,600
this is this is fantastic question

2044
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,880
because this is

2045
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,159
this is the nut of the of the problem

2046
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,880
so so do you want do you want

2047
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,760
instructionalism

2048
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,040
extended into the active inference realm

2049
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,199
or do you realize that the whatever

2050
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,040
identity you take on in terms of

2051
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,320
learning

2052
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,239
with both eyes open with some

2053
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,360
instructionalism and some interactionism

2054
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,320
i i don't know what that will be for you

2055
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,440
or blue or

2056
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,679
or me i just know it won't be an

2057
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:58,640
extension

2058
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,520
of instructionism alone i don't that's

2059
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,120
the counter factual here

2060
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,800
i don't know what that will feel like

2061
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,159
as different any more than you knew what

2062
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,840
the difference was going to be in terms

2063
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,480
of

2064
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,600
releasing to gravity as opposed to

2065
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,520
pushing against it as you were climbing

2066
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,760
up those stairs i just know that if you

2067
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,280
considered it to be

2068
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,640
just two more stairs as an extension of

2069
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,120
what you were already doing

2070
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,000
you're gonna be disappointed so i think

2071
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,719
it's that

2072
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,600
that is the that's the big question here

2073
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,040
as long as you don't

2074
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,440
as long as when i used to say to kids as

2075
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,960
long as you don't think that a field

2076
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,239
researcher

2077
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:44,880
is simply an intern outside of school

2078
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,560
i don't know what that's going to feel

2079
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,080
like and i certainly don't know what

2080
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,040
that's going to look like

2081
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,400
because i'm not out there with you and

2082
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,080
your sponsor

2083
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,840
so how can you let go of what you know

2084
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,159
in order to realize this thing that

2085
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,080
nobody can give you

2086
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,760
a direct answer to that's that's a

2087
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,360
that's a beautiful question daniel

2088
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,440
because that

2089
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,920
that for active inference is going to be

2090
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,679
the

2091
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,120
that's the rule that's going to have to

2092
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,760
be discovered that that even people who

2093
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,520
are spending a lot of time

2094
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,120
focusing on this right now giving it

2095
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,880
formalisms and and developing the

2096
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,840
the way to formalize the math are going

2097
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,280
to have to have themselves otherwise

2098
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,040
it's just going to be an extension of

2099
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,880
instructionalism and that would be sad

2100
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,600
yep it's like jumping off it's not a

2101
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,760
staircase in reverse

2102
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,960
right and um i think

2103
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,600
the idea would be maybe we already have

2104
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,280
flight suit on

2105
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,040
where it's like if you climb

2106
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,600
you climb up with the provisions and

2107
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,080
then you know when you jump

2108
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,719
you're gonna be able to do something

2109
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:57,920
that was just

2110
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,560
qualitatively different it's gonna feel

2111
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,840
different it's going to be different

2112
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,360
it's going to be a different

2113
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,400
action and

2114
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,760
wasn't the point of listening to

2115
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,520
instructions to change

2116
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,480
to update to be better or to be

2117
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,760
different

2118
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,600
and then it's like by being different

2119
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,440
and following that path

2120
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,440
we become who we are like somebody said

2121
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,560
i always wanted to be

2122
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,920
skilled in this martial art so then they

2123
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,679
trained along the way to become who they

2124
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,960
wanted to be and

2125
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,880
that was them being who they wanted to

2126
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,800
be

2127
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,000
it's a lot of sort of loose

2128
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,480
associations but again i think we're

2129
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,560
working towards making it happen

2130
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,000
it is it isn't though because

2131
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,480
instructionalism my point was that

2132
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,960
the instructions stopped i cannot give

2133
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,320
you a description

2134
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,360
of what that will look and feel like so

2135
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,960
you're going to have to interact with it

2136
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,679
that's there's not it's not a negotiable

2137
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:56,880
if you really want

2138
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,920
to be there you have to let go of the

2139
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,360
instructionalism

2140
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,560
so i don't think that's a loose

2141
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,360
association that's a non-negotiable

2142
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,080
now you may not like it and you may not

2143
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,320
go there you may step back from the edge

2144
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,040
and that's fine but don't think that i'm

2145
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,280
or other people that are actually

2146
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,520
looking at active inferences as a second

2147
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,480
eye open

2148
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,600
won't be aware of what's

2149
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,760
what you're transfiring whether you're

2150
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,960
going over

2151
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,920
or whether you're stepping back that's

2152
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,480
not a loose association that's

2153
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,280
that's pretty clear

2154
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,960
blue any thoughts on that i

2155
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,880
i guess my question would be let's just

2156
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,400
stay with this sort of like

2157
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,440
climbing the instructions to get to

2158
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,360
the space of interactions

2159
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,040
what yeah blue god so it just

2160
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,760
as like climbing the instructions to get

2161
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,679
to the space of interactions like i feel

2162
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:56,480
like

2163
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,920
something is there that is has to do

2164
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,400
with like the bottom up and the scaling

2165
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,719
like you know in the systems like we are

2166
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:05,600
climbing

2167
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,080
the instructions as you know parts of a

2168
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,920
system until we get to

2169
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,600
to that space as a system

2170
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,080
the rules well it's like okay we have

2171
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,880
the ladder

2172
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,560
going up or you know staircase going up

2173
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,640
to the jumping off point

2174
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,640
you could frame that in terms of

2175
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,760
instructions

2176
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,280
go to the second step go to the third

2177
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,360
step go to the fourth step

2178
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,159
instructionism all the way i mean our

2179
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,640
interactionism all the way it's like

2180
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,679
it gives you the rule walk forward so

2181
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,280
you can replace

2182
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,480
on a structured ascension

2183
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,280
you can replace the sequential

2184
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,960
instructions

2185
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,040
with a rule or a pattern so that it's

2186
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,920
interactionism all the way down all the

2187
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,800
way up

2188
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,400
and that kind of relates to active as a

2189
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,040
scale-free framework

2190
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,159
like bottom up from where blue

2191
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,920
are you going to start with subatomic or

2192
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,520
where is the kernel

2193
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,880
going to be and maybe just

2194
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,360
interactions all the way down and then

2195
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:11,920
at some

2196
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,239
sufficient level you can granularize or

2197
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,600
you can coarse grain you can make

2198
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,880
something look as if it has

2199
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,880
instructions so i wonder if it's like

2200
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,560
you know you see this loop right the

2201
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,239
active inference loop and it's like an

2202
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:24,719
oval

2203
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,280
like this and so i wonder if it's like

2204
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,800
starts to be like the structure of an

2205
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,199
atom

2206
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,880
like okay there's like this oval that's

2207
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,639
this way and then i wonder if i could

2208
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,920
superimpose one

2209
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,159
going the other way a vertical and a

2210
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:36,960
horizontal

2211
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,400
like a little one of these things right

2212
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,480
you know so that you know because

2213
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,080
there's this

2214
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,719
across scales as we scale up and down

2215
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:47,120
you know

2216
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,679
is there a loop going between and then a

2217
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,639
loop going

2218
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,520
this way possibly probably i don't know

2219
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,360
i think about it in that way

2220
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,320
so this could be the s orbital this is

2221
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,760
just like a spherical one and maybe

2222
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,080
there's

2223
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,440
other trajectories or flows

2224
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,480
that have different shapes

2225
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,199
so dave wrote in there and anyone else

2226
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,000
in this last

2227
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,520
little bit is welcome to write a comment

2228
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,120
dave wrote in

2229
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,080
most effective military units troops are

2230
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,520
told what to accomplish

2231
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,480
not what to do so that's the difference

2232
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,199
between

2233
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:25,199
for me like push and pull push you know

2234
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,840
lift the bar is like it's a command

2235
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,480
about

2236
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,159
what to do versus like when

2237
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,000
it's an accomplishment and so it's the

2238
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,440
teleos or the end

2239
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,560
directedness that pulls the person

2240
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,400
and then in that poll there is the space

2241
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,679
to have the solenoidal flow to

2242
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,960
to walk straight towards the goal

2243
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,840
where there's a clear path but then to

2244
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,040
be like oh yeah but then there's i'm

2245
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,000
hitting a wall

2246
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
so in order to accomplish i do have to

2247
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,120
walk around

2248
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,800
of course that makes sense in the

2249
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,199
context of being pulled by a goal

2250
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,719
but that's where the instruction-based

2251
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,320
robotics

2252
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,480
always fails because anytime there's

2253
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,320
something that requires a deviation from

2254
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,440
value

2255
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,360
you need a total second layer of the

2256
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,120
model to

2257
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,520
re-introduce curiosity or epistemic gain

2258
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,600
into the value framework so then

2259
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,960
it's this question how do you balance

2260
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,840
all these second layer bolt-ons

2261
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,920
so that you can still salvage your

2262
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,480
value-driven model

2263
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,040
even when there's aspects that are just

2264
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,000
clearly

2265
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
better framed within a pragmatic

2266
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,199
epistemic

2267
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:40,159
distinction blue yeah it's like solving

2268
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,280
the problem without

2269
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,440
ground truth data right like so how do

2270
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,880
we you know if we don't know

2271
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,880
if we've never been exposed to the

2272
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,639
system before if it's not programmed

2273
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,120
into our robotic function you know how

2274
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,719
do we um

2275
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,639
account for that right so i think that

2276
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,080
that's where the exploration and the

2277
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,199
play

2278
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,840
a lot comes in or maybe tossing and

2279
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,480
turning

2280
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,280
like you want to be comfortable and then

2281
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,600
it just sort of uncoordinated

2282
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,320
behavior that's just rummaging around

2283
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,000
searching for something in a box or all

2284
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,679
these examples where

2285
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,560
it's so you couldn't say that that twist

2286
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,440
of your side

2287
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,639
it was it's not skillful at least for me

2288
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,360
but it's also not reward driven again

2289
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,400
you need a way

2290
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,360
second level bolt-on to be explaining

2291
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,520
how the rummaging behavior

2292
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,320
is itself value-driven you can say that

2293
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,159
there is a value that's pulling

2294
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,080
or you want the valuable thing in that

2295
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,280
box

2296
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,199
but that's we all agree on that we all

2297
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,560
agree that there's something valuable in

2298
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,000
the box and that search behavior is

2299
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,760
going to be required

2300
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,920
are we going to have a process theory

2301
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,239
that allows for exploration

2302
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,840
and then zeroing in on a goal or

2303
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,400
will we have a process theory that tries

2304
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,679
to go like well if the end

2305
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:56,080
is valuable then let's just back

2306
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,960
propagate value

2307
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,199
yeah or we don't know if we don't know

2308
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,719
what's valuable in the box

2309
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,800
right something is valuable in here like

2310
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,320
how do we find out what is it that's

2311
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,080
valuable okay so we implement the search

2312
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,639
function

2313
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,480
but then exploring what is the valuable

2314
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,560
item out of you know 50 items in the box

2315
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,560
right

2316
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,199
yep it's almost like in the simplest

2317
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,719
cases

2318
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,920
uh the value learning is defensible

2319
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,480
when we have this hill-climbing robot on

2320
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,840
a single hill

2321
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,600
okay but now you got a triple bottom

2322
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,239
line you got the financial success

2323
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,480
but you also have environmental and

2324
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,120
social considerations of a business

2325
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,880
so will you reduce all three of them

2326
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,760
to one of them or try to generate a

2327
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,400
fourth

2328
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,159
standard that you're going to reduce

2329
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,920
them all like a common currency for all

2330
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,719
of your values and rewards

2331
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,400
or could there be a deep generative

2332
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,840
model where

2333
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
the organization has preferences in the

2334
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,480
financial social and environmental realm

2335
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
and then take stock of its action

2336
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,400
possibilities not even described in the

2337
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,760
value mindset

2338
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,280
maybe every time you have a meeting it's

2339
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,040
like square zero what can we do

2340
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,760
whereas in active inference we start

2341
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,800
with the space of

2342
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,120
policies the affordances that the niche

2343
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,159
provides

2344
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,800
and so you don't need to consider

2345
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,960
policies that cannot be done

2346
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,280
and you should re-weight policies

2347
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,719
accordingly to

2348
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,440
how likely or tractable they are so

2349
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,560
there's just

2350
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,440
so many ways that we see that the

2351
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,520
mathematical framings

2352
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:34,239
get expanded on through uh relaxation

2353
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,400
of some of their attributes just like

2354
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,080
first in 2011

2355
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,400
wrote which is that optimal control can

2356
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,760
be cached as active inference

2357
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,440
with three simplifications

2358
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,719
and then he walked through those which

2359
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,560
we discussed a little bit last time but

2360
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,760
this is kind of

2361
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,960
cool how we're building out some

2362
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,760
differences between the motor control

2363
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,199
approaches that have been used in the

2364
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,199
past and

2365
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,440
active inference as a process theory and

2366
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,199
then the way that

2367
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,320
that encompasses what we've seen before

2368
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,960
and then maybe also opens up the

2369
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,800
discussion

2370
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,880
into just areas that weren't even

2371
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,080
considered like we can add in

2372
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
affordances

2373
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,960
plus preferences

2374
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,639
that i think that embodied skillful and

2375
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,320
an active inference implies

2376
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,679
a huge leap of faith back to that uh

2377
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,239
jumping off the because it is i mean

2378
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:34,880
that's not

2379
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,000
that's a that's a cliche that people can

2380
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,239
probably appreciate

2381
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,480
what do you think the trust or faith is

2382
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,360
in

2383
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,719
yeah that's it yourself

2384
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,679
yourself right or through it

2385
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,920
act or act not there is no infer

2386
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,760
no there is there is um

2387
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,239
so it's interesting yeah how how can we

2388
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:08,320
distill the similarities and differences

2389
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,560
so that when we see one of those

2390
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,400
limitations

2391
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,880
being like okay we had um uh curiosity

2392
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,360
slash pragmatic plus epistemic

2393
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,560
so that when we see a sort of here's the

2394
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,840
new hack

2395
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,600
on value we can see that

2396
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,120
as a saddle point for where

2397
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,520
that model could move towards an active

2398
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,239
inference

2399
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,440
framing just by kind of rewiring

2400
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,639
some of the modules that it has

2401
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,159
um here's a

2402
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,639
great question from the live chat bill

2403
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:49,840
wrote

2404
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,120
would a priority parameter according to

2405
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,199
depletion levels of different resources

2406
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,360
be

2407
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,719
applicable

2408
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,400
yeah that's back to the pools thing yeah

2409
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,199
i would say yes

2410
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,440
okay dean with the pools here would be

2411
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,920
my uh thought from the multi-scale

2412
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,719
decision making let's just think about a

2413
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,239
bee colony

2414
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,239
the resources that they need to forage

2415
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,280
for include

2416
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,440
like pollen which has a lot of protein

2417
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,320
and fat

2418
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,760
and it's helpful for the developing

2419
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,000
larva then nectar

2420
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,960
which is like high octane gasoline a lot

2421
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,960
of carbs good for the adults

2422
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,719
um and then depending on the environment

2423
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,639
they might need like water or salt or

2424
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:35,440
other

2425
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,679
different resources so the depletion

2426
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,639
of uh there might be an imbalance of the

2427
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:43,440
nutrients

2428
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,960
and you can think about that similarly

2429
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,880
for an organism like

2430
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,120
rabbit starvation when you only eat

2431
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:49,920
protein

2432
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,840
your body will enter starvation mode

2433
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,040
because you know other

2434
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,920
fats and stuff are needed so definitely

2435
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,280
multiple resources

2436
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,960
are being balanced and part of the

2437
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,880
challenge of decision making under

2438
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,320
uncertainty

2439
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,679
just as we've been getting at is that

2440
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:06,080
there's not just one kind of outcome

2441
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,000
like it's enough to be uncertain about

2442
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
value but now when we're

2443
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,159
thinking about these multi-dimensional

2444
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,320
resource landscapes

2445
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,000
whether it's just protein versus carbs

2446
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,520
or whether it's a lot more nuanced like

2447
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,199
the triple bottom line

2448
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:22,560
we really do need a principled way

2449
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,440
of talking about the relative depletion

2450
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,000
of

2451
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,760
different uh resources so

2452
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,280
in the bee colony case selection

2453
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,719
has shaped nest mates so that

2454
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,639
they use the rate and the type of

2455
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,400
interactions they have

2456
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,400
in order to update their nest mate level

2457
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,159
behavior so i'm having a lot of

2458
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,159
interactions with hungry larva

2459
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,480
maybe we need more pollen i'm having a

2460
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,920
lot of interactions with

2461
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,920
food reservoirs maybe that can slow me

2462
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,000
down because we probably have enough

2463
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,520
forage for now so colonies that don't

2464
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,000
consist

2465
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,480
of nest mates with that productive way

2466
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,560
of interpreting their interactions

2467
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,120
not instructions those colonies are

2468
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,320
swept off the table

2469
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,400
and so we end up seeing distributed

2470
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,000
systems succeed

2471
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,440
where they act as if there is a correct

2472
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,639
prioritization

2473
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,679
amidst uncertainty of different kinds of

2474
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,280
resources

2475
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,440
and then if we use active inference

2476
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,800
instrumentally

2477
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,280
in the deep generative model of the

2478
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,920
body's

2479
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,880
nutrient ratios or the colonies relative

2480
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,320
balance between protein and

2481
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,080
carbs then it's as if

2482
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,280
there is a priority parameter where

2483
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,760
when something is depleted it's the one

2484
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,120
that's prioritized

2485
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,600
but we don't need that expressively in

2486
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,040
the model

2487
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,560
we can have a multi-dimensional um

2488
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,679
generative model of different resources

2489
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,199
and then actions will be selected

2490
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,520
according to their expected free energy

2491
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,280
being minimized

2492
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,400
almost going along the curve that takes

2493
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,080
us on that edge of

2494
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,280
explore and exploit from wherever we are

2495
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,520
in that resource depletion landscape

2496
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,920
towards our preferences

2497
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,440
so would be totally open to hearing

2498
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,400
other explanations or maybe there is a

2499
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,000
priority parameter that can come into

2500
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,880
play

2501
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,719
but one sort of longitud response

2502
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,239
would be organisms do act adaptively to

2503
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,960
prioritize depleted resources

2504
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,400
but that doesn't mean that there needs

2505
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,239
to be a parameter in our model

2506
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,400
that explicitly prioritizes specific

2507
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,320
resources it's enough just to have a

2508
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,440
preference vector

2509
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,719
that includes multiple types of

2510
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,080
resources blue

2511
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,159
no i think that that's right i think the

2512
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,239
um

2513
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,719
right so you can make it as simple or

2514
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:51,679
complicated

2515
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,280
as you want but i always think less

2516
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:59,840
parameters in the model is better

2517
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,239
it just makes me think you know how do

2518
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:05,040
we get those preferences

2519
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,120
and then what happens when the niche

2520
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,159
changes

2521
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,120
so that preferences that were adaptive

2522
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,320
like to

2523
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,400
act as if prioritization of sugar and

2524
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,000
salt over all other

2525
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,040
preferences for example what happens

2526
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,000
when

2527
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,600
the situation changes so how do we

2528
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,920
integrate high precision priors

2529
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,040
with highly accurate sensory input

2530
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,159
that's something we've talked about

2531
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,760
before how do we get the best of both

2532
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,880
worlds

2533
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,679
with being able to like fly blind

2534
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:39,840
because we have a deep generative model

2535
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,880
but then also

2536
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,480
when there is sensory input that

2537
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,600
requires a categorical shift

2538
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,880
in cognitive model for example we want

2539
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,440
to

2540
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,320
have the fluidity to do that and we

2541
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,440
don't want to

2542
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,480
be wasting our time in one mode

2543
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,600
when it's the wrong mode we don't want

2544
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,800
to

2545
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,440
be hard when hardness is a flaw or be

2546
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,000
soft when

2547
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,440
softness is a flaw so i wonder if

2548
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,159
there's like

2549
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:11,760
um you know i mean for organisms like

2550
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,920
bees and birds like there's some

2551
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,440
programmed i mean things are shifting

2552
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,360
all the time right like there's

2553
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,760
you know a huge amount of like migratory

2554
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,120
stuff that comes into play and

2555
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,400
hibernating and

2556
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,440
all these things right um and so like

2557
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,040
for us like we

2558
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,239
noticed that prioritized like

2559
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,520
shift like i need water right now

2560
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,440
like you know if we're suddenly like

2561
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,120
parched right like the need for water is

2562
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,080
overwhelming

2563
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,560
but there's not this like because we

2564
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,199
have offloaded so much of our

2565
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,280
needs into our niche like the need for

2566
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,199
to stay warm or whatever we build houses

2567
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,080
we wear clothes

2568
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,679
so we've offloaded a lot of this stuff

2569
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,880
so i i wonder if it's like um

2570
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,560
the instinct becomes less instinctual

2571
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,320
i wonder if that's if that happens like

2572
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,400
the instinct for to

2573
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,239
sequester food or fly south for the

2574
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,320
winter or these types of things

2575
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,520
um just because you know we don't um

2576
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,360
we don't we've just offloaded our need

2577
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,520
to do those things so it just becomes

2578
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,960
i don't know there

2579
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,679
i think that's another uh distinction

2580
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:18,400
here

2581
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,520
here we can include extended slash

2582
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,239
embedded you know four e's seventies

2583
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,000
eleven e's however many there are

2584
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,520
um we can at least frame those

2585
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,280
situations in terms of niche

2586
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,199
modification or niche construction where

2587
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,159
is that

2588
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,880
in motor control it's nowhere where is

2589
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,280
the

2590
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,159
golf club with a squishy handle that is

2591
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:40,800
being

2592
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,719
you know interacted with as an

2593
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,840
instrument

2594
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,880
we don't have those nice interfaces

2595
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,360
whereas active inference has excellent

2596
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,239
interfaces

2597
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,560
quantitatively and qualitatively for

2598
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,760
being enriched

2599
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,679
by pieces that are as dean would say

2600
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,199
maybe non-negotiable

2601
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,840
for the actual creature but it'd be

2602
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,600
totally ad-hoc where would you put

2603
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,600
the instrumentation in here is it a

2604
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,360
state estimator should i be estimating

2605
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,639
where my golf club is

2606
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,320
or is it enough just to estimate my

2607
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,000
hands and the angle of the hands and

2608
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,880
then do another

2609
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,520
second level prediction not quite clear

2610
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,400
you could probably

2611
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,960
implement it multiple ways and here's

2612
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,840
another nice

2613
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,880
comment from dave so dave said the term

2614
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,000
in cybernetics

2615
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,600
so it's always good to connect back to

2616
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,600
related areas

2617
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,159
or putting drives into a model is

2618
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:29,360
algodonic

2619
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,840
so here's the definition of algodonic

2620
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,960
comes from

2621
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,520
i guess algos meaning pain and hedon

2622
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,719
meaning pleasure

2623
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:40,080
sorry dave for the mispronunciation um

2624
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,000
putting multiple algodonic drives like

2625
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,679
pains and pleasures may yield

2626
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,480
complex instructive behaviors but there

2627
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,800
are so many advantages in having a model

2628
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,080
i think active inference so

2629
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,400
sophisticated that it generates its

2630
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,280
drives

2631
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,520
the drives come out of the model rather

2632
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,679
than being put in

2633
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,639
so yes and he wrote then clarifying i

2634
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:01,920
mean the innumerable

2635
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,840
drives emerge from the model's internal

2636
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,119
dynamics

2637
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,440
if your robot is spontaneously curious

2638
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,199
spontaneously attends to events or

2639
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,639
responsive externals

2640
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,679
it's as if it has a curiosity parameter

2641
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,520
so it's true maybe we could even write

2642
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,880
like drives

2643
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,320
quote you know as if

2644
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,159
i'm gonna i'm gonna take shakespeare

2645
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,639
thanks hamlet you are great

2646
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,719
a great prince um drives

2647
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,719
drives emerge from model

2648
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:38,480
um don't need to be put in so

2649
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,719
instead of uh like maybe the rapid being

2650
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:41,840
put in the hat

2651
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,440
this is like the rabbits emerge from the

2652
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:45,840
hat

2653
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,760
if you you know put in enough hydrogen

2654
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,239
and enough time

2655
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:53,520
so that's interesting to think about

2656
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,960
where cybernetic models

2657
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,159
come into play here so let's give just

2658
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,560
a few final minutes all right any final

2659
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,199
questions

2660
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:05,199
in the chat and thanks of course to

2661
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:09,839
dave and to phil for the great questions

2662
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
we can just think about um maybe dot one

2663
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,440
dean is um being on the edge

2664
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:22,800
dot zero is climbing

2665
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,040
and so it's a two directional trail you

2666
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,239
know there's people going up to half

2667
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:27,920
dome and there's people coming down

2668
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,600
so dot zero is two directional

2669
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,480
highway lots of on-ramps and off-ramps

2670
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,280
but we

2671
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,159
try to make the topics accessible for

2672
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,360
those who are

2673
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,360
not in the active inference game but

2674
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,280
they're related they're familiar with

2675
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,080
related topics like the keywords usually

2676
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,840
and in the dot zero we're going to go

2677
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,119
from bridging

2678
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,280
the keywords and the topics of broader

2679
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,119
concern to active inference

2680
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:54,960
so that's the on-ramp to active

2681
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,199
inference but then also for those who

2682
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:58,239
are

2683
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,760
already in the active inference mode of

2684
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,679
learning by doing and working then

2685
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,639
it's their window out to like oh wow you

2686
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,320
know this idea that i had been working

2687
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:10,880
on

2688
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,639
active inference in one context it's

2689
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,000
also applying outwards

2690
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,719
so that's in the dot zero dot one you

2691
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:17,280
know

2692
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,400
who whoever and whenever it is

2693
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,760
uh we are in the the bathtub face the

2694
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,199
part between the book ends

2695
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,480
that's we're at the edge and we can

2696
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,639
look back to the dot zero and see

2697
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,880
again recapping the the steps that we

2698
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,159
took

2699
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:39,840
but also we want to start looking

2700
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,880
out and then i don't know where dot two

2701
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,320
would be but dot two is when we sort of

2702
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,560
take the next step and

2703
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,119
the dot two is the no going back i mean

2704
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:54,880
i

2705
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,960
i can add a twist to the fact that i'm

2706
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,360
i'm going to be hitting the water soon

2707
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,360
and that's a skillful embodied movement

2708
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,679
right we actually watch people that

2709
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,400
do the 10 meter platform and can add up

2710
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,639
quite a few things before they

2711
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,239
hit the water and regain control but i

2712
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:15,600
i i i think this is this

2713
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,800
is what interactionism is versus

2714
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,960
instructionalism

2715
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,800
i mean the way that this is set up the

2716
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,480
zero one two

2717
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,760
is interactionism it's more about this

2718
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,600
than it is about um bi-directionality

2719
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,800
and i think you talked about that at the

2720
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,400
beginning of today's

2721
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:38,000
episode right we have a

2722
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,119
a structure that we hold to a rail

2723
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:44,000
that we could modify as well but we hold

2724
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
to the rail

2725
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,000
so that we don't have to frame it like

2726
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,760
instructions

2727
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,480
um we weren't instructed to do this and

2728
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,040
i don't know

2729
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,719
i hope that people don't feel like these

2730
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,480
are instructions but

2731
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,320
rather interactions or engagements with

2732
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,400
them and then just like so many other

2733
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,560
things that we're seeing online

2734
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,920
the new technological affordances allow

2735
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,639
it to actually be an interaction we

2736
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:09,119
actually

2737
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,280
can have people asking questions live

2738
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,719
being a part of the conversation whereas

2739
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,239
if it were just recording a video and

2740
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:20,239
releasing it or record

2741
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,960
making a book and releasing it it'd be

2742
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,960
hard to break out of the instructionist

2743
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,520
frame

2744
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,560
because the deliverable would be static

2745
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,080
and very unidirectional here

2746
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,280
we have a different affordance that

2747
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,880
helps us break out of that frame

2748
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,639
basically for free

2749
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,719
because even if instructions are being

2750
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:41,920
conveyed on the live stream

2751
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,760
it would still be within an interaction

2752
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,480
of participants of individual and

2753
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,360
collective

2754
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,560
and of the community so

2755
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,000
any final thoughts

2756
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,199
on one no fun times thanks both of you

2757
01:40:59,199 --> 01:40:59,679
for the

2758
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,600
the dot zero and dot one fun we've had

2759
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,679
a few hours to think about it but you

2760
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:06,960
know the paper

2761
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,960
is the distillation of many more hours

2762
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,800
so there's always

2763
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,880
value dare i say and

2764
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,280
going back and playing with it because

2765
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,639
it's fun

2766
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,440
and it's just yep there are great topics

2767
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,600
to be considering about and learning

2768
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,480
so cool thanks everyone for watching

2769
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,760
thanks dean and blue

2770
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,520
and we'll see you next week for 23.2

2771
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:40,000
thanks guys bye
