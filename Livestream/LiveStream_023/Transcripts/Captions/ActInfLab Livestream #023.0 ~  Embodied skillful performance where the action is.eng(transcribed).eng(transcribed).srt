welcome everybody thank you for joining

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,799
us live or in replay

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,960
this is actin flab live stream number

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,439
23.0

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,720
it's may 27th 2021 and we're going to be

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
talking about the paper

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,279
embodied skillful performance and i'm

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:27,840
daniel

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
i'm here with blue and dean so

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
thanks for joining you too

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,440
welcome everybody to the actonflab we're

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
a participatory online lab

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,440
that is communicating learning and

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,399
practicing

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
applied active inference you can find us

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
at the links that we have laid out here

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
this is recorded in an archived live

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
stream so please provide us with

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
feedback so that we can improve our work

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
all backgrounds and perspectives are

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,440
welcome to contribute here

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
and as far as video etiquette for live

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
streams we'll be doing our best

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
we're heading into june so soon in just

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
a few weeks

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,360
and we'll be having discussion number

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,680
23.1

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,640
and dot 2 on this paper so today it's

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,360
going to be about

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,520
background and context and then we're

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
looking forward on june 8th

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
and 15th 2021 to be talking about this

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,960
in a group setting so as stated

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,560
the goal of this 23.0 is to set the

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,360
context

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
for the upcoming 1 and 2 videos

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,600
we're going to be discussing the paper

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,759
embodied skillful performance

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
where the action is which is a

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
collaboration of hippolyto baltierri

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
fristen and ramstead

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
and just like the other dot zeros it's

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
an introduction and a first pass to some

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,479
of these ideas it's not

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,520
a review or a final word

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
we're going to go over the aims and

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
claims

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
the abstract roadmap and then kind of

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,560
walk through the figures plus a few of

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
these ideas because there are a lot of

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
cool ideas

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,719
and it's an embodied paper it's about

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
our movement and our behavior

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
in the world so hopefully that will lead

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
all of us to have some

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
fun ideas about what it means and where

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
it applies

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
and of course we're looking forward to

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
the dot one and dot two discussions

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,680
so you can write any questions during

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
this stream in the live chat or you can

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,640
write a comment

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
or find a way to get that question to us

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
otherwise and get in touch if you want

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
to participate

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
so to slide six

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
we're checking out this paper embodied

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,239
skillful performance

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
where the action is and before we get to

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
the aims and claims

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
maybe each of you any just top of the

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,360
head

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
thoughts what made you excited or

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
curious about this paper

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
i don't want to talk too much about this

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,519
because it was a great paper but

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
i again could go off into the wilderness

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,519
very

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,680
rapidly so i want to just kind of stick

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
to what the

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
what the basics of the paper are and

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,519
we'll worry about other ideas in

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
point one and point two for me sounds

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,560
great

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
thanks for that contribution blue i've

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
been just thinking a lot about um

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
you know related to this paper and other

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
work i'm involved in right now like how

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,480
beliefs and desires and intentions map

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,519
to action

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
so it was really kind of cool to see

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
this perspective

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
nice um so maybe blue

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
want to start with a aim of the paper

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
or i'll read it or sorry i was needed

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
this is the aim of this paper is to

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
discuss critically the limitations of

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
instructionist control theoretic models

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,000
of

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
skill for skillful performance so

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
that's the overall aim yep nice that

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,239
they said it

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
so clearly so that's what they're trying

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
to do they're bringing up

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
what's the instructionist control theory

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
model of skillful performance which

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,120
we're gonna

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
cover the background on and then they're

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,879
going to

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,200
show that that instructionist assumption

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
in its strong and weak form

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
is imbued in the optimal motor control

114
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,320
theory or omct

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
framework and then coming in to save the

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,639
day

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
active inference is going to be proposed

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,479
as an alternative

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,199
framework for understanding skillful

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,560
performance

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,479
and they then conclude by suggesting

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
that if we understand these generative

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,600
models

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
within active inference as formal tools

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
then we may be able to have an account

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
of skilled performance

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,120
that's based upon interactions rather

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
than instructions

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
so that's kind of cool because

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,840
instructions

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
are how computers work and education is

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,120
also

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
sometimes framed as being about

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
instruction rather than interaction

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
so here is the abstract and then either

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
of you are welcome to add a thought or

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
it stands alone when someone masters a

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
skill their performance looks to us

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
like second nature it looks as if their

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
actions are smoothly performed without

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
explicit

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
knowledge driven online monitoring of

143
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
their performance

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
contemporary computational models in

145
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
motor control theory however

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
are instructionist that is they cast

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
skillful performance as a knowledge

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
driven process

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
optimal motor control theory omct

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,080
as representative par excellence of such

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,039
approaches

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
casts skillful performance as an

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,080
instruction

154
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
instantiated in the brain that needs to

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
be executed

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
a motor command this paper aims to show

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
the limitations of such instructionist

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,680
approaches to skillful

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
performance we specifically address the

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,199
question of whether

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
the assumption of control theoretic

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
models is warranted

163
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
then they lay out the three sections or

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
four sections of the paper

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
the first section of this paper examines

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
the instructionist assumption

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
according to which skillful performance

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
consists of the execution of theoretical

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,800
instructions harnessed in motor

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
representations

171
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
the second and third sections

172
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
characterize the implementation

173
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
of motor representations as motor

174
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
commands with a special focus on the

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,800
formulations from

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
omct the final sections of this paper

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
examine predictive coding and active

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
inference behavioral modeling frameworks

179
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,440
that descend

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
but are distinct from omct and argued

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
that the instructionist control

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
theoretic assumptions are ill-motivated

183
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
in light of new developments in active

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,919
inference

185
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,198
any thoughts on that

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,240
yep dean so i think i think that that

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
that there is a place for command and

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
control but it's not the

189
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,479
only place or the sort of all-in

190
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
all embracing place and i think that's

191
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,599
what the paper

192
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,639
sets out to try to show yes they don't

193
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,520
say

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
um there is no such thing as

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
um instruction they just suggest

196
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
that for talking about motor control and

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,479
for skilled performance especially maybe

198
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,680
there's a better way to frame it the

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,479
roadmap

200
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
is shown here so it starts with an

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
introduction

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
section they then introduce their um

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
whipping horse the scapegoat the

204
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,599
instructionist model

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
of skillful performance and discuss how

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
motor representations are playing the

207
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
role essentially of motor commands

208
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
in a sort of brain instructing the body

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,960
model

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,919
of motor behavior they talk about how

211
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,440
motor commands

212
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
are representational and we'll talk a

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
little bit about representations

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
as well and then connect the ideas

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
of motor commands and instructionism to

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
optimal control theory so basically

217
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
saying in order to achieve that kind of

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
optimal or even adequate control

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,520
instructions are being sent to the motor

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,319
department

221
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
of the university from a non-motor

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
department

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
like the nervous system in section 6

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,240
less control more action they try to

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
move the discussion from simply optimal

226
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,919
control

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
to a broader consideration of the

228
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,879
dynamics of biological systems

229
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
framed generally as in the case of

230
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
predictive coding and active inference

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
and then in section seven they discuss

232
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
how motor control

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
um again building up this argument that

234
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
it's about interactions

235
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
not just instructions they frame motor

236
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
control as being

237
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
a mode of sensory motor engagement with

238
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,320
the world

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
and even that word sensory motor kind of

240
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
suggests that there's going to be a

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
non-duality between

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
sense and action which brings us of

243
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
course to active inference

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,120
and the conclusion and also then after

245
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
the conclusion there's a box

246
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
where they define active inference and

247
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
free energy and some other

248
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
terms so that's the um roadmap

249
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
any thoughts on the roadmap or we'll

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
just keep on going

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
nice okay the keywords were laid out

252
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
by the authors skillful performance it's

253
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,560
right there in the title

254
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
so not too surprising that it's a

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
keyword they also talk about

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
optimal control theory instructionism

257
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
motor representation action-oriented

258
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,240
representations

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,279
and our favorite active inference so

260
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
we're going to

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,320
now meander through these keywords

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
and define it try to use the author's

263
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
own words to see how they

264
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,959
framed the keyword and then also just

265
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,839
because

266
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
we're having fun here in this trio we

267
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
took it in a few different ways and

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
brought up some related ideas and so i

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
think this will be a fun walk

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
through so i'll read the author's

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
definition of skillful performance and

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
then both of you please

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
um so skillful performance in the paper

274
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,720
is defined as as opposed to bare

275
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,279
movements

276
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,839
such as breathing and blinking skillful

277
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,640
performances

278
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
are intelligent bodily activities which

279
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
harness knowledge about how to perform

280
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
certain movements expertly and just to

281
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
describe some of the expert movements

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
that we see on this slide

283
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,560
we have a basketball a sports ball being

284
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,120
played

285
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
with a free throw we have a pilot this

286
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
is kind of an extended

287
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,519
skillful performance involving a flight

288
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
deck in a in the cockpit

289
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,640
we have various styles of dance and

290
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
performance and martial arts

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
and interaction whether um touching

292
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
somebody or not touching somebody

293
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
these are all skillful activities that

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
people can train their entire life

295
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
to enable um the performance of so

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
either of you i'm sure you can jump in

297
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,399
on this um

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,680
key term so blue first

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
yeah i'll jump in you know i thought

300
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
like

301
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
of course these are all very physical

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
and like sensory motor but there's also

303
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
i mean i guess

304
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
all things are but like music i think

305
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
was brought up in the paper that's not

306
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,320
here

307
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
um and i think about stuff i've done

308
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
like you know and think about like

309
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
surgery right like like what a surgeon

310
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,680
does like they go that is a skillful

311
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,480
performance

312
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,000
it might not be in front of others but

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
like you have to just kind of know and

314
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,959
like guided by your kinesthetic memory

315
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
like any kind of aseptic technique lab

316
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
work i'm sure you've done some wet lab

317
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
work daniel like where it's like you

318
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
come in and it's like you just have to

319
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,120
flow through it yeah pipetting yep

320
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
they have robots for that now and that's

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,480
the joke how do you know someone's a

322
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
biologist

323
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
they can take the cap of the toothpaste

324
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
off and put it back on with one hand

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
that's what we do with bottles of

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
reagents so that

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
and it takes so much time like

328
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
to think about it like at first and then

329
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
you just do it without thinking about it

330
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
like it's it's

331
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
so there's this ironic like where you're

332
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
consciously like

333
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,000
trying to do it with one hand and not

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
touch the other thing and then

335
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,279
like after you do it for so many years

336
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
it just becomes second nature

337
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
dean yeah i just it was interesting to

338
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
me because i don't know when

339
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
when the the lines crossed and you go

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
from an autonomic

341
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
habituated response the part about

342
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,440
blinking

343
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
the ones that i don't think about versus

344
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,519
the ones when my

345
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,800
my spouse she looks at me and i wasn't

346
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
aware of it in the past but she was

347
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
using those blinks

348
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
in a certain way and was very effective

349
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,720
i i

350
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
went right over my head but she was

351
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
sending a signal and it worked

352
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
so is it i again it can come down

353
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,639
even to it can come to thinking and not

354
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,320
thinking about it and it can also come

355
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,880
to

356
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,240
sometimes what we notice and don't

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
notice

358
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
i agree and not to um generalize

359
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
too rapidly but perhaps active inference

360
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,360
can describe

361
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
the entire continuum of performance and

362
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
so we're almost dismantling this idea of

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
skilled performance because that

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,519
makes it sound like there's going to be

365
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,440
a distinction between skilled and

366
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
unskilled

367
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
whereas walking is a skill and there's

368
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,600
so many different

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
capacities and constraints and ways that

370
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
the body adapts to

371
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
itself and its needs so it's something

372
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
that you can learn and

373
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
anyone who's had a physical injury or

374
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,959
needs to go to physical therapy

375
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
it's relearning as well so i think it's

376
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,399
a big

377
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,639
way to talk about motor behavior but

378
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,680
it's almost like saying

379
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
if we can clear this high bar if we can

380
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,920
have an active inference account

381
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
that is playing piano or doing martial

382
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
arts then

383
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
surely we can have one that is more at a

384
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,360
unskilled level but it's still a skill

385
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,360
okay nice so then i'll play the video i

386
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,160
don't think you'll

387
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
see it but i'm playing the video in the

388
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
background of ilon

389
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,639
a plant hybrid hybrid uh plant robot

390
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
hybrid and this is from the mit

391
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
media lab so blue what made you want to

392
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
put this video here while it's playing

393
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
uh so i just kept thinking like they

394
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
kept using the the terminology motor

395
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,519
plant

396
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
and having seen this video like i was

397
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,880
like oh

398
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
motor plant that reminds me of this

399
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
motor

400
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
or plant that's attached to a motor uh

401
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,040
um

402
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
and the you know mechanisms that are

403
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
used for uh

404
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,600
motion in in the plant um which is is

405
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,399
awesome

406
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,079
so i just i don't know wanted to put it

407
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
in there and just see if

408
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,519
maybe our active inference active in for

409
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,800
plants applies

410
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
across you know all domains of life

411
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,600
yep very nice so it's kind of like we

412
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
know that active inference is a

413
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,839
scale-free

414
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,839
framework but also it sort of doesn't

415
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,959
have a

416
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
human-centered frame either so this is a

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
plant that in the video you can see

418
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
it's using its signaling processes

419
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
to react to stimuli and move back and

420
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,199
forth between these two

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,079
lights so it's having it's kind of like

422
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,800
a

423
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
a person in a um mobility device

424
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
you're giving it a new affordance by

425
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
modifying its niche

426
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
and so just like we're rethinking

427
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
skilled versus unskilled we're also

428
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,839
maybe

429
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
rethinking who gets to have behavior

430
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
and that made me think of a paper

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
from 1989 by my phd advisor deborah

432
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,120
gordon

433
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
and a collaborator silverton where they

434
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,639
laid out a framework for plant behavior

435
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,480
and they just plainly wrote out here we

436
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
use the term behavior

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
to mean what a plant or animal does in

438
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
the course of an individual's lifetime

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,399
in response to some event or change in

440
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,600
its environment

441
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
so it's like it's what things do you

442
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
know just do it

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
that's behavior and that's kind of how

444
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
action is in active inference

445
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
whether your active state is you can

446
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
only move one finger

447
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
or you can move all your fingers those

448
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
are your active state affordances

449
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
so we want to have a framework that is

450
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
able to accommodate

451
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
differences in individuals or even

452
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
species in how they

453
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
behave one thing daniel i think that the

454
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
the we the adding of the wheels and

455
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
you've hear you've heard that you you

456
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,079
well cliche the game it's a game changer

457
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
but essentially the rules changed in

458
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,360
that video

459
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
and that's and that's when the rules

460
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
change the behaviors can modify

461
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,519
and i think that's one of the things

462
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,079
that comes out in this paper later on if

463
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,759
we want to include that

464
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
we want to sort of inflate it up to that

465
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,440
level

466
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,920
nice and the skillful performance of

467
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,279
music you know if somebody is really

468
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,920
good at like

469
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
drumming on their own body or using

470
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
their voice box or beat boxing like

471
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
those are all sort of

472
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
on-board tools and affordances that we

473
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,480
have

474
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
people can clap really well and do all

475
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,839
sorts of stuff like that but

476
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,920
once you start talking about physical

477
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
instrumentation

478
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
whether it's a spoon or a violin or drum

479
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
set you're talking about

480
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,519
kind of modifying your niche and being

481
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
able to undertake skill performance

482
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
with your new tools so

483
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,799
again extended embedded and cultured

484
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,000
cognition the four

485
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,880
e's active inference it's right there

486
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
and that's why we want to think broadly

487
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
about skilled performance here and you

488
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,240
know invite

489
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,359
into this conversation whether a

490
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,400
technical

491
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
minded person or somebody who considers

492
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
some of their own behaviors to be

493
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
skilled performances how does this

494
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,199
remark on them

495
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
it brings us to what the authors call

496
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
the paradox

497
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
of skillful performance so they write

498
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,440
here's the paradox a seemingly

499
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
paradoxical relationship between action

500
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,799
and knowledge

501
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
action both requires knowledge and is

502
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
inhibited by knowledge

503
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,600
skillful performance involves both an

504
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
exquisite sensitivity

505
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
to cultural norms and situational

506
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
context but also

507
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
kind of requires us to put that aside at

508
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
least consciously

509
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,640
while it's happening how then to make

510
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
sense of the relation

511
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,160
between knowledge and skillful

512
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
performance

513
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
surely knowledge is involved in skillful

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
performance but

515
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
is it entirely in the form of a theory

516
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
that ought to be executed as a top-down

517
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
instruction

518
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,679
anything to add on this paradox

519
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
um i think that you can have

520
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
thinking is doing and then you can have

521
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
doing is doing and i think this is

522
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
talking to some of the ideas around the

523
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
quieting of the mind piece so instead of

524
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
always having

525
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
these commands coming through you don't

526
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
have to think about it so much anymore

527
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,880
so yeah i like the

528
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
idea that um you know knowledge is

529
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,480
it inhibits so it requires action

530
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
requires knowledge but it's also

531
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
inhibited by it like

532
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
if you're it like lends itself to the

533
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
kind of overthinking

534
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,320
process right like you're overthinking

535
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
it you're never going to get it it's

536
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,720
like um

537
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
i think someone was just speaking on

538
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,240
tuesday about like holding the butterfly

539
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,360
was it stephen

540
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
you know like it's like when you grip an

541
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
idea like i want to

542
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,039
ride a bicycle or play the piano you

543
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,160
have to hold it

544
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,679
and like let it rest on your hand but

545
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,360
don't like squeeze it or you'll you'll

546
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
kill the butterfly

547
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
and that kind of like reminds me of this

548
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
knowledge like if you're overthinking

549
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
the process of playing the piano like

550
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
you're going to get it all wrong

551
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,679
yep if you grab the handlebar too tight

552
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,080
or grab your dance partner too tight

553
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
and then when you take it into the area

554
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,320
like post poetry

555
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
recitation or playing a classical music

556
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,320
piece

557
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
are they thinking about the sheet music

558
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679
is their internal

559
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
representation or knowledge what is

560
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
enabling that performance

561
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
that's kind of what we're going to be

562
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
exploring so they motivate

563
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,000
that paradox as being something that has

564
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
to be explained why do people choke

565
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
when they think too much about their

566
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,919
golf swing or their tennis swing

567
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
and we'll come back to flow and thinking

568
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
about that later on

569
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
there has to be like this correct

570
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
relational distance

571
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,280
from the task that you're trying to to

572
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,840
perform

573
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,159
and i think that that is you know

574
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,200
embodied by this

575
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
sentence and action requires requires

576
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
knowledge and is inhibited by it

577
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,400
you have to be the right distance away

578
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,679
from it like if you're too close it

579
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,880
doesn't make sense and if you're too far

580
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,799
away it doesn't make sense

581
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
yep cool yeah i don't want to add one

582
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
other thing like yesterday i was walking

583
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
in the park and there's three kids that

584
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,039
were zooming down the hill on their

585
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,080
scooters

586
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,960
and the first kid was making the sound

587
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,600
we

588
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,039
like this like not we as in she was

589
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,400
having a good time but

590
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
she felt she had to put the reflective

591
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
and the analytical on

592
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
it because she was going first she

593
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,480
wasn't she wasn't thinking about how

594
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
much fun she was having

595
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
she was thinking about oh i'm supposed

596
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
to say this is exciting even though i'm

597
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
really not sure if i'm gonna go off into

598
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
the trees or whatever

599
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,799
and so it's it's fascinating how we kind

600
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,120
of get habituated to this idea that

601
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
in a cultural setting we have to let

602
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,640
others know

603
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
we're having fun when really what we're

604
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,640
trying to do is not

605
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
fall off the scooter right like that's

606
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
that's a big part of this this

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
overthinking piece

608
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
nice and a roller coaster where you

609
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,159
can't change

610
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,280
the way that the roller coaster is

611
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
working but you know it just erupts

612
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,520
people

613
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
screaming or something like that what is

614
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,400
going on there

615
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
optimal or laughing in a stand-up comedy

616
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
situation

617
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
so optimal control theory

618
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
so that's oct and they define oct

619
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,960
is a field in mathematical optimization

620
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,039
that deals with finding a control

621
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,080
for a dynamical system but they spend

622
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
most of the discussion of course with a

623
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
focus on motor behavior

624
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,640
and so they introduce the ocmt

625
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,159
optimal control motor theory and right

626
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,200
omct is a label for the modeling tools

627
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
used to study

628
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,799
motor behavior and its neural processing

629
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,600
we target

630
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,799
specifically omct to show that it rests

631
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,039
on the instructionist assumption which

632
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
we're going to cover

633
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
that the brain literally contains and

634
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
leverages explicit instructions for

635
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,360
movements

636
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
so what did either of you think

637
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
about ocmt

638
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
i just thought it was really interesting

639
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,039
because i would imagine that there would

640
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
be some emotion on the part of the

641
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
spotter not the person on the

642
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,240
handstand if suddenly his cigarette fell

643
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,360
out of his mouth i assume that's a

644
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,880
cigarette that's in his mouth

645
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,200
but he wouldn't even be aware of the

646
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,159
fact that he lost

647
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,720
something that he was losing optimal

648
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
control

649
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,039
because his focus was elsewhere in front

650
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,760
of him

651
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
so again you you have to kind of you

652
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,679
have to kind of take this idea of skill

653
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
and make sure that you understand

654
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
what you're talking about because uh

655
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,880
yeah

656
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
there's probably a lot of skill

657
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,159
perceived in the person doing the

658
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,720
handstand

659
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
but there's also other skills going off

660
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,320
there that we don't give as much

661
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
attention over to

662
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
yep there's the skill of standing up

663
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,919
which is a dynamic

664
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,320
process there's holding an object in the

665
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,919
lips even of the observer

666
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,240
and then there's the spotter's skill to

667
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,039
know

668
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,720
when to intervene and when not to

669
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
intervene and

670
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
half the battle is knowing when not to

671
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,679
move

672
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
and when to just let it ride and trust

673
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,120
in the partner

674
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
so it's kind of cool that when people

675
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
look at this photo

676
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
they might immediately be highlighting

677
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,640
this sort of

678
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,360
difficult looking task the stacked

679
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
chairs and whatnot but

680
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
it's an idea that would help us explain

681
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,880
this whole situation

682
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
as active inference agents engaging in

683
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,640
motor behavior potentially

684
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
well it just asks us to redefine what

685
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,880
command and control is

686
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,320
basically nice

687
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
so how about instructionism so on the

688
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,640
left is a quote which

689
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
we're not going to read in full but

690
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
they do right down there at the bottom

691
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
and um i know blue that we'll have a

692
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,440
little bit to say on this from the

693
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
genetics angle

694
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
but they write following wheeler and

695
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
clark's 1999

696
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
paper yes that andy clark we will refer

697
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,159
to this position as instructionism

698
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,320
which is the idea that skill is

699
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,559
essentially of a theoretical nature

700
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
mediated by knowledge we cast

701
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,720
instructionism

702
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
in terms of explicit instructions that

703
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,559
is forms of knowledge that directly

704
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,679
guide performance

705
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,279
like okay i'm supposed to run over to

706
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,039
the left side of the stage when i hear

707
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,320
the timpani

708
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
boom applied to skillful performance

709
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
the instructionist assumption prescribes

710
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
that instructions are harnessed

711
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
inseparable

712
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,880
structures such as beliefs and then on

713
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,919
the left side

714
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,480
is the abstract and title of wheeler and

715
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
clark 99

716
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,799
which is actually a paper called genic

717
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,679
representation

718
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,720
about genes reconciling content and

719
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
causal complexity so blue any

720
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
thoughts on where genes come into play

721
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,440
i mean it's all right like uh

722
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,320
there's penetrance and there's you know

723
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,360
all of these things

724
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,880
that come into this you know genetic um

725
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
relationship and so i think it's it's

726
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
interesting to think about and also

727
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,960
i think as the authors point out that

728
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,120
there's you know the genes

729
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,679
aren't really the instructions for

730
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,960
creating protein

731
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
right like they are just the fundamental

732
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,080
blueprint

733
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
so they don't have such a direct

734
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
relationship with with action

735
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
they're just like the belief system

736
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,240
they're not the intention

737
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,120
i don't know we're gonna spiral back to

738
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
the mapping between

739
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
genes and motor representations in a

740
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,559
little bit

741
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,799
but just cool that they drew from a

742
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,159
different area

743
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,640
of philosophy and science to be building

744
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
their instructionist point but

745
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,919
for the next few slides let's focus back

746
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,919
in on the motor behavior

747
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,799
so here we highlight a few different

748
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,760
attributes

749
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,640
of instructionism so if somebody is

750
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
asking well like what is instructionism

751
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
or what are its characteristics or how

752
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,240
would i know if

753
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
a theory is being cast in an

754
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
instructionist frame

755
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,120
here in red we have um a few words like

756
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,720
separability and its cousin modularity

757
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,279
we have representational thinking which

758
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
we're going to come back to as well

759
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
and normativity meaning how things

760
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,320
should be done and these are quotes

761
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,960
saying

762
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
instructionism saying that instructions

763
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
come in the form of separable structures

764
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
such as beliefs

765
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,880
so that implies separability modularity

766
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,000
and then they also

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,640
say that instructionism suggests that

768
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
performance is enabled by

769
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
motor representations which harness

770
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,240
knowledge about how a specific skillful

771
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,880
performance

772
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
should be executed like if the

773
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,080
instructions were to

774
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
have you fall over that's not how you

775
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
get to a walking person

776
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
so it's about how things should be and

777
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,279
then if there's like something on your

778
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:57,679
leg

779
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,360
grabbing you down it's about how you

780
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,039
should escape so

781
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,080
here's kind of a um an example

782
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,159
of instructionism with a person chopping

783
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,120
herbs

784
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
and it's almost like you could imagine

785
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
step one you know first instruction

786
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
grip the herbs with one hand step two

787
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
grip the knife and then step three is

788
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,440
gonna be like move your arm up and then

789
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
move your arm down

790
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
move it up go to the side drop it down

791
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
again so that's sort of

792
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
a simplification but it's highlighting

793
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,399
how it's representing

794
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,720
it's saying what should be done and it's

795
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,840
giving separable

796
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,399
instructions like a recipe and so it's

797
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,080
kind of a knowledge knowledge-driven

798
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,520
pseudo-code or recipe for

799
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,480
getting a motor behavior done okay first

800
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,000
you're gonna just do this then you're

801
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
gonna do that

802
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,799
um and they basically again highlight

803
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,200
and

804
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,039
cite suggesting that most accounts of

805
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
motor representation have in common

806
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,760
that they're representations of

807
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,000
knowledge that get translated

808
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,360
in a way into motor action so that's the

809
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,039
instructionism

810
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,159
any thoughts on the knife slide

811
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,799
so you know having watched a chef do

812
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,399
this like when i used to work in

813
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,679
restaurants and then

814
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,840
like trying to teach my children like my

815
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
daughter's nine right like

816
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
it is horrifying i'm like you are gonna

817
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,600
cut your finger off but like you watch a

818
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,000
chef

819
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
and they can do it they can be talking

820
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
to you and you know i mean like doing 10

821
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,240
other things and

822
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
chop chop chop like not even looking or

823
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,360
paying attention just

824
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
driving by by sheer kinesthetic memory

825
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,520
uh and then my daughter's like girl it's

826
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,919
really scary

827
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,559
yep but if um the instructions were too

828
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,120
strong

829
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
then the individual would never learn

830
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,200
how to chop without the direct

831
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
oversight so it's sort of uh yeah

832
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
one thing does this not demonstrate

833
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,399
clearly

834
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,679
that knowledge and information are not

835
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,159
the same thing

836
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,360
what do you mean by that well i mean

837
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
both are portable

838
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
but do we do we assume that they're the

839
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
same thing when in fact

840
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
what knowledge is is it demarcates

841
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,640
how much mental time travel we can we

842
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,360
can span

843
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
as opposed to information which can fill

844
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
up volumes right

845
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,880
but it's not the same thing one is that

846
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
one is literally that we open the lid on

847
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,240
the brain

848
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,919
and we pour this stuff in but when we

849
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,640
when we

850
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,279
unpack that it doesn't come out the way

851
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,159
that it

852
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,559
it went in it comes out and the

853
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,480
knowledge comes out as

854
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
something that we can relate in terms of

855
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
time spans that's why we've had a lot of

856
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
these conversations in a lot of these

857
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,279
a lot of these livestreams that i

858
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
participated in there a lot of people

859
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
now are coming back to so what role does

860
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,559
the hippocampus play

861
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,880
is it a spatial thing or can we

862
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,000
segregate that out from

863
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
time or are these time cells

864
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
as opposed to space cells i don't

865
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,039
i i'm not going to go much further on

866
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,840
this but

867
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
i believe that this slide shows once and

868
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,679
for all

869
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,039
that we should stop thinking of

870
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,559
information as knowledge

871
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
so i've thought a lot about this dean

872
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,880
about um

873
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
the relationship right between like

874
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,840
information

875
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
data knowledge and

876
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,600
wisdom and like i've thought about this

877
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
in kind of like big groups and come with

878
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
to like touch on some tentative

879
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,240
definitions like data is information

880
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
that's useful right in some way

881
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
and then knowledge is you know the the

882
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
the application of of the data or or the

883
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,799
the interpretation of the data

884
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
and then like where wisdom is kind of

885
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,000
knowing how to

886
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,679
apply the knowledge right so it's kind

887
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,440
of like a a succession

888
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
of but from you know information to

889
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,919
wisdom i i look at it in like a

890
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,720
like a hierarchical model do you see how

891
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,440
people that

892
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
are having difficulty maybe they're

893
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,799
they're

894
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,760
addressing issues with dementia or

895
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
alzheimer's and when they're

896
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,120
when their ability to mentally time

897
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
travel collapses

898
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,640
so does their knowledge

899
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,519
very interesting at least

900
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,720
from a working memory and fluid ability

901
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,440
to

902
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
integrate and interpret in those things

903
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
now again

904
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
i don't want to go off into the weeds so

905
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,159
i'm not going to do that

906
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,039
but i think one of the biggest problems

907
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,159
that

908
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
this paper is pointing out is if you

909
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,519
believe that

910
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,440
information and knowledge are the same

911
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
thing you might want to go

912
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
to a place that says command and control

913
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,679
is what's actually happening

914
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,960
my suggestion is this this blows that up

915
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,399
right here right now now maybe i'm wrong

916
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
but i don't think i am so interestingly

917
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,039
dean i don't know if you

918
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,960
know this or not but alzheimer's and

919
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,399
dementia patients

920
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,320
um like while they won't even remember

921
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,000
the names of their children

922
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,640
they do remember the lyrics to songs

923
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,799
right and and like they remember music

924
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,360
in a way that is very different so

925
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,799
perhaps when you get to

926
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,279
the level of you know skilled

927
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
performance and and i know like the

928
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
active inference is going to

929
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,080
kind of squish all motor in in a minute

930
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,120
we're going to squish it all together

931
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,399
but when you think about skill

932
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,760
performance perhaps

933
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
that knowledge is integrated in a deeper

934
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,000
way right like you might be able to give

935
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,519
to get an alzheimer's patient if they

936
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,279
were physically capable um

937
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,760
to ride a bicycle like they still retain

938
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
that knowledge

939
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,519
without having to do some kind of

940
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,200
command so there's maybe like

941
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
some chain in the link is broken there

942
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
it's interesting to think about

943
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,440
yeah i mean i've got i got i've got

944
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,240
first-hand

945
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,720
experience because i've got family that

946
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
are that are addressing this

947
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
and yeah so i know exactly what you're

948
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
saying and again

949
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,679
i don't i don't want to i don't want to

950
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
carry this off too far but i think it's

951
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,399
i think it's worth contemplating what

952
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,679
knowledge is

953
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,000
relative to what information is that's

954
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
all

955
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,880
awesome points and for moving bodies

956
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
bodies in motion space and time

957
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,880
are going to be deeply intertwined

958
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
you're always somewhere somewhen

959
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,000
but we have the clock and we have the

960
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,760
gps and so it makes it seem like you

961
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,440
could separate those out but not for the

962
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
body

963
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,360
not for the embodied agent

964
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
so there's a few uh types of

965
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
instructionism

966
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
that they then flesh out so that was the

967
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,399
big category it's about instructions

968
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,320
and they distinguish two kinds of

969
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,480
instructionism the strong form

970
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,519
and the weak form the strong form

971
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,640
is the claim that neural representations

972
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
so specific like firing patterns and

973
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,000
neurons and

974
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
things like that completely specify on

975
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,600
their own

976
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
the specific movements to be executed so

977
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,200
if like you were recording from the

978
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
brain you could just template out

979
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
a specific firing sequence or a specific

980
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,320
pattern

981
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640
and then that would be like the contract

982
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,120
bicep now signal

983
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,359
and the weaker form of instructionism is

984
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,960
a more modest claim

985
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,199
that among the many dynamically coupled

986
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,639
systems that generate skillful

987
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,440
performance

988
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
so the neurons in the bicep and

989
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,199
everything in between and different

990
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,079
regions in the brain

991
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,520
so all those dynamically coupled systems

992
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,399
there is a special kind maybe you didn't

993
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,839
capture it maybe you don't know what it

994
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,960
is but there there

995
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,159
ought to be a special kind and those are

996
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
the structures internal to an agent that

997
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,119
are responsible for encoding

998
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,639
information or instructions that are

999
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,239
relevant for action

1000
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,320
given the background of everything else

1001
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,918
that is enabling that role

1002
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,239
so in this modest account motor

1003
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,280
representations

1004
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
play the role in the generation of

1005
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,719
behavior

1006
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,960
analogous to genes in the generation of

1007
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
phenotypic traits

1008
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,000
so the strong form is like um would be

1009
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,240
like as strong as saying that the

1010
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
protein was hiding inside of the gene

1011
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
and then a dna gene and then it just

1012
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,480
popped out

1013
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
whereas the weaker form is saying

1014
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,079
there's a lot of dynamically coupled

1015
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,119
systems

1016
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,800
and um this weak instruction is

1017
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,640
something that's distributed maybe even

1018
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
among them but that's the part of the

1019
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,000
dynamics of the system

1020
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,280
that are relevant for action so strong

1021
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,079
and weak

1022
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
and it turns out that they're going to

1023
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,280
um

1024
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,520
have something to say about both them so

1025
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,480
let's go

1026
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
to is that good anything to add on that

1027
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,599
one

1028
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,640
yeah so here um

1029
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,839
they're going to highlight the weak

1030
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
instructionist claim

1031
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,839
but as you can see from the bottom of

1032
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,520
the slide they're going to argue that

1033
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,000
neither

1034
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
kind of instructionism is warranted so

1035
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
whether you take a strong or a weak

1036
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
approach

1037
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
they say that you're still making the

1038
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,599
same type of error

1039
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,079
although maybe you're making it more

1040
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,680
egregiously or not

1041
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,920
the weak instructionist framework for

1042
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
motor representation

1043
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,200
says that skillful performance is the

1044
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,680
result of an orchestrated process

1045
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,359
spanning components in the brain body

1046
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,000
and world but some of these components

1047
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
especially those in the brain play

1048
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
specific

1049
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,160
explanatory irreducible roles of

1050
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
encoding explicit instructions for motor

1051
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
performance

1052
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,760
so that is the instructionist mindset

1053
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,400
and

1054
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,079
for those of you you know inside or

1055
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,680
outside of the active inference

1056
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,880
game is that your implicit

1057
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,280
understanding of like what is happening

1058
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
would you say that there is

1059
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
something like an instruction for pick

1060
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
up the finger or

1061
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,200
is there something like i should be

1062
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
peddling in the brain

1063
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,839
because that's the exact kind of notion

1064
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
that they're going to be seeking to

1065
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,160
challenge

1066
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,040
so that's what's on the table is any

1067
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,359
idea no matter how strong or weak

1068
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,160
that instructions can be something that

1069
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,640
is

1070
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,560
distributed throughout the system are

1071
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,079
useful for skillful performance

1072
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,280
that's what they're going to be

1073
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,079
critiquing blue

1074
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,160
um so i just really wanted to kind of

1075
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,760
loop back to the gene

1076
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
um versus protein right so so

1077
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
a dna gene gets transcribed or

1078
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
yeah transcribed into mrna and then

1079
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
translated into protein and so

1080
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
but you can still like have

1081
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,480
environmental modifications on that dna

1082
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:18,880
gene

1083
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
which i think that's kind of a neat um

1084
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
like

1085
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,839
way to kind of think about it like you

1086
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,680
can have methylation

1087
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,640
um epigenetic modifications or like you

1088
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,359
can also have

1089
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
like suppression of the gene like by

1090
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
rolling it up in the chromatin so

1091
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,240
so many different like environmental

1092
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
factors can still map on to that dna

1093
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,680
gene to modify

1094
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
it so that the instructions are somehow

1095
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
different

1096
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,920
cool so let's go from

1097
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,839
instructionism of any kind to

1098
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,640
representation

1099
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,000
so if there is some sort of instruction

1100
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
in any part of the system whether it's

1101
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
in one neuron or

1102
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,839
a set of neurons or it's between neurons

1103
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,520
and glia and all kinds of cells

1104
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,680
if there is some kind of representation

1105
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,440
what is that representation

1106
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
so here's a quote from the paper with a

1107
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,359
red box they wrote

1108
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,119
what does it mean for a thing to

1109
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,040
explicitly represent some state of

1110
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,079
affairs

1111
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,839
it is common in the philosophy of mind

1112
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
to argue that representations

1113
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,560
involve modes of presentation

1114
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,000
it's right there re-presentation

1115
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,960
and that um sort of made me curious

1116
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,560
about following to this

1117
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,480
phrase uh not sure if that's the

1118
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,079
pronunciation 1892

1119
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
citation sense and reference

1120
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,560
and um there's a few pieces that

1121
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,000
were kind of interesting about this 1892

1122
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,280
paper

1123
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,560
so one thing is that it's written

1124
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
the question of truth would cause us to

1125
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,680
abandon aesthetic delight for an

1126
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,160
attitude of scientific investigation

1127
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,400
so that's maybe even like the spirit of

1128
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,200
what we do

1129
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,119
here we try to be clear when we're

1130
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,640
talking about what we want to be clear

1131
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,280
about

1132
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,839
but we always want to leave the door in

1133
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,280
the window and the roof

1134
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,800
open for aesthetics and for art and for

1135
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,680
that kind of delight hence it's a matter

1136
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,520
of indifference to us whether the name

1137
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,640
odysseus for instance has a referent

1138
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
so long as we accept the poem as a work

1139
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,119
of art it's the striving for truth that

1140
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,240
derives us

1141
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
always to advance from the sense to the

1142
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,359
referent

1143
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,119
and that is what um is known as the

1144
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,320
semiotic triad which is the relationship

1145
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,880
between

1146
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,400
the symbol which is like maybe dean

1147
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
actually what would you say about the

1148
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,119
semiatic triad yeah

1149
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,960
it's it's back to piercy and stuff

1150
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,640
charles sanders pierce what i think is

1151
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,520
really interesting

1152
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,400
again is that you can have a content

1153
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,599
policy

1154
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,359
so you can have information in

1155
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,040
representative form

1156
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,280
but knowledge is actually a change

1157
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,079
policy

1158
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,680
it's the advance from

1159
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,480
sense to referent so you don't want to

1160
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,520
mix the two things

1161
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,880
up one is content the other is change

1162
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
and if you want to say that apples are

1163
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,119
oranges you can have that

1164
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,880
i'm not saying that our minds aren't

1165
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,160
capable of doing that

1166
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,480
but you can't impose it and that's what

1167
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
i think that

1168
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,800
maybe i look like a guy from the 1890s

1169
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
because i just have a lot of respect for

1170
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,319
everything that they talked about 100

1171
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,079
years ago but yeah

1172
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,040
i mean it's right there you don't want

1173
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,599
to fly

1174
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
you don't want to crash your your your

1175
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,079
airplane into that mountain

1176
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,440
is my point mount sense um and then also

1177
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,839
that

1178
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,119
um note 6 right after art is it'd be

1179
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,880
desirable to have a special term for

1180
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,119
signs having only sense

1181
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,240
hmm what would it mean to have sense

1182
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,720
like it compiles in a sensical way but

1183
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,599
it doesn't have

1184
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,160
reference if we name them say

1185
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,760
representations the words of the actors

1186
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
on stage would be representations

1187
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
indeed the actor himself would be

1188
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
representation well

1189
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,880
what if all the world's a stage and then

1190
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,760
who's not

1191
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,160
representing so these are some really

1192
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,240
cool ideas about what

1193
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,000
is being um communicated symbolically

1194
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,520
when we use symbols like language so

1195
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
representation is a big topic and we

1196
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,880
talked about

1197
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,720
the representation wars and about

1198
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,000
representation and active

1199
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
inference beyond internalism and

1200
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,920
externalism it's a topic we're going to

1201
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,599
probably be coming back to forever

1202
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,720
because it's such a rich

1203
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,040
area let's go back to motor

1204
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,480
representations though

1205
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,880
so that's what a representation was sort

1206
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,680
of broadly

1207
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,000
but bringing it back to the body to the

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,880
motor behavior

1209
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,520
they cite a 2017 paper that provides a

1210
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,880
definition of motor representations

1211
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,000
this account is basically coming from a

1212
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,720
combination

1213
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,599
of pragmatism practical representations

1214
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,119
as well as computational

1215
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,000
neuroscience research and they highlight

1216
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,040
three

1217
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,480
key attributes in this modern research

1218
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
on motor representation the first is

1219
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
that those motor representations

1220
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,440
um represent objects and situation in

1221
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,359
terms of their properties relevant for

1222
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,000
action

1223
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,720
so like a great example is like a cup it

1224
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,760
has a handle

1225
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,160
and like your brain will do a different

1226
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,960
thing

1227
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
when somebody grabs it from the top or

1228
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,560
when somebody grabs it

1229
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,680
um with a weird way of grabbing it so we

1230
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,040
see objects for actions

1231
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,960
we see things to sit on and things to

1232
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,079
grab

1233
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,839
we don't just see the pixels or anything

1234
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,240
like that a second key aspect of motor

1235
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,440
representation

1236
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,920
is that they're informed by or contain

1237
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,800
implicitly

1238
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,319
some knowledge about the body's

1239
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,200
biomechanical and kinematic constraints

1240
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
so you'll see something for gripping

1241
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
that's like grippable

1242
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,520
you won't see like a 10-foot pipe as

1243
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
being something you could grip

1244
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,359
but then as it shrinks given the

1245
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,000
implicit

1246
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,760
or explicit knowledge of what the body

1247
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
can do it becomes something that's

1248
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,880
grippable

1249
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,359
and then third they say that motor

1250
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,440
representations at least usually

1251
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,680
serve the execution of transient

1252
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,720
movements

1253
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
so in that knife cutting example there's

1254
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,920
a motor representation for like

1255
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
contract up and bring start to bring the

1256
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,040
arm up

1257
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,079
but it doesn't need to be the

1258
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,079
representation of like the entire

1259
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,960
story arc it just has to be a transient

1260
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
executable

1261
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,599
um motor action so that's

1262
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,440
again motor representation it's within

1263
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,640
this instructionism

1264
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,119
frame and then dean you had a really

1265
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,319
interesting comment down here

1266
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,960
well all i wanted to point out was that

1267
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,240
um

1268
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,880
so the active inference allows us to

1269
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,160
well what they're going to talk about

1270
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,000
what we're going to get to is the the

1271
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,720
the gender that generative model

1272
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,200
can be inverted but essentially there's

1273
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,880
top down on the and there's bottom up

1274
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,000
and i think that's what needs to be

1275
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,119
included but it's

1276
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
i in the last sentence of that little

1277
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
comment world to mind and mind to world

1278
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,359
that ability to sort of go

1279
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,960
bottom up and top down assumes that a

1280
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,160
capacity to differentiate what actually

1281
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,760
what actually contains um

1282
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
and then what what is contained in a

1283
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,880
practical sense

1284
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
beyond a thought experiment we can all

1285
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,400
do thought experiments

1286
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,440
we can all reflect and analyze prior to

1287
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,480
and and post

1288
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,920
but when you're in that otherwise and

1289
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,640
you're actually carrying it out

1290
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
you're sort of going beyond that thought

1291
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
experiment so

1292
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,599
how do we how do we address that when

1293
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
we're doing our motor representing

1294
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,680
is what i basically wanted and that's

1295
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,119
just from the paper yeah

1296
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,200
basically vc's decomposition cool

1297
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,960
we're having so much fun but we are

1298
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,720
going to i think try to get through the

1299
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,439
rest of the slides

1300
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,040
here's one way that motor

1301
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,560
representations are used just in the

1302
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,440
literature

1303
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,920
they use fmri they find a pattern that

1304
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,079
correlates with a certain motor behavior

1305
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,640
and that is discussed as being the motor

1306
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,000
representation

1307
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,319
so that's how scientists are using the

1308
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,839
term

1309
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,000
we can think about motor representations

1310
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,160
as being motor commands

1311
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,720
so i think blue did you um make this one

1312
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,800
and want to add something here

1313
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,680
yeah sure so um this motor command i

1314
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,359
thought was interesting because

1315
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,760
it's like you have to have the forward

1316
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,880
and the reverse

1317
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,280
in this in this motor command so you

1318
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,560
have to already know

1319
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,240
the outcome that you like you have to

1320
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
envision the outcome in that said

1321
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,280
environment um and then work backwards

1322
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,000
from there so i'll just read this part

1323
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,640
in blue

1324
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,599
it says that this entails an inverse

1325
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,800
inference problem

1326
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,240
which requires working back from the

1327
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
desired sensory consequences

1328
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,800
eg desired visual and proprio receptive

1329
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,079
sensory feedback

1330
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,400
to a specification of their motor cause

1331
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
in an intrinsic frame of reference

1332
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
i.e a set of muscle activations that can

1333
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,760
generate

1334
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,880
such desired consequences so i just

1335
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,480
thought that that was an interesting

1336
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,960
um way to think about it and i always

1337
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,560
loved the picture of like the

1338
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,800
this is like the motor representation

1339
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,240
like the literal

1340
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,040
like motor representation on um the

1341
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,560
cerebellum and so it just

1342
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,000
shows or or maybe this is cortex um

1343
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,040
so this is literally like how it maps to

1344
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,720
the sensory cortex

1345
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,359
like your which part of your piece of

1346
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,960
your brain literally maps to each piece

1347
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,599
of your body

1348
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,319
it's interesting and it reminds me of

1349
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:22,960
coaching

1350
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,160
cues like lift lift lift or push

1351
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,640
something like that you say what you

1352
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,440
want to see

1353
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,839
happen lift the bar or something like

1354
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:32,560
that you don't

1355
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,040
have to say every single cue so that's

1356
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,680
sort of a semantic way of engaging

1357
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
with what's happening across the brain

1358
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,119
and

1359
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,319
across the body and to bring

1360
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,800
the motor to action before we go to

1361
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,720
active inference

1362
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,280
they um talk about action-oriented

1363
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,119
representations as being

1364
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,000
the motor representations that are for

1365
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,560
action

1366
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,760
so anything on this blue

1367
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,359
yeah but it's another example like

1368
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,720
breathe in pretend you're smelling a

1369
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,760
flower

1370
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,640
which one conveys more of a story and

1371
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,160
that reminds me actually of dave

1372
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,440
snowden's

1373
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,160
address not so long ago where instead of

1374
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,680
just asking someone you know tell me a

1375
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,240
story

1376
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,440
about san francisco you'd say

1377
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,680
a friend only has two minutes and they

1378
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,200
want to know the single thing that's

1379
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,359
most exciting to visit when they go

1380
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,079
that's a very rich setup for somebody to

1381
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,520
tell a story in

1382
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,559
and so it relates to giving suggestive

1383
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,280
cues

1384
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,319
that are richer than just contract your

1385
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,720
bicep but you could give a cue

1386
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
you know bend it like beckham or

1387
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,319
something like that you can make a

1388
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,040
metaphor or you can allude to something

1389
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,760
that actually

1390
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,040
invokes more activation you know

1391
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
would be interesting can people deadlift

1392
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
more if you say all right

1393
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,200
lift up the car you know somebody's

1394
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,000
underneath it

1395
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
go for it or you know you're going to

1396
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,359
win this competition

1397
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,079
if you do this those are like very

1398
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,319
action oriented motivators dean

1399
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,040
yeah actually i put this in here this

1400
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,160
slide because

1401
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,480
one of the i did a lot of coaching in my

1402
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
life probably 30 years of it

1403
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,079
and i think one of the things that i

1404
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,559
found as an as an effective coach

1405
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,839
is you want to think of it as as

1406
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,960
any puzzle piece is missing back to that

1407
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,800
back to that's i don't want to go back

1408
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,880
up to the slider the guy was balancing

1409
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,359
on the edge of the building but again as

1410
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,559
a coach

1411
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,079
there'll be things that the person who's

1412
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,240
performing that motor skill

1413
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
will be thinking about and what what

1414
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,880
what an effective coach tends to do

1415
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,079
is try to bring into

1416
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,400
into the the realm of what they are

1417
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,280
focusing on

1418
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,440
without interfering with that without

1419
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,599
adding a bunch of cognitive

1420
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,800
issues that again get in the way of

1421
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,200
of of doing making it an overthinking

1422
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,040
thing if you can breathe if you can

1423
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,880
remind a person to breathe out

1424
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,240
or exhale just before they do something

1425
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,599
that they would do that autonomically

1426
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,960
but if you can actually get them to

1427
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,720
think about that that again

1428
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,280
that's a mind-calming exercise that's

1429
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,640
actually a pretty effective coaching

1430
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,319
tool

1431
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,480
cool and i think we're going to come

1432
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,079
back to that with instruction versus

1433
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,040
interaction

1434
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,520
exactly then we turn to active inference

1435
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,640
yay and they have box one

1436
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,960
in their uh paper at the very end where

1437
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,839
they define active inference

1438
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,440
was it a reviewer did they want to

1439
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,160
clarify we'll find out soon

1440
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,040
and they basically write that a system

1441
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
can be described to engage in active

1442
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,680
inference

1443
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,280
in the sense of performing belief

1444
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
updating and acting such as to fulfill

1445
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,400
prior preferences about observations

1446
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,960
because

1447
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,200
in active inference there's kind of two

1448
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
things that the system can do

1449
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,640
it can act or it can infer it can update

1450
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,240
its action states

1451
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,400
it can update its internal generative

1452
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,920
model of the world those are sort of the

1453
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,559
two

1454
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,400
levers that it has to play with because

1455
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,000
it can't directly control the

1456
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,119
observations

1457
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,880
but those two levers action and

1458
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,480
inference are being

1459
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,680
played with in service of reducing

1460
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,319
uncertainty about observations

1461
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,319
so that's some of the key attributes of

1462
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,079
active inference

1463
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,760
and they suggest that active inference

1464
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,440
provides a mechanism

1465
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,760
to derive the dynamics of sensory and

1466
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,359
active states which are these two

1467
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,760
blanket states on this image such that

1468
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,640
they minimize

1469
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
a variational free energy functional so

1470
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,319
we're not going to go into that

1471
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,200
now but there's basically an equation a

1472
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,240
formalism

1473
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,200
that trades off model complexity how

1474
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,720
many parameters it has

1475
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,920
with model accuracy so real systems are

1476
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,400
sort of

1477
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,640
on this razor's edge where they want to

1478
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,359
have well-fitting but simple models

1479
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,000
and then the tuning between you know

1480
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,440
great tasting and less filling

1481
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,480
the tuning between fewer parameters and

1482
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,760
better fit

1483
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,319
that is where active inference agents

1484
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,680
are surfing

1485
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,400
anything on active inference or let's

1486
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,839
just see how it gets

1487
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,720
used

1488
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,280
so the paper draws extensively on first

1489
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,319
in 2011

1490
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,400
the figures and a lot of the citations

1491
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,480
so it's worthwhile to

1492
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
actually go to that first in 2011 paper

1493
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,359
if you're curious about a deeper level

1494
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,400
and here from the um

1495
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,960
skillful performance paper they

1496
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,920
basically

1497
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,480
oh this is actually sorry this is from

1498
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
uh first in 2011.

1499
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,040
despite the compelling simplicity of the

1500
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
optimal control approach

1501
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,800
he's saying that it's wrong for two

1502
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,079
reasons

1503
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,119
the first is that basing

1504
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,720
on the ideas from information flow

1505
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,400
he's going to suggest that motion cannot

1506
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,000
be specified by a single

1507
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,160
value function there might be many

1508
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,319
different ways to achieve a goal

1509
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,800
so it might be hard to rank or even

1510
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,839
compare

1511
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,680
totally different ways of achieving that

1512
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,200
goal on

1513
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,960
a value only framework and then secondly

1514
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,640
optimal control theory assumes that

1515
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,000
movement is caused

1516
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,520
or determined by value like motors

1517
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,559
motor actions are valued differentially

1518
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,040
and then

1519
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,240
ones that are more valuable are

1520
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,559
undertaken however

1521
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,240
value is an attribute of the states that

1522
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,520
are caused by movement it's a

1523
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,319
consequence

1524
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,720
not a cause this means that the real

1525
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,640
problem is to understand the acquisition

1526
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,559
and realization of beliefs that cause

1527
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:29,440
movement

1528
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,200
in other words to understand motor

1529
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,319
control in terms of inference and belief

1530
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,520
and then another really interesting

1531
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,640
piece was to describe optimal control

1532
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,760
even way back when in 2011 as

1533
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,040
active inference with three

1534
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,200
simplifications so the first

1535
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,559
simplification

1536
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,960
is saying you gotta combine action

1537
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,400
inference together

1538
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,480
you could simplify and consider only

1539
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,559
action or consider only perception

1540
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,240
but optimal control is not um as

1541
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,920
is not dealing with those two in a way

1542
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,400
as integrated as active inference

1543
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,119
the second simplification has to do with

1544
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,480
the delays

1545
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,640
in the signals so that's a little bit of

1546
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,000
a motor specific

1547
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
a more neural perspective on motor

1548
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,359
control

1549
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,280
and then the third piece which is

1550
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,200
perhaps the most salient

1551
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,640
is to realize that value alone and cost

1552
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,760
functions

1553
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,800
doesn't get you all the way to embodied

1554
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,680
action

1555
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,920
but embodied action is more consistent

1556
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,040
with thinking about how

1557
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,920
organisms have prior beliefs about what

1558
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,760
kind of motor behaviors are likely for

1559
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,720
them

1560
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,280
and that is a broader framework than

1561
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,160
just value

1562
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,720
so that's first in 2011 but there's of

1563
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,160
course a whole paper there so if you're

1564
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,040
curious you should

1565
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,920
check it out okay figure one

1566
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,000
want to take a first pass on this one

1567
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,079
sure i'll read it so they

1568
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,920
just like um we had talked about earlier

1569
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,599
you have the extrinsic frame of

1570
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
reference like what needs to be done

1571
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,480
in in this environment right so the

1572
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,160
motor plant is the physical

1573
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,200
motor system like a limb that executes

1574
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,640
the task to be

1575
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,760
performed and that's the

1576
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,960
plant kinetics equation here

1577
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,200
and then physical movements of the motor

1578
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,240
plant in turn

1579
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,640
generate sensory information this

1580
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,000
information is conveyed

1581
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,200
to a state estimator via a sensory

1582
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,520
mapping so that's the sensory mapping

1583
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,440
process the next equation

1584
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,760
and then there's the the state estimator

1585
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,839
in the middle

1586
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,760
and over on the right the forward model

1587
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,119
it says the function of the forward

1588
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,640
model is to improve

1589
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,760
the execution of action by helping

1590
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,880
to finesse the inferences of the state

1591
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,599
estimator and you can see that there's a

1592
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,640
feedback with

1593
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,799
the state estimator both forward and

1594
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,400
backwards

1595
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,760
uh and then the reference copy says the

1596
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,280
optimal controller oh yeah that's this

1597
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,799
next part down here at the bottom

1598
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,040
um the optimal controller maps desired

1599
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,079
trajectories

1600
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,880
specified in extrinsic coordinates to

1601
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,839
muscle movements

1602
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,319
ie to changes in muscular states

1603
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,200
specified

1604
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,319
in terms of intrinsic coordinates um and

1605
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:14,880
then that

1606
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,720
goes back loops back to the plant

1607
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,079
kinetics

1608
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,359
yep so this is the whole um forward

1609
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,680
model in motor control so this is

1610
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,400
basically

1611
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,760
um the optimal motor control theory

1612
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,440
framing of what is happening in the

1613
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,200
brain

1614
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,520
um starts with a control implication

1615
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,000
like control theory or cybernetics

1616
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,359
motor behavior occurs in the the plant

1617
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,520
the motor plants the

1618
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,839
the infra plant but not here and then

1619
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,200
that gets mapped through sense

1620
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,400
to a state estimator where is my hand

1621
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,480
and then that is going to get in

1622
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
feedback with a forward model

1623
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,119
that then says oh your hand is too

1624
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:55,920
gripped

1625
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,720
it needs to relax and then that feeds

1626
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,160
back to the optimal control

1627
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,799
equation so whether these actually are

1628
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:03,599
instantiated

1629
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,079
in modules of the brain that's like the

1630
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,040
super strong

1631
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,359
take the weaker take would be or the

1632
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,799
instrumental take would be that we could

1633
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,240
model as if it were this way

1634
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,559
okay now they wrote about

1635
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,280
recalling this uh now they're gonna

1636
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,400
bring together the

1637
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,520
motor representations and this

1638
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,079
optimal motor control theory way of

1639
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,559
forward and reverse modeling so this is

1640
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,880
an intrinsic to extrinsic mapping

1641
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,280
intrinsic is the motor commands the

1642
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,520
representations internal to the system

1643
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,200
and the forward model goes from motor

1644
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,799
command to bodily motion

1645
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,520
so that's like the instruction is like

1646
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,079
relax

1647
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,160
the hand okay and then it gets

1648
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,520
implemented but interestingly just

1649
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,000
thinking

1650
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
relax your hand semantically or

1651
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,240
syntactically it doesn't open your hand

1652
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,040
right or you know play beethoven doesn't

1653
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,440
work

1654
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,079
quite like that so the instructions are

1655
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:58,480
not

1656
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,680
just what we hear in our inner voice

1657
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,760
but that is the forward model and then

1658
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,119
the inverse model

1659
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,799
would be the mapping from bodily motions

1660
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,720
back to the commands

1661
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,920
and to now connect it to their citation

1662
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,640
of the wheeler and clark 99

1663
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,160
it's like the dna genes it's a story for

1664
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,680
another day

1665
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,240
why the gene concept is a little bit

1666
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,400
more nuanced than just that but again

1667
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,440
that's another day the the genes the dna

1668
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,160
genes are like

1669
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,280
intrinsic and forward genetics

1670
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,599
is the study of how changes in dna

1671
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,319
influence

1672
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,359
phenotype and reverse genetics is going

1673
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,200
from an interesting phenotype

1674
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,880
and then asking what were the genetic

1675
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,319
changes that caused it

1676
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:45,599
so it actually helped me as a geneticist

1677
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,119
to understand what was happening here by

1678
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,880
thinking about forward and reverse

1679
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,920
genetics

1680
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,000
and then thinking okay so then the kinds

1681
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,119
of arguments

1682
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,160
that people make about how genes go to

1683
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,119
protein

1684
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,960
are like the arguments that people go

1685
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,799
from motor representations to motor

1686
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,000
behavior

1687
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,480
i.e that the information is in the genes

1688
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,839
it's in our dna

1689
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,599
i mean you see that on billboards on the

1690
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,000
freeway it's in our company's dna

1691
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,079
it's in our motor representation the

1692
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,599
motor behavior

1693
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,200
or is it so um they talk about forward

1694
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,359
and reverse model or inverse models and

1695
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,880
that's again like kind of like

1696
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,839
forward and reverse genetics any

1697
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,480
thoughts on that

1698
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,880
i was just thinking about self-driving

1699
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,119
cars and like where's that like motor

1700
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,839
representation

1701
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,720
and then dean you wrote a really nice

1702
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,680
point in the uh

1703
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,760
comments well i just i just i honestly

1704
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,440
why should i feel bad for omct but i did

1705
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,559
because it was at this point i was like

1706
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,880
man and and all the people that are sort

1707
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,559
of really invested in this they're like

1708
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,680
they're vested in this

1709
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,160
this is how it works and again it was

1710
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,880
kind of like

1711
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,079
okay if you want a set of commands like

1712
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,240
i understand a bunch of people that

1713
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,400
program and they've and they do that

1714
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,559
sort of thing and so it's an easy

1715
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,640
it's an easy transference to say that a

1716
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,799
content policy

1717
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,520
is also a change policy but how do you

1718
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,960
write out a change policy

1719
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,440
yep and i think this is just as you

1720
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,880
highlighted it in the notes there it

1721
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,520
says

1722
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,480
um the omct is inverting the forward

1723
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,119
model

1724
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,720
so they're literally looking for an

1725
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,400
inversion from the bodily back to the

1726
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,119
motor

1727
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,880
this is contrasted with active inference

1728
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,200
which replaces the inverse forward model

1729
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,240
pair

1730
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,720
with a generative model that expands on

1731
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,839
the forward model

1732
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,760
to harness probabilistic beliefs about

1733
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,720
the expected sensory causes of action

1734
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,559
so rather than using a separate inverse

1735
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,880
model to infer what is appropriate

1736
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,000
action

1737
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,760
you have basically just a generative

1738
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,839
model that's integrating

1739
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:55,599
that feedback loop you have

1740
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,960
yes so um this is

1741
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,480
uh an idea that i think we've heard

1742
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
steven talk about too the sandwich model

1743
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,400
the classical sandwich

1744
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,079
it's actually called the classical

1745
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,000
sandwich of cognition

1746
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,760
so this is kind of a classical sandwich

1747
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,280
for me that looked

1748
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,520
tasty um one of the

1749
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,040
every every stream with dean you've got

1750
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,820
to have like a sandwich or a hamburger

1751
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,920
[Laughter]

1752
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,960
um a scentee burger yes

1753
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,040
yeah this this is a a quasi sandwich

1754
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,160
a major assumption is in omct

1755
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,559
is the often implicit reliance on a

1756
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,880
sequential and modular architecture

1757
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,280
of perception cognition and action which

1758
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,880
is the sense model plan

1759
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,480
act or the ooda observed orient

1760
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,839
decide act paradigm or the classical

1761
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:48,799
sandwich

1762
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,160
so it kind of like sees these epochs of

1763
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,400
action where first a new stimuli comes

1764
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,920
in that's observe

1765
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,680
and then that gets integrated with

1766
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,280
cognition

1767
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,640
um orient and decide in the ooda loop or

1768
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,200
in the cognitive framing about modeling

1769
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,319
and planning

1770
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,839
and then that gets translated into

1771
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:13,040
seems fair that is the um sense

1772
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,559
think act cycle and that's the classical

1773
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,799
sandwich so i don't know what food

1774
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:19,680
active inference

1775
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,920
would be but it's not going to be a

1776
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,559
classical sandwich

1777
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,640
okay maybe we'll leave that as an open

1778
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,760
thought question

1779
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,400
if active inference were a food or a

1780
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,040
style

1781
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,079
of food what might it be um

1782
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,680
okay and then um that takes us

1783
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,920
so again they're just these are like

1784
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,839
they're sort of like two

1785
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,400
teams we have instructionism motor

1786
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,520
representation

1787
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,599
omct sense plan act classical sandwich

1788
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,319
that's not active inference active

1789
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,359
inference is gonna be

1790
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,119
in contrast to all of them and hopefully

1791
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,640
getting some of the limitations resolved

1792
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,839
um do you have anything to say about

1793
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,839
this um

1794
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,760
okay in this section less control more

1795
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,599
action they're gonna actually

1796
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,559
move we spent most of this video

1797
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,280
highlighting

1798
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,240
what that integrated set of ideas was

1799
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,640
the non-active inference ideas about how

1800
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,400
all those topics were related

1801
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,359
and they basically here are going to

1802
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,160
highlight

1803
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,200
how omct does have an instructionist

1804
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,920
assumption and how that relies on

1805
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,839
separable forward and inverse models

1806
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,200
rather than an integrated generative

1807
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,039
model and how that

1808
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,200
relates to motor commands rather than

1809
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,240
something else

1810
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,079
so finally we get to active inference

1811
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,319
and how motor control is going to occur

1812
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,280
and um we'll

1813
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,680
we'll juxtapose these two figures in a

1814
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,559
second

1815
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,839
but um this is again a similar drawing

1816
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,000
in fact it might even make sense just to

1817
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,559
show um figure 1 and figure 2 side by

1818
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,359
side

1819
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,039
because at first i looked at them i

1820
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,480
thought it's the same brain

1821
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,720
and i'm kind of seeing the same like

1822
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,319
shapes on it

1823
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,960
but we can go to 30 and look at the two

1824
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,920
differences

1825
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,520
so it's color coded left is the figure 1

1826
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,119
omct figure 2 is on the right with the

1827
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,960
active inference framing

1828
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
so we can see that plant kinetics and

1829
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,000
sensory mappings

1830
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,119
in red are found on both sides we also

1831
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,119
see that there's a forward model

1832
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,520
on both sides and that there is an

1833
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,160
optimal

1834
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,280
control element in blue on both sides

1835
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,880
but it's that state estimator

1836
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,319
at the nexus between the sensory mapping

1837
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,160
and the forward model and the optimal

1838
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,319
control there's the rub

1839
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,079
something is rotten in the state

1840
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,960
estimate of omct

1841
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,599
that's what hamlet would have said

1842
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,039
because there's something about

1843
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,640
estimating the state

1844
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,400
like that's where my hand is

1845
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,599
that isn't happening in active inference

1846
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,520
and that's really this key and

1847
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,039
interesting piece

1848
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,880
is that you can even look at the way

1849
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,720
that the models are connected

1850
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,160
to see that there's kind of like this

1851
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,079
fundamental loop between the generative

1852
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:06,480
model

1853
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,200
forward model in active inference and

1854
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,160
sense in action

1855
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
getting spun off of that loop act infer

1856
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,559
act infer that's active inference and

1857
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,880
here it's like

1858
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,400
perceive estimate state

1859
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,760
reverse engineer value value-driven

1860
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,720
assessment of optimal control that's a

1861
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,280
quite

1862
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,920
different layout for cognition this is

1863
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,079
the one that's consistent with a sense

1864
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,280
think act loop because

1865
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,559
in that think as a separable module

1866
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,039
you get state estimators how else would

1867
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,160
you translate

1868
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,720
from the perception to the action well

1869
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,920
in active inference

1870
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,160
we kind of have an answer for that at

1871
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,440
least we have a model

1872
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,920
framework that helps us get at it

1873
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,359
anything to add on the figure or we'll

1874
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,119
continue to how it challenges okay great

1875
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:57,920
so

1876
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,200
how does active inference challenge omct

1877
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,520
either of you want to say something on

1878
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,319
this one

1879
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:11,920
so since i made this slide i liked this

1880
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,240
um comparison and these two like

1881
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,839
sentences really kind of stuck out for

1882
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:16,559
me

1883
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,920
um so in the omct which is linear

1884
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,000
quadratic gaussian control that's this

1885
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,880
lqg model that i'm going to mention so

1886
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,720
it says this means that the canonical

1887
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,359
controls

1888
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,680
generated by the lqg models cannot

1889
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,960
reduce or even

1890
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
increase a system's uncertainty in the

1891
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,160
future

1892
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,039
i.e actions can only be instrumental and

1893
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:37,760
have no

1894
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,240
epistemic effect on future state

1895
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,280
estimates

1896
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,359
so i thought that that's kind of really

1897
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,400
nailing at

1898
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,359
what's the fundamental thing that omct

1899
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,880
doesn't do that active inference is

1900
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,760
going to allow for

1901
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,200
so it says with active inference the

1902
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,039
core idea then is rather than

1903
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,599
select an explicit motor command the

1904
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,240
organism

1905
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,319
infers what it must be doing under the

1906
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,240
assumption that what it must

1907
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,280
that what it does must minimize

1908
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,520
prediction error so there is that room

1909
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,119
to reduce uncertainty in the active

1910
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,400
inference model i just thought that was

1911
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,359
an important distinction

1912
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,720
dean anything on that no i think i think

1913
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,520
blue

1914
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,640
thanks for throwing that in there

1915
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,119
because i think one of the things

1916
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,280
that we have to sort of address is

1917
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,640
do do all actions follow commands

1918
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,799
i think the active inference says no we

1919
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,680
can act first

1920
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,319
yep as opposed to always following some

1921
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,680
sort of a prompt

1922
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,440
and i think that's this this slide

1923
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,200
really spells that out clearly

1924
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,760
yeah and this piece right here is that

1925
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,119
about how actions can only be

1926
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,160
instrumental and have

1927
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,559
no epistemic effect so you need a total

1928
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,480
bolted-on second layer in a value-driven

1929
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,880
and value-evaluated model of motor

1930
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,520
behavior

1931
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,160
you need a second layer to explain play

1932
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:58,960
to explain

1933
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,160
exploratory behavior curiosity and just

1934
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:02,960
like sort of

1935
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,079
not caring that much whereas in active

1936
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:06,640
inference

1937
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,720
those are natural attributes of our

1938
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,640
fundamental model

1939
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,079
okay i think i think the omct

1940
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,640
naturally constrains us if you're if

1941
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,559
you're in the business of learning

1942
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,480
it would be great because then everybody

1943
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,160
would have to follow

1944
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,559
there would be no other option but to

1945
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,760
follow

1946
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,359
but i think what active inference does

1947
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,960
is say it takes the lid off that

1948
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,319
says no i can model

1949
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,359
first there there's nothing to follow

1950
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,760
i'm not stuck

1951
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,359
that reminds me almost of like the

1952
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,720
teacher is the person who could get a

1953
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,280
100

1954
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
on the test so i'm up here on the top of

1955
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,960
the mountain come on

1956
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,240
75 is is okay 76 is better

1957
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,319
come on one by one let's just let's go

1958
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:51,839
over the questions you got wrong

1959
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,880
so that you can get them right right

1960
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,599
where does that come into play visually

1961
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,480
so

1962
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,039
sorry for the uh slightly busy slide

1963
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,039
earlier versions were even busier

1964
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,200
um active inference framework

1965
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,119
comprehensively challenges the optimal

1966
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,319
control theoretic

1967
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,200
approach to sensory motor behavior in

1968
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,880
particular the idea

1969
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,158
in traditional omct is that behavior can

1970
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,198
only

1971
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,238
basically you can evaluate the

1972
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,520
performance of different behaviors with

1973
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,719
a single number

1974
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,960
a scalar that is defined and tracked by

1975
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,319
a value function

1976
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,080
so this is sort of a traditional hill

1977
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,600
climber approach

1978
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,359
like if you want to get to the top of

1979
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,960
the mountain then

1980
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,799
the higher up the mountain you are the

1981
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,399
better it is the more value

1982
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,198
of that state so here's an agent on

1983
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,080
landscape

1984
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,719
and it's going to kind of take a ruler

1985
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:41,759
and then it's going to

1986
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,319
look at where it is locally and then

1987
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,000
it's going to follow uphill it's like a

1988
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,640
greedy

1989
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,679
value pursuing agent whereas an active

1990
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:50,640
inference

1991
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,080
it actually draws on thermodynamics and

1992
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,279
information flows

1993
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,799
as suggested earlier to take the total

1994
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,319
current the total flow and separate it

1995
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,359
into two components one of those

1996
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,198
is value so you still do get exactly

1997
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,198
a separable component from the total

1998
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,719
flow that represents

1999
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,000
that ruler going uphill

2000
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,198
but there's also a

2001
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,479
vector that is like resting on that

2002
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,439
ruler but going at a flat it's an iso

2003
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,080
contour

2004
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,198
it's kind of like when you look at a

2005
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,920
topo map for going hiking

2006
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,238
and that is what

2007
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,359
oh yep that's the um the physics of flow

2008
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,679
embedded in active inference show that

2009
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,759
motion in a biologically realistic state

2010
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,600
irreducibly includes two orthogonal

2011
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,120
kinds of motion so those

2012
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,960
two rulers again one is going on

2013
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,560
whatever the angle is of the hill

2014
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,080
and the other one is going on the flat

2015
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,679
part those are going to be

2016
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,839
always like orthogonal to each other

2017
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,080
like at a 90 degree cross

2018
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,320
so there's an irrotational curl free

2019
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,199
component

2020
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,840
that's which movement will take me just

2021
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,960
locally

2022
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,960
up the hill and then there's a

2023
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,159
solenoidal

2024
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,239
or a divergence-free component that

2025
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,679
circulates you

2026
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,960
on the same elevation

2027
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,640
the curl free component allows the flow

2028
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,080
to climb a gradient towards more

2029
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:16,719
valuable

2030
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,280
or probable states the solenoidal

2031
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,000
component

2032
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,159
specifies a flow around an iso

2033
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,239
probability contour where all entered

2034
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,679
states have an equal value or

2035
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,640
probability

2036
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,880
so there is an iso contour for this

2037
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,080
agent on the left

2038
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,040
but it's not calculating or tracking it

2039
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,400
in active inference

2040
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,040
we could turn the knob so that it just

2041
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,640
pursues value

2042
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,679
but we also have a framework for that

2043
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,120
sort of play

2044
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,520
and who on the rugged landscape is going

2045
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,960
to get to the top of the hill

2046
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,120
an agent that's able to switch back and

2047
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,080
forth

2048
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,800
or you know shade between these

2049
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,159
different ways of working

2050
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,600
it's like you climb up and then you're

2051
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,199
at the top of a local peak

2052
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,400
and then can you circulate a little bit

2053
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,239
um so that is part of how information

2054
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:04,880
theory

2055
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
and information flows play in active

2056
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,480
inference let's take

2057
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,840
information flow from a sort of

2058
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,719
quantitative

2059
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,360
ontology of information flow like first

2060
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,159
in 2011

2061
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,520
and in this figure to this version of a

2062
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,120
flow state so i'm gonna play

2063
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,199
this video on repeat blue while you

2064
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,040
describe what you're excited about here

2065
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,280
cool so you know just upon reading like

2066
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,080
the title

2067
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,800
of the paper um skill performance i was

2068
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,360
like oh

2069
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,480
active inference we're going to talk

2070
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,400
about the flow state and i was like

2071
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,640
we got to flows but i kind of was left

2072
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,960
like wanting to talk about um the flow

2073
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,440
state

2074
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,120
and so this is like the preview from the

2075
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,640
disney movie soul

2076
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,199
uh where everybody has like their thing

2077
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,760
and they can

2078
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
you know jump into a flow state um and

2079
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,120
it's just showing funny parts from the

2080
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:51,760
movie

2081
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,960
of people who for people who have seen

2082
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,120
it or not um it's very cute

2083
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,960
but but in that flow state which i think

2084
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,159
we've all kind of

2085
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,800
experienced it is like the skilled

2086
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,520
performance

2087
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,960
where daniel and i were discussing

2088
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,719
earlier like you can just do things

2089
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,880
without thinking about them

2090
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,920
and so i was you know reminded of

2091
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,120
the um paper that we did toward a

2092
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,920
predictive global neuronal workspace

2093
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
um by chris white and ryan smith and

2094
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,199
that was stream

2095
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:22,320
18.0.1.2 if anybody wants to check it

2096
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:22,719
out

2097
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,040
but they're there they mapped um they

2098
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,800
built a model of the visual

2099
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,880
consciousness right and so we talked a

2100
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,400
little bit about consciousness

2101
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,120
and specifically phenomenological

2102
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,080
consciousness like

2103
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,440
where you're able to report like i

2104
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,920
saw a red bird or or whatever like you

2105
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920
can say i saw a red bird and we talked

2106
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,320
about

2107
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,280
in that um video how the model didn't

2108
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,239
apply for

2109
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,800
or it like for um inattentional

2110
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,480
blindness right it couldn't it couldn't

2111
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,600
account for

2112
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,440
when you see something but you can't

2113
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,280
report that you saw it right so you have

2114
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,159
to have this

2115
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,920
this phenomenological consequence or

2116
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,920
consciousness and so i was thinking

2117
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,760
about the flow state

2118
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,080
and really like is there like a motor

2119
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,080
consciousness like right like so

2120
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,920
you know i'm conscious that my feet are

2121
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,840
on the floor and like this is something

2122
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,000
for people who meditate like a lot of it

2123
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,920
is like awareness of the body and where

2124
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,440
the body is in space and so

2125
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,719
it's sometimes you can use

2126
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,040
proprioception there but

2127
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,960
am i conscious of where my body is where

2128
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,800
i want to put my body or

2129
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,440
can i just do it like is it like

2130
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,960
inattentional blindness like when you're

2131
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,320
in that flow state like when you're

2132
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,040
dancing

2133
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,800
you know like you don't you can't report

2134
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,159
like oh i did a pirouette

2135
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,320
and then you know or whatever like you

2136
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,920
can you can't

2137
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,560
verbally report what's happening with

2138
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:38,960
your

2139
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,000
motor consciousness in a a lot of times

2140
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,840
especially when you're in that like flow

2141
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,199
state so is that like

2142
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,199
similar maybe to inattentional blindness

2143
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:48,400
anyway it's just something that i was

2144
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,120
thinking about

2145
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,960
um and i think that there's an

2146
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,719
interesting contrast between the way

2147
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,920
that this paper

2148
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,719
models the motor active inference versus

2149
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,159
the visual active inference

2150
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:01,280
that was modeled in that paper and it

2151
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,400
almost reminds me of

2152
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,239
like a sports you know or like a

2153
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,480
trackmate and sometimes the reporter

2154
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,000
okay how does that feel you just won the

2155
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,600
game

2156
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,400
the athlete just their body says it all

2157
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,159
or the performance says it all and it's

2158
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:14,719
like

2159
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,960
and then and then what and it's like as

2160
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,640
if they were running alongside trying to

2161
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,760
get the play-by-play

2162
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,159
from the person who's actually in the

2163
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:23,120
action

2164
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,800
they're not going to be able to report

2165
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,480
it in the same way it breaks them out of

2166
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,840
the flow state

2167
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,400
to have to verbally represent it which

2168
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,040
is why

2169
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,199
in sports commentary sometimes you have

2170
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,960
like a conversation happening

2171
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,520
between like the more maybe pragmatic or

2172
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,480
descriptive

2173
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,960
representation and then a more like

2174
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,560
color commentary

2175
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,679
because that plays both roles of

2176
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,360
giving the information about what is

2177
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,440
happening but also some of that

2178
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,920
excitement and connecting the dots but

2179
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,199
the person you can't ask

2180
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,960
in the moment is the one who's actually

2181
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,120
doing the action

2182
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,760
so that's cool yeah yeah often times

2183
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,640
wondered if

2184
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,120
after one of these performances the

2185
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,960
reporter got the response well here's my

2186
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,960
physiological state

2187
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,360
i think that would be awesome right now

2188
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,520
i'm just feeling like my right knee is

2189
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,760
i can't move it anymore and then they

2190
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,640
just

2191
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,159
dropped the mic and walked away right

2192
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,320
there's my tooth drop

2193
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,239
nice maybe in the future they'll be

2194
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:24,000
wearing you know physiological sensors

2195
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,040
and that'll say it all right

2196
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,679
so what does active inference sort of in

2197
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:30,480
closing here

2198
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,800
what is being added or contributed by

2199
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,320
active inference

2200
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,159
well it's a formal model of motor

2201
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:37,440
control

2202
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,560
it helps us understand online

2203
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,640
no not like this live stream like real

2204
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,800
time motor adaptation to

2205
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,520
an environment and thinks about that

2206
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,120
environment in terms of a

2207
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,840
um not necessarily symmetric but

2208
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,600
bi-directional relationship between

2209
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,199
agent and environment

2210
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,199
and brunberg and constant and many other

2211
01:15:59,199 --> 01:15:59,760
papers

2212
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,560
have explored this interface and that's

2213
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,040
been

2214
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,560
just the tip of the iceberg of the

2215
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,920
richness in terms of thinking

2216
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,120
bi-directionally like in the

2217
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,080
value-driven

2218
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,080
motor control they didn't even mention

2219
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,760
the environment they didn't mention

2220
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,520
generative models of the niche

2221
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,440
or having a second person who you're

2222
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,360
playing with or an adversary or a

2223
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,320
collaborator

2224
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,120
it was very much internal and value

2225
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,840
driven

2226
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,400
and active inference blows the lid open

2227
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,400
to play and collaboration and

2228
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,960
a niche that's rich with rich models of

2229
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,920
it

2230
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,760
and the tight and reciprocal

2231
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,360
relationship between

2232
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,040
action and perception in active

2233
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,280
inference resonates with other

2234
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,560
key ideas related to embodied inactive

2235
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,080
embedded and cultured extended eeee

2236
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,960
approaches to cognition and agency any

2237
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,360
adjective we like all the letters

2238
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,239
but there's a whole area of sort of

2239
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,440
critiques that

2240
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,800
um swirled and eventually coalesced

2241
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,040
that critiqued a sort of narrow

2242
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,480
computationalist

2243
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,880
framing of cognition and active

2244
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,920
inference is almost

2245
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,800
bringing these threads back together by

2246
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,520
helping us have computational models

2247
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,920
that respect the richness and the

2248
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,840
embodiment in the world

2249
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,360
but we're only steps down that

2250
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,400
pathway in terms of where it can go

2251
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,199
and in the end where the authors take us

2252
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:23,520
is

2253
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,560
towards a focus on interactions not

2254
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,440
instructions and say that the

2255
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,159
interactionist account portrays skill as

2256
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,560
enacted without needing to assume it's

2257
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,000
driven by instructions

2258
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,040
that are implicitly couched in terms of

2259
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,760
the content

2260
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,920
of what is being represented you know

2261
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,040
you can't say

2262
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,360
pick up the arm so the knife is higher

2263
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,040
without having a state estimate of where

2264
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,360
the arm is and where the knife is

2265
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,440
and their alternative interactionist

2266
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,600
account for skilled performance

2267
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,880
achieves this resolution

2268
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,000
this improvement by avoiding two sets of

2269
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,960
commitments

2270
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,360
so for those who are commitment phobic

2271
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,320
active inference is great for you

2272
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
um it doesn't assume that generative

2273
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,560
models used in active inference are the

2274
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,640
models that are used by the organisms or

2275
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,920
systems themselves

2276
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,239
this is kind of the instrumental way of

2277
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:16,960
thinking

2278
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,120
we don't need to say that's what the

2279
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,719
organism is doing

2280
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,000
we don't need to have a debate whether

2281
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,920
birds know where their wings are

2282
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,440
or what they think about what it's like

2283
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,840
to be a bird we can just have a framing

2284
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,120
that helps us understand

2285
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,679
how they act in the world and also the

2286
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,280
second commitment avoided by active

2287
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,320
inference

2288
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,120
is and more importantly for their

2289
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,800
discussions about representation

2290
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,679
and instructions they do not assume that

2291
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,360
the explanatory story

2292
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,440
that's offered by sensory motor accounts

2293
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,800
needs to posit any

2294
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,159
causally efficacious mediating knowledge

2295
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,080
so you don't need to propose that

2296
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,520
there's some sort of kernel

2297
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,920
of knowledge that then gets enacted

2298
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,880
through

2299
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,480
a command you have an account that just

2300
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,640
sidesteps that it doesn't say it doesn't

2301
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,760
exist it's just

2302
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,440
there's another way of framing what is

2303
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,080
happening so

2304
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,520
i'll go to this closing slide and we can

2305
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,360
actually provide our last

2306
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,080
thoughts so what would a good

2307
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,880
understanding

2308
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,560
enable here we actually we didn't have

2309
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,159
the um

2310
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,400
big questions and why it matters slide

2311
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,000
here because we kind of went

2312
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,719
through and through but um what would a

2313
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,000
good understanding

2314
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,480
enable like and this is an open question

2315
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,159
for those listening and also for the

2316
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,520
authors like

2317
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,760
why does it matter what would we be

2318
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,120
enabling ourselves to do

2319
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,600
if we had a better way or a different

2320
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,239
way

2321
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,480
of thinking about skilled performance

2322
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,280
can everybody

2323
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,880
play classical music or is there going

2324
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,800
to be some other implication

2325
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,560
what are the unique predictions and

2326
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,880
implications so for those who

2327
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,760
say hey i don't think omct is knocked

2328
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,880
out yet

2329
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,480
what is the differentiator what's the

2330
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,400
experiment or the test

2331
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,800
that we can actually do to see where

2332
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,679
active inference

2333
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:02,159
is coming into play what are the next

2334
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,360
steps for us

2335
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,560
as a research community and what are the

2336
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,040
goals

2337
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,199
of skilled performance research and of

2338
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,960
course what are you still

2339
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,239
curious about so any closing thoughts

2340
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,320
here

2341
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,080
well i'll just give one i want to thank

2342
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,360
both of you guys for keeping this

2343
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,159
grounded because

2344
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,560
so many times i could have flown off on

2345
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,400
this but one of the things i do want to

2346
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,400
i'm going to want to ask the authors

2347
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
about is i do think that there is a

2348
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,800
place for

2349
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,480
construction it's but it's a tiny

2350
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,480
it's a fragment of the total memory

2351
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,560
sphere and it's to do with perspective

2352
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,360
memory

2353
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,840
where if i don't remember to bring the

2354
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,199
milk home

2355
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,840
when i'm driving home from work i am

2356
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,040
going to get in trouble

2357
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,960
because i forgot to to carry out a side

2358
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,400
action in the in the continuum of

2359
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,080
i have to come home from work today but

2360
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,679
i can't forget to bring

2361
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,480
a quart of milk home with me so i do

2362
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,560
think that there is a part for this

2363
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,040
this instructionist piece in the memory

2364
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,000
scape

2365
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
but i don't think it should be the total

2366
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,199
picture so i'm going to want to ask the

2367
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,280
authors about that

2368
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,800
perfect and that's a theme that we've

2369
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,639
seen come up which is like

2370
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,120
just because active inference is awesome

2371
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,040
doesn't mean it's our only

2372
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,719
tool in the toolbox so like even earlier

2373
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,719
today we were hearing about how

2374
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,040
active inference models can then be used

2375
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:29,920
as input

2376
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,840
into a just totally different kind of

2377
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,199
model to

2378
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,199
draw on the strengths of both so it

2379
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,800
could be possible that

2380
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,639
there's things that are described well

2381
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:39,840
by active inference

2382
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
and then there's a rapper that is almost

2383
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,760
instructionist

2384
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,920
so like people could give instructions

2385
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,120
pick up your hand and then the person

2386
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:47,840
does it

2387
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,000
so was that not an instruction i mean

2388
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,360
what does instruction mean if that's not

2389
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,239
an instruction

2390
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,239
so how do we combine active inference

2391
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:58,239
models with other kinds of models blue

2392
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,800
yeah i mean that's a great question too

2393
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,960
and i i also think about

2394
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,840
um i don't know really like where

2395
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,600
where like the model fits in and

2396
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,280
really just like what i was think what i

2397
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,480
was talking about earlier about like

2398
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,600
phenomenological

2399
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,080
consciousness like if i intend to do

2400
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,120
something is that

2401
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,440
like do intentions matter do beliefs and

2402
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,960
desires and intentions

2403
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,000
like matter um sometimes but like also

2404
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,560
like if

2405
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,000
you know a tennis ball is flying at my

2406
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,360
face and i reach my hand up and catch it

2407
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,440
like without thinking

2408
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,120
like that's like a very like i just

2409
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,520
a perception action a perception action

2410
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,120
like just happened all at the same time

2411
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,600
right

2412
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,560
so is there space for for the thought um

2413
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
about the action

2414
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,560
or is it always i don't know i'm still

2415
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,440
squishy like

2416
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,600
where does that we're just thinking

2417
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,360
about doing something

2418
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,880
fit into the active inference loop

2419
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,080
because sometimes you think about it and

2420
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,320
sometimes you don't

2421
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,520
sometimes you you rehearse you know you

2422
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,600
you uh think about think about it and

2423
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,560
then you

2424
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,960
choke or you don't other times there's

2425
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,600
like i mean famously captured by

2426
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,920
viral videos since the beginning of time

2427
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,199
you know somebody does like an

2428
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,480
incredibly

2429
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,199
amazing maneuver that they certainly

2430
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,480
didn't plan

2431
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,679
and they didn't have knowledge of and

2432
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,600
they probably could never do it twice

2433
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,639
so it's awesome to have a framework that

2434
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,000
covers potentially

2435
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,199
our autonomic reflexes all the way

2436
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,719
up perhaps to culturally infused and

2437
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,239
trained performance

2438
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,000
and enables us to think about how

2439
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,440
pre-play and replay

2440
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,840
of motor actions come into effect but

2441
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,040
also those

2442
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,760
america's home videos moments where

2443
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,560
something

2444
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,639
amazing just happens or something in

2445
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,800
sports where something amazing happens

2446
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,639
and you look at the replay it's like

2447
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,159
what

2448
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,480
how did that happen and the answer is

2449
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,159
they didn't know it was going to happen

2450
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,760
so right there it couldn't have been

2451
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,679
knowledge driven

2452
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,920
can i uh one last thing daniel for at

2453
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,199
least for me yeah

2454
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,520
again thanks blue for for putting in the

2455
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,320
uh

2456
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,600
the little clip about flow there because

2457
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,199
i would like to find out if somebody

2458
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,199
actually identifies by the sequence of

2459
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,120
commands that they carried out like

2460
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,360
if i carried out a set of instructions

2461
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,639
would i identify

2462
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,840
myself now as the carrier out of those

2463
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,320
commands

2464
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,000
or is my identity more about

2465
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,120
those those aspects of

2466
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,840
how i sort of move through

2467
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,360
through time and change along with it

2468
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,560
because if it is i guess if i could see

2469
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,320
myself as being identified by

2470
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,560
the instructions i carried out then i

2471
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,679
guess optimal motor control theory

2472
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,239
would be the whole thing but until

2473
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,920
somebody shows me that that's

2474
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,719
actually how i identify i think we re i

2475
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:53,840
think we have to sort of

2476
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,159
take it off that deflated sense and

2477
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,920
inflate it up to the identity piece and

2478
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,120
see the interstate for what it is

2479
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,760
i'll close with a borjess quote inspired

2480
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,320
by dean

2481
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:11,280
time is the substance i am made of time

2482
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,600
is a river which sweeps me along but i

2483
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,400
am the river

2484
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,480
it is a tiger which destroys me but i am

2485
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,960
the tiger it is a fire which consumes me

2486
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,040
but i am the fire

2487
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,560
there you go perfect thank you everybody

2488
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,960
for watching we hope to see you

2489
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,400
participating soon
