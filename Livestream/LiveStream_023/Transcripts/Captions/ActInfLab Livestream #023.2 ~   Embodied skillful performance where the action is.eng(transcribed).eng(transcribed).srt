00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,240
greetings everyone

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,160
welcome to actin flab live stream number

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
23.2

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
today is june 15th 2021

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,560
and we're going to be having our dot 2

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,279
discussion

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,080
on embodied skillful performance where

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,519
the action is

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399
and we'll see who else joins us live as

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,520
we

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,239
go through the slides in the paper and

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,360
also of course

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
if you're watching live we'd welcome any

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,559
questions or comments

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
welcome to the active inference lab

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,120
everyone we are a participatory

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,600
online lab that is communicating

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,239
learning

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,879
and practicing applied active inference

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,760
you can find us

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
at the links that are on this slide this

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
is recorded greetings dave

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
you this is a recorded and an archived

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
live stream so please provide us with

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
feedback so that we can improve our work

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
all backgrounds and perspectives are

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
welcome here

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
and we'll be following good video

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
etiquette for live streams

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
we're again on june 15th having our

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,920
second

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
group discussion on embodied skillful

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
performance where the action is

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
so this is sort of our jumping off point

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,080
and let's see if we can

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
make it a skillful one today the goals

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,960
are really just to be

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
discussing and learning to be hearing

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
the questions and points that people

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,600
found really interesting when they were

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
reading the paper as well as

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,680
see where our discussion can

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,799
spontaneously

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
go as of course participants join

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,479
and leave and hopefully we get some fun

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
questions from the chat

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
and we're just going to walk through the

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,079
paper

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
and the slides go where we need to go

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
to hopefully connect some dots

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
so with that being said let's just go to

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
the introductions

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
and warm-ups and we can each just give

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,600
an

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,720
introductory thought on the paper if we

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,280
would like

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
or something we liked or remembered

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
something we're looking to

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
resolve reduce our uncertainty on by the

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
end of the discussion

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,239
so i'm daniel i'm a postdoctoral

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:22,959
researcher

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,440
in california and all passed to dean

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,800
hi i'm dean i'm in calgary and

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
i'm becoming a more

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,879
embedded personality in this active

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
inference lab

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
world and i'll pass it over to stephen

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
i'm doing a practice based phd through

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
the uk i'm interested in um

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
participatory theater community

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
development and ways to understand

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
how people interact with each other uh

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
in groups and individually so

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
this paper is quite relevant as it opens

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
up some new avenues in that

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
and i will pass it over to

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
is it is dave here dave hello dave

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
yeah dave if you can speak otherwise

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
no worries maybe you're just listening

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,640
in

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
so maybe just a quick question stephen

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,560
where do we

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
see the connection between skillful

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
performance which is often thought of

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,879
like motor and bodily

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
how do we connect that to social

89
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,480
practices which are

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
amongst bodies and use verbal behavior

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:35,840
or

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
symbolic behavior yeah i mean

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
this is this is kind of a question i

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
think that's arising more and more as

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
people are trying to question

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,799
psychology or community psychology which

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,400
works on the individual

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
or sociology which works on this sort of

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
mass of people

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,400
but when you want to work with

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,760
intersubjectivity and sort of small

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,640
groups

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
and understanding the dynamics that are

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
going on there

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
you could kind of ask phenomenological

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,439
questions about what it's like

107
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,080
to be in that state which is kind of a

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
bit more

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
direct than say someone's psychological

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,920
perspective on it but it's still not

111
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
quite working so then you say well let's

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
get into action here let's get into

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
what's actually happening in and amongst

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
people

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,919
um and often if you then jump into

116
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
action that's another abstracted

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
area but if you're in the area of

118
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,199
practice

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,120
um you're kind of in a in between

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
you know it's something that people are

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
doing something that people are doing

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,080
between each other

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
and but you're still able to talk about

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
how it's happening

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,520
how it feels um so i think that um

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
that this this question of practice then

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
you know takes you into the sort of

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
areas that get used a lot in arts

129
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
arts practice theater practice all these

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
types of areas so

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
um i think it's quite a a nice nexus

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
that's normally a bit impenetrable cool

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
it makes me wonder do groups

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
have skill or is skill something that

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
only

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
bodies have so you see some football

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
team or basketball team do some very

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,240
coordinated play

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
or two dancers that are improvising is

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
that

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
able to be reduced entirely to the

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
skilled embodied performance

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,320
of individual bodies or is there

144
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
a way in which we could talk about a

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
group embodying

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
skillful performance especially because

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,160
so many performances i mean except for

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
what stand-up comedy a few other things

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
their group and then even those

150
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,400
individual performances are in feedback

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
sometimes

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,680
with a group it's just different roles

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
um that's a good point actually i mean i

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
think that's really the exciting

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
field of practice that's going to be

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
growing over the next while

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,039
and i i sense that it's almost

158
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,840
impossible to get that from a snapshot

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
you have to have something that's been

160
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
progressing over time to get

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
or let's just say i don't know whether

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
that's true but i

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
i sense that there's more use in

164
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
understanding how things change over

165
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,280
time

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
and getting the dynamics than there is

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
trying to analyze a snapshot

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,560
uh dave if you have any comments you can

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
unmute and i'll

170
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
see it or dean any sort of just opening

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,840
thoughts how does this dot 2 meet you

172
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,039
today

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
well i'm going to come from it from a

174
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,400
little different angle i

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,680
so i think that word between is a huge

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
is it it's the thing that that befuddles

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,520
us and yet it's the thing that we

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
probably want to know the most about

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
and um in this idea of

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
embodied skill for skillful performance

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
i was going to actually ask the author

182
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
some questions around how she relates it

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,639
back to sort of

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
the poor the parts of the brain that um

185
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
resolve these problems so is it a

186
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
spatial relationship thing like what the

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
hippocampus

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
tends to provide us some insight on or

189
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,800
is it a

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
caudate nucleus thing which says that we

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
sequence everything out and we turn left

192
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,199
we turn right we

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
release the ball and i was just curious

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
about which

195
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
because those two those two things work

196
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
but when one is on the other one is off

197
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,520
there's kind of a binary relationship

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
between those two parts of the brain and

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,280
so i wanted to kind of figure out

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
how that that toggling back and forth is

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,880
part of

202
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
this skill that we are witnessing

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
nice point there's um the more

204
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,759
cognitively driven versus almost the

205
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,440
more bodily

206
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,879
driven and then that handoff is where we

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,840
see

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
skillful performance and that's where we

209
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
see choking it's where we see all these

210
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,639
dynamics between cognitive processes and

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
action processes

212
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
okay we see another dave dave if you can

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,759
if you want to give any thoughts just

214
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,120
feel free

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
um yeah oh just listening and thanks

216
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,400
nice

217
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
right on that's the real that's the real

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
og way to listen in

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,319
in the jitsi rather than in the live

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
stream

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,919
um yeah so we'll see who else

222
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,760
joins in today but that's a great

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
question about the brain pieces and then

224
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,279
i always think about other species like

225
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
if insects can have

226
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
embodied action and that seems pretty

227
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
fair to say

228
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
can they have skillful action and how

229
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
would we know

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
and then if they do the layout of their

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
brain and body

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
is so different that it wouldn't map on

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
you know they don't have a hippocampus

234
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
they don't have a prefrontal cortex they

235
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,399
have other

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,760
brain regions so we don't need to get

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,080
too

238
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
locked into one implementation of these

239
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
processes based upon human neuroanatomy

240
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,839
when we know that there's other neural

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,800
anatomies

242
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
that can deploy similar

243
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
processes so it helps us

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
keep an open mind the multiple

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
realizations

246
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,880
of active inference or of embodied

247
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
skillful performance because of just the

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,479
diversity of evolutionary systems

249
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
let's take an overview at the roadmap

250
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
this paper has a form that we've

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
seen several times before which is

252
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
in the first half taking

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
some non-active inference body of

254
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
research so in this case it's skillful

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,160
performance

256
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,279
and optimal motor control theory and

257
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,000
investigating with a critical lens this

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
previous body of research

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
to understand what is it really saying

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
or what are the assumptions

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
so in this case there's this

262
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
instructionist assumption

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
implicitly or explicitly that's drawn

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,320
out

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
through the exploration of previous

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
approaches to skillful performance

267
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
and specifically the motor

268
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
representations and motor commands that

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
are implicit

270
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,079
in optimal motor control theory so

271
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,880
that's

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
part one part two

273
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
goes from optimal control to predictive

274
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
coding and

275
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,880
active inference and last time we talked

276
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
a little bit about similarities and

277
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
differences

278
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
as you go from optimal motor control to

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
predictive processing

280
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
to active inference what is generalized

281
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
as you move from a to b to c

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
what is different what kinds of issues

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
might you stick or

284
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,399
introduce and then in the

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
last sections of the paper motor control

286
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
is positively reframed as this

287
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
interactive

288
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
sensory motor engagement with the world

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
which puts us very squarely

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
in the domain of active inference rather

291
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
than in the instructionist domain of

292
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
optimal motor control theory

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
greetings blue so that's kind of a

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
general pattern that we've seen before

295
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,320
where the first third of the paper is a

296
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,399
background on previous approaches

297
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
in a critical lens the second approach

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
shows some sort of a transition

299
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
from theory a to b to c and then by the

300
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,920
third part

301
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,640
there's a positive positivist argument

302
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
as to why active inference is

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
more in line with how things are or

304
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
might be more useful

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
uh steven go ahead

306
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
so yeah further to our conversation

307
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,880
earlier um

308
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
i think this actually this this showing

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
the instructionist and then the

310
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
interactive

311
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,640
approach is really useful to sort of

312
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
have a plausible way for

313
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,200
affect and social dynamics

314
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
to interplay with action because when

315
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
it's under an instructionist model

316
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,279
it is kind of hard to imagine how that

317
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,320
kind of

318
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
mechanical almost message passing type

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
of approach can

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
integrate into our sort of social

321
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
dynamics whereas

322
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
um the interaction in this approach

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,360
does give that so i think that's quite

324
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
good

325
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
it can frighten people off because it

326
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
brings in this other

327
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
philosophical piece which i think a lot

328
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,839
of people would like

329
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
running away from at first but actually

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
it does

331
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,800
offer a more humorous humanizing or

332
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,880
biological way to engage

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
cool let's just go there blue of course

334
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,839
raise your hand anytime you want to add

335
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
something but this

336
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
instructionism versus interactionism

337
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,360
i think is a big piece that we'll walk

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
away from this

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,440
uh 23 width it's something that we can

340
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,519
take on in the case of embodied skillful

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,800
performance but i think we're going to

342
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
be able to apply it

343
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
to education we're going to be able to

344
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
apply it to team collaboration

345
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
and so we can definitely return to this

346
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
distinction between instructionism

347
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,680
and interactionism so steven just from

348
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
you know your experience with drama or

349
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
other

350
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,839
kinds of work do you think people are

351
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,360
how do people implicitly use

352
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
instructionism versus interactionism or

353
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
what kinds of scenarios

354
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
uh support or constrain instructionism

355
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,959
versus

356
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,399
allow for interactions to emerge

357
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
well i think what tends to happen is in

358
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,560
the models that people tend to use

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
they're kind of either in one

360
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839
camp or another it's like so mostly

361
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,720
it's almost implicit that there's some

362
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,000
sort of

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
interactive stroke flow it probably goes

364
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
even further it's sort of some sort of

365
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,040
flow

366
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
in the sort of performance arts world

367
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,800
they talk about flow

368
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
and ease and that type of thing and

369
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
what's also interesting is i know they

370
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,959
talk about this in the michael chekhov

371
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,279
acting approach is there's always this

372
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
battle between

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,040
ease and form so a dancer gets more form

374
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
they get more technique they get more

375
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
proficient their technique

376
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,639
but they might lose their ease that you

377
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,680
have as a beginner

378
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
so you're forever trying to add more

379
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
technique

380
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
without becoming this kind of rigid

381
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
autumn automaton

382
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,519
you know so i think there's there's that

383
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,040
kind of side to it and

384
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,760
and that that whole area they just go

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,079
off

386
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,000
and it's it's kind of it just takes care

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
of itself but it becomes a little bit

388
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,600
um of a silo in a way

389
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
and then you've got people working in

390
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,839
more straight activity theory

391
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,639
veikovsky kind of much more like

392
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,480
what activity happened when um and that

393
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
they they they are also in a bit of a

394
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,760
silo

395
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,639
so i think that you tend to find that

396
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,519
and

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,160
different different areas they they are

398
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
a little bit siloed in their approaches

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,199
um to sort of get around some of these

400
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,240
um

401
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
challenges um so i think that

402
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,519
the way of trying to break

403
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,279
beyond what you can analyze which often

404
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,240
you have to look at

405
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
instructionally because you kind of have

406
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
to break down things into steps

407
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
but that doesn't mean you need to keep

408
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,839
it in

409
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
a stepwise form in terms of how we

410
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
understand

411
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
what people really do so there's this

412
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,480
kind of i think there's this kind of gap

413
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,959
that this will help to make plausible

414
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,320
interesting there how we capture

415
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,279
the utility and the apparent advantages

416
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,880
of instructionism

417
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
some of them are written here like the

418
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
ability to separate different

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
instructions that seems

420
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
pretty important if you say well how am

421
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
i going to cook this multi-stage dish

422
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
and someone just says you know here's

423
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,560
all the ingredients and here's all the

424
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
behaviors but i'm not going to tell you

425
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
what order to do what in

426
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,680
if we can't separate and sequence events

427
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
then it's going to be hard to carry out

428
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
a performance correctly you can't just

429
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
switch the order of musical notes and

430
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,560
the sheet music

431
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,920
you can't just do things in a different

432
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
order so how do we get

433
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,759
some of the features that we're looking

434
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,959
for

435
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,600
like separability and modularity and

436
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
take it into a fully interactionist

437
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
framework one distinction there

438
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
that the authors raise is like strong

439
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,120
versus weak instructionism

440
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,199
and they'll um end up continuing

441
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
that both of these forms have similar

442
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,600
underpinnings

443
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,079
but there's sort of uh a continuum

444
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
between thinking that the instructionism

445
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
is completely its own neural

446
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
representationism

447
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,120
it's kind of like a mott and bailey type

448
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
argument this is the strong

449
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
instructionism

450
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
thinking that it's totally just the

451
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,880
neural representations

452
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
that are entirely specifying on their

453
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,000
own

454
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
the movements that have to be performed

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
versus

456
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
a more dynamical coupling version of

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
instructionisms

458
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,679
so that'd be like you know when you're

459
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
tapping the gas it's like an instruction

460
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,799
to the engine but it's not the entire

461
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,919
um go faster cue

462
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,599
given the background of ecologically

463
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
normal processes that enable them to

464
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,160
play

465
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
this role so that's kind of interesting

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
um blue any sort of overarching thoughts

467
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
or anywhere you think it'd be fun to

468
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
jump in

469
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
no i'm just trying to figure out where

470
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
i'm at still

471
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
indeed um well there'll be a few other

472
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
places like a few other notes that we

473
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
wanted to discuss dean

474
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,960
mentioned um one thing maybe we can even

475
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
have a dot three

476
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,480
and find out what a dot three would uh

477
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,919
mean or dot two point

478
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
dot two one or something like that dot

479
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,799
twenty one um so one piece was about the

480
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
the neural elements because in the

481
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
figures

482
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
we do see brains

483
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
however um these are quite schematic

484
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,919
it's not saying that these are the brain

485
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,520
regions where

486
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
these types of things happen which can

487
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,120
be a little

488
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
uh ambiguous because it's not actually

489
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,559
an anatomical

490
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,039
representation yet it's superimposed on

491
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
top of a brain

492
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
um okay so one piece we wrote down was

493
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
about the neural

494
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
and i think there was a few um yeah oh

495
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
yeah stephen go for it

496
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
yeah just tying this as you mentioned

497
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,919
about the streak the weak and strong

498
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
um it's kind of interesting because

499
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
that's kind of trying to give this

500
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
scientific

501
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
feel but it doesn't feel very

502
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,320
satisfactory to

503
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
try and have to say it in terms of weak

504
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
and strong because you're kind of in

505
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,840
this

506
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,600
well what does that really mean and how

507
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,440
does it shift between the two i mean i

508
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,520
can understand what has been said

509
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
but um it's it gets into this kind of

510
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
fuzzy version of instructionism so i

511
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
i think that kind of sets up some of

512
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
these questions that as soon as you move

513
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,640
away from

514
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
a strong instructionism um

515
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
it becomes harder to hold it together

516
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
using the word instructionism

517
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
so i think that's it's quite a good

518
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
illustration of that

519
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
because it's sort of unraveled you can

520
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
see how the second paragraph's a lot

521
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
longer than the first one basically

522
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,400
yep great point and it's also a common

523
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
approach to basically rigorous

524
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,919
philosophical argument instead of making

525
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
an argument against a total category

526
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,160
you introduce a distinction in the

527
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
category and then

528
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
you might find that either one of those

529
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
categories has some feature that the

530
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
other one doesn't

531
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
you know instead of being against all

532
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
wars well there's the good ones and

533
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
there's the bad ones and then here's my

534
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
distinction for just the bad ones or it

535
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
could be that by making that distinction

536
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,280
you then can say actually this holds

537
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,640
true for both

538
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
of these categories or subcategories

539
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,000
and so that's how i've made my claim

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,360
against all x

541
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
is by first breaking it down and then

542
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,600
they do again

543
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
find that there of course are

544
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
differences between these two

545
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,000
forms of instructionism but that they

546
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
end up taking on some of the same

547
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
assumptions

548
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
um cool there's probably a few other

549
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,360
pieces we can explore

550
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,640
this is the section in the paper that

551
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,840
i'm

552
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,240
sharing on the screen that says the

553
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360
formulation

554
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
of sensory motor control in terms of

555
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
optimal motor control theory

556
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
heavily hinges on two different but

557
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
highly interconnected assumptions

558
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
so let's see what the assumptions are

559
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
because it's probable that

560
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
active inference is going to be

561
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
contrasting or doing something

562
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,720
different so one is the central

563
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
specification of descending motor

564
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
commands

565
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
and their efferent copies in the form of

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
detailed low-level instructions for

567
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
control

568
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
of the motor plant specified in terms of

569
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
an intrinsic

570
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
frame of reference i.e extension and

571
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
contraction of muscle

572
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,240
fibers so that's that instructionism

573
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,280
and then two a separation of forward and

574
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,799
inverse models

575
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,720
operating on complementary aspects of

576
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
action planning and executionism

577
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,559
so the first piece is that

578
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,919
instructionism that what's being sent

579
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
descending or towards the body are

580
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,559
instructions and the second piece is a

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,400
separation of the forward and the

582
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,039
inverse

583
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
models operating on complementary

584
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
aspects of action planning and execution

585
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
so the forward model is like sort of a

586
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,120
planning

587
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
model and then the execution is like

588
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
okay given what i planned

589
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
how am i going to execute that and those

590
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
are two different streams

591
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
in optimal motor control and so we've

592
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
been talking about how

593
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,600
interactionism we can explore how active

594
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,159
inference

595
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,320
deploys interactionism but in

596
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
interactionism we have a contrast with

597
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
the instructionist point

598
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,200
one and then through a unified

599
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,080
generative model in active and the

600
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
reduction of uncertainty in a unified

601
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
generative model

602
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
we're going to move beyond this

603
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
separation of these two

604
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,640
forward and inverse models stephen and

605
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,960
then

606
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
anyone else or any questions in the live

607
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
chat

608
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,919
yeah this is quite helpful it gives that

609
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,760
realization that optimal motor control

610
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
theory it could

611
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
it can be very precise you could imagine

612
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
someone making a robot because you can

613
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
measure everything you've got access to

614
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
all the data

615
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
and you could make something within like

616
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,520
a thousandth of a

617
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,559
millimeter precision which humans or

618
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,520
animals can't do

619
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,559
but it it does have a bit of a

620
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,760
limitation in terms of um

621
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
being able to integrate and i think that

622
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
i don't know if you've seen any of the

623
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
papers around

624
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
the idea of fields being around the

625
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
robot's

626
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,480
joints i have like a field around the

627
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,080
hand a field around the

628
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,880
and just move into the field rather than

629
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,520
trying to

630
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
work out what the actual must like the

631
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
actual joints should do

632
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
and they they out competed other robots

633
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,200
within like

634
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,440
two or three months so the same idea of

635
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,240
working with

636
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,520
some sort of more fuzzy um

637
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
dynamical field

638
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,280
actually and just working out what works

639
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,000
most

640
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
efficiently or best even though you're

641
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
probably adding a lot more fuzziness

642
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
into the actual

643
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,159
understanding of the measurements

644
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,039
actually has

645
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
a lot of them has a lot of benefits in

646
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
terms of

647
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,880
learning how to do something quickly

648
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,480
okay i think there'll be a few more cool

649
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
points to return to on this notion of

650
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,279
field

651
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
but i think it's also helpful here to

652
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
look at how they distinguish

653
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
the forward and the inverse

654
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,159
models so here a forward model

655
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
takes a system from an intrinsic to an

656
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,679
extrinsic frame

657
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
predicting the effects of different

658
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,799
movements

659
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
using musculoskeletal plans specified by

660
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
neural activity so again that's that

661
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
instructionism that's because we're in

662
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
the optimal motor control

663
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,520
so forward model is basically plans

664
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,159
that can be cognitive into

665
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,840
implementations

666
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
that's the translation into motor

667
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
commands and

668
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,080
their consequences on the other hand an

669
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,640
inverse

670
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
model builds motor commands by inverting

671
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
the causal change

672
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
so first that inverse model leverages a

673
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,320
value function of states

674
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
this is where we get the inoptimal motor

675
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,400
control

676
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
the non-negotiable introduction of value

677
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
as a central

678
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
heuristic states have to be assigned

679
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
value because value is what's used to

680
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,760
determine

681
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,039
which plans to select and that

682
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
leveraged on the value function is used

683
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,559
to form a mapping

684
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
from desired target states which

685
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,640
again is built into active inference in

686
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
a sense through the preference

687
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
over certain types of states but the

688
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,559
desired target state

689
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,240
has to be specified in a slightly

690
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,559
different way as an actual

691
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,320
preferred state rather than over a

692
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
preferences over states

693
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,120
in this optimal motor control framework

694
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
and that's in the coordinate system

695
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
based upon the external consequences of

696
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,279
movements

697
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,400
so i want my my arm to be at a 90 degree

698
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
angle and then that

699
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,240
is translated or it's mapped to a set of

700
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
intrinsic coordinates in the space of

701
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
muscle fiber activations like my arm is

702
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
at a greater than 90 degree angle

703
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
so that needs to map to activation of

704
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
bicep firing patterns so that the arm

705
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,159
can

706
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,360
contract so that the angle is smaller

707
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,039
and that's why frameworks based upon

708
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,720
optimal motor control are sometimes

709
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
characterized in terms of

710
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
force control because all the motor

711
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,159
commands specify

712
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
is muscle forces and joint torques so

713
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,000
that's kind of the macro

714
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,279
to micro mapping is we have preferred

715
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
states and the question is there's so

716
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,039
many degrees of freedom

717
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,679
with the joints so how do we go from

718
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,640
potentially a

719
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
broad set of preferred states or

720
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,640
acceptable states

721
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
into a specific pattern

722
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,400
of muscular activations so how do you go

723
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
from

724
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
make your hand just rest where it's

725
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,640
comfortable which is a relatively broad

726
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
sort of plateau of accessible states

727
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
into

728
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
a position that each joint is going to

729
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,159
be at equilibrium

730
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,600
with and the two of these

731
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
assumptions that we've been exploring

732
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,880
here so again

733
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
one the instructionism and two the

734
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
separation of forward and inverse model

735
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,880
that architecture induces the assumption

736
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
or rests on the assumption that value

737
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,760
valuable states is what causes action

738
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,720
and that's what that

739
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,840
first in 2011 paper introduced

740
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
is sort of flipped that on its head

741
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,520
which is that

742
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,919
well um in models from omct

743
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,360
sequences of action are selected

744
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
according to the value function of their

745
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,159
states

746
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,399
so value is something that's cognitive

747
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,399
and then induces action

748
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,440
but that gets sort of flipped

749
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
in the 2011 perspective because value is

750
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
a function of the states

751
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,719
not a cause of them so

752
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
as written here value is an attribute of

753
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,279
states that are caused by movement it's

754
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,480
a consequence

755
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,320
not a cause and when we get

756
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,120
loops you know which one's a cause of

757
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,600
which

758
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,559
something that's locally a causes b but

759
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:56,960
then

760
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,279
you pull back a level and maybe the

761
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,000
relationship

762
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
can also be seen as sort of the other

763
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
direction or

764
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,720
maybe with feedback systems or

765
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,159
embodied systems we move beyond just any

766
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
single linear framing of what causes

767
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,919
what

768
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,840
but regardless of the direction or

769
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,399
whether value is an attribute of states

770
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,960
or it's a consequence or it's a cause

771
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
the point is

772
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,760
there still is this central value

773
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
parameter in optimal motor control

774
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,799
theory

775
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,200
and that value parameter which is

776
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
familiar to reinforcement learning like

777
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
learning preferable states based upon

778
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,559
their predicted value

779
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,320
that's something that we're going to be

780
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,919
able to build on

781
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,720
in active inference by pursuing not just

782
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,360
value

783
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
but also allowing for reduction of

784
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,640
uncertainty

785
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
in a generative model which can include

786
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
pragmatic or value-driven elements but

787
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,919
also elements

788
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,799
that include curiosity like drives

789
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,440
steven

790
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
and then anyone else and this ties in

791
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,080
with kasper hess

792
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,440
work with affect you could imagine that

793
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
the affective states are kind of

794
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
generated

795
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,720
on the fly at different scales so as you

796
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
start to move maybe slowly as you

797
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,799
practice

798
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
you see that these value states are kind

799
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
of almost

800
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,159
revealed and not necessarily available

801
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,159
and then maybe there's a state

802
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,559
for once the whole action is complete

803
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,520
and that gives you

804
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
you know enter that value state which

805
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,679
maybe only appears

806
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,320
as that um degree of surprisal

807
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
is realized and it's always going to be

808
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
slightly different

809
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
each time you do something so this this

810
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,240
is quite cool

811
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
i've moved here to that

812
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,520
kind of vector field representation of

813
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
the difference between

814
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,000
value only learning and

815
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,799
performance here's our robot who's only

816
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,600
interested

817
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
in kind of taking the ruler putting it

818
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
on the hill and then going in the

819
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,679
direction of the ruler going uphill

820
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
that's the sort of scalar approach to

821
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,279
pursuing peaks

822
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,559
in contrast we have that

823
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,399
peak climbing or hill climbing element

824
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,880
in active inference as that irrotational

825
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,720
or longitudinal current

826
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
but we also get this solenoidal element

827
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
so i'm wondering

828
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,159
talking to people about performance for

829
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,960
example

830
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
or training in some way how would it be

831
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,720
different

832
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,919
to promote this sort of value and

833
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,279
equivalent

834
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,039
flow model rather than a

835
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,240
comparative reward driven model like

836
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,240
if a learner is constantly assessing

837
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,000
whether it's a multiple choice test or

838
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,159
whether it's baseball pitching or

839
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,279
something like that

840
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,080
if a learner is always assessing the

841
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,519
value of states

842
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
and everything is framed as value

843
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,279
maximization and you're going to want to

844
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,399
be doing

845
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,880
accurate states you want you know the

846
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,159
pitch you want to be getting your

847
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,760
pitches more accurate because more

848
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
accurate is more rewarding

849
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
i'm just wondering how it changes

850
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,760
training or the experience of practice

851
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,799
to know that there's times when one is

852
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,159
pursuing value or that

853
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,919
in the long range pursuit of value can

854
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,279
be achieved through

855
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,559
this rotational or exploratory element

856
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
blue and then anyone else

857
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,840
so just talking about pitching

858
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,360
specifically like yeah

859
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
you can you know hit the bullseye right

860
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,399
if you're

861
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,240
gonna pitch you know pitch a ball you

862
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,519
can hit the bullseye you can hit the

863
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
target get it right over home plate

864
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,080
but like you never explore like what

865
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,880
about like

866
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,120
spinning the ball what effect will like

867
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,799
different spins that you put on the ball

868
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,679
have

869
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,440
on you know the way that the batter hits

870
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,919
it so like the accuracy versus like

871
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
the finesse of it and i think about that

872
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
in terms of dance also like if you're

873
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,240
not

874
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,039
if you don't explore like you know what

875
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,640
it feels like like if you're only trying

876
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,399
to accurately make a movement

877
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
you're never exploring like the finesse

878
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,720
element of it so there's no like

879
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,360
room for perfection or like ultimate

880
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,840
mastery i think

881
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,360
and where does skill become mastery

882
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
it's sort of like at least in chess it's

883
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
the the masters who

884
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
appear to challenge some of the basic

885
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
rules like they don't castle early

886
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
because there's some deeper plan or a

887
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,120
jazz musician

888
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,519
who moves beyond the framework of

889
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,159
regular

890
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,519
timing to introduce some other element

891
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,880
so that play element becomes especially

892
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,519
important

893
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
it's almost like if you never learn how

894
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,799
to do it

895
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,279
correctly or normatively you can't throw

896
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,720
the baseball so you got to get it over

897
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,600
the plate

898
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,559
but then the mastery level after

899
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,600
performance has been

900
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,960
demonstrated in a sense involves

901
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
inventing a new way to pitch like

902
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
there's you know a

903
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,679
fraction of baseball pitchers who throw

904
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,919
sidearm or throw knuckleball

905
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,360
all these different sort of

906
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,039
unconventional approaches

907
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
that aren't the value function that they

908
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,480
learned initially

909
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,559
or maybe it was their biomechanics and

910
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,080
that was the value function that worked

911
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,559
for them

912
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,480
and some other value function just

913
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
wouldn't have worked with their

914
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
body and brain steven and then anyone

915
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
else

916
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,279
yeah thinking from the perspective of

917
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,200
coaching because um

918
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
so my supervisor works a lot with

919
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,880
systemic coaching and performance

920
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
coaching

921
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,440
is this this becomes a more unifying

922
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,000
approach

923
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
it might be for specific things

924
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,279
optimal control theory is quite useful

925
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,399
for just

926
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,880
unpacking something but if you want to

927
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
look at performance coaching

928
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,000
more broadly or developmental coaching

929
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,559
more broadly and how they relate this

930
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,919
could be useful and i'm just thinking

931
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,320
about

932
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,080
christian ericsson the you know the

933
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
soccer player i know if you heard he

934
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,799
collapsed during

935
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,159
the euros and uh his heart stopped and

936
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,640
all the team were around him trying to

937
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
and then they had to play the game

938
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,159
in about an hour's time now

939
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,199
their ability to perform

940
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,560
um was going to be very hard it's not a

941
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,079
performance coaching

942
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,440
question at that point there's these

943
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
other dynamics going on

944
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,960
and i think that this this ability for

945
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,560
active inference to

946
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,800
at least unify how regimes can change

947
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
and how it could be the environment

948
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,359
the system the the emotions all these

949
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
things are quite um

950
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
quite useful

951
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,960
thanks dean yeah

952
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
yeah i appreciate what you're saying

953
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
there steve and i i am

954
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,639
aside from the from the step-by-step

955
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,760
part that i think the caudate nucleus

956
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
tends to to perform when we're when

957
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
we're trying to

958
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,520
climb that little mountain there

959
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,839
robotically

960
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,520
it's another factor i think that's kind

961
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
of interesting and that's um

962
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
if it's embodied and it's skilled

963
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,440
there's probably

964
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,320
three kinds of math at play there's

965
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,599
materialization the how

966
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
sort of the engineering of it there's

967
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
the what's in what's out

968
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
what's supliferous and what what needs

969
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
to be

970
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,079
an element within the performance and

971
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
then i think what this paper does

972
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,440
in the interactions piece pieces it

973
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,640
brings the the probably

974
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,760
into the conversation

975
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,599
and i think you need all three kinds of

976
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
calculations in order to be able to get

977
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,119
a real grip on

978
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,200
on what's going on maybe not an optimal

979
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,320
grip at least

980
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
a fuzzy grip on what to do next i think

981
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,480
if you

982
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,200
only have two of those elements you've

983
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,640
got the perfect conditions for an

984
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,320
instrumentalist approach when you add

985
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,079
the probably

986
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,280
whether it's erickson um

987
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
what did he text or email all of his his

988
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
teammates and said

989
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,119
go finish the game we gotta we gotta

990
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,079
finish this game

991
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,839
and i think steven's right you can you

992
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,839
can give an instruction to your

993
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,800
teammates

994
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,880
and say i'm fine but you just had a

995
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
cardiac arrest

996
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
and we probably aren't going to be able

997
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
to wipe that from our memory

998
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,359
in that moment and so it's a little bit

999
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,920
more complicated when we add probably

1000
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
but i think we need probably in order

1001
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,960
for it to be interactionist

1002
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,480
so that team like in the middle of the

1003
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,040
game

1004
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,079
the personnel of the team changed

1005
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,200
in the individual story of motor control

1006
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
it's like but that's not between you

1007
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,680
and the soccer ball so why should it

1008
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,359
change performance but when we

1009
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,280
have the deep generative model of the

1010
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,359
individual that includes affect that's

1011
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,640
one way to get to

1012
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
the loss of a teammate influencing

1013
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
performance and the second way would be

1014
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
to actually

1015
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,359
genuinely allow teams to be skillful

1016
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,560
performers

1017
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
in the sense that there's a distributed

1018
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,680
cognitive process

1019
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,359
on the team just like there is in the

1020
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,040
body and so

1021
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,760
they actually changed and whoever steps

1022
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,400
into

1023
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,800
that person's position on the field

1024
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
they're gonna have a different approach

1025
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,640
so it'd be like switching out you know

1026
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
one arm for another arm

1027
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,880
or one forager nest mate for another

1028
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,760
nest estimate

1029
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,119
it's going to change the emergent

1030
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,599
properties of the group in a way that's

1031
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,160
an explanation at the group level rather

1032
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,720
than

1033
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
requiring to come back to just the

1034
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
optimal motor control

1035
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
value driven instruction guided of a

1036
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,240
body

1037
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,479
blue

1038
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
yeah just the probably is like what

1039
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
gives active inference its power

1040
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,119
right like probably if i don't eat

1041
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,880
breakfast i'm going to collapse in the

1042
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
middle of a of a field you know or

1043
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
playing a a game or whatever um so so

1044
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
when you have that

1045
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
that probably it it allows you to guide

1046
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,079
all of your

1047
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,240
actions toward a given intention i think

1048
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,599
thanks blue steven yeah and i also think

1049
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,560
when probably

1050
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,640
because probably often it's still in

1051
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,680
that venue

1052
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,920
my world you know probably i will get

1053
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,119
this game or that game

1054
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,680
when the word uncertainty is put in

1055
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
uncertainty is a much scarier word than

1056
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,000
probability right because it's like

1057
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
it has that risk component um so it's

1058
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,640
really interesting that you say

1059
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,079
that that that um we tend to say

1060
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,800
probably everything will be okay but

1061
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,720
active influence is like

1062
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
you don't know it's all it's all unknown

1063
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,359
to some extent here's

1064
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,240
here's another nice piece from the paper

1065
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,560
that

1066
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
i think can continue this discussion

1067
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
about probability and

1068
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
maybe also how active inference reframes

1069
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,680
it so

1070
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,760
the physics of flow embedded in active

1071
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,520
inference now

1072
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
it's an ongoing discussion exactly the

1073
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,599
formalisms that get us to

1074
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,280
a physics of information flow on sense

1075
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,400
cognition and action so other

1076
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,960
live streams other days other years but

1077
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
let's just roll with this

1078
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,359
physics of flow it's accounting for

1079
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,680
sensory motor behavior to show that

1080
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
motion in a biologically realistic state

1081
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
space irreducibly includes two

1082
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,920
orthogonal kinds of motion

1083
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
the irrotational and the solenoidal

1084
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
component so that's what we're looking

1085
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,079
at here

1086
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,599
just this is a paragraph that's

1087
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,520
representing this piece

1088
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,240
instead of just value only we have value

1089
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,040
and flow

1090
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,960
and again this is key to reiterate

1091
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
because it's something that isn't

1092
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,359
included

1093
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,359
in reward scalar representations

1094
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,520
so the former that the first one the

1095
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,640
curl free

1096
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
is what allows the flow to climb a

1097
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
gradient towards more valuable

1098
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,280
or probable states now that's one of the

1099
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,359
head scratchers in active inference

1100
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,960
that preferred states are likely states

1101
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,040
under an optimistic deep generative

1102
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,079
model

1103
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,119
and that is the alignment

1104
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
that allows us to reduce uncertainty

1105
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,640
and by way of reducing uncertainty

1106
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
achieve

1107
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,280
our target outcomes and so when we align

1108
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
the deep generative model in an

1109
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,400
optimistic way

1110
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,560
such that we believe that likely states

1111
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
are preferred ones

1112
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,920
that it's likely that tomorrow i'll have

1113
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
a regular body temperature

1114
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,359
it's likely that tomorrow i'll be in

1115
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,680
this preferred body position

1116
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,520
then we actually get to pursue

1117
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,200
value as a consequence of reducing

1118
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
uncertainty

1119
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
there's more to say on this but dean go

1120
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
for it and then stephen

1121
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,440
yeah and i think daniel that what that

1122
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,079
points out is that there's a dependency

1123
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
for people who who who want to introduce

1124
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
statistical

1125
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,920
propositions to what's the underlying

1126
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,560
situation that we're observing

1127
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,119
um there's a dependency on the

1128
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,760
derivative math and the accounting math

1129
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,160
you you can't you can't figure out what

1130
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,680
probably is

1131
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
without figuring out how and what and

1132
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,359
having a

1133
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,880
having a a sense of

1134
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,599
confidence around what how and what are

1135
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,960
so i don't think it's

1136
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,440
it isn't just the introduction of active

1137
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,240
inference

1138
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,839
active inference is also wholly

1139
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,240
dependent on a strong

1140
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,119
foundation in terms of really being able

1141
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,200
to get

1142
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,440
from priors through that hidden state

1143
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,839
and how do we do that we have to have

1144
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:32,880
derivatives

1145
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,760
and we have to have accounts so i think

1146
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,560
um

1147
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
there's a real codependency back to the

1148
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,760
between comment

1149
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,960
that steven brought up

1150
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,720
cool thanks steven

1151
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,240
yeah that that that idea of um

1152
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,000
things going through cycles i think that

1153
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
i'm not going to go into ergodicity

1154
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,400
again but you know it often comes up is

1155
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,119
that's from what i'm understanding is is

1156
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,839
pretty much

1157
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,079
not present in optimal motor control

1158
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,359
theory because it's

1159
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,480
it's about you go there and then now you

1160
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,680
have a vector

1161
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,240
and that vector is a thing and that

1162
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,079
thing gets optimized but

1163
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,680
you never have that thing i think like

1164
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
dean was saying there's that kind of

1165
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,880
in-between and

1166
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,440
you're kind of holding that in between

1167
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,160
but but

1168
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
that only makes sense if you keep

1169
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
revisiting the in between

1170
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,319
like if the you need to have ergodicity

1171
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,200
of whatever

1172
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,040
i mean that's an open question again for

1173
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,400
another day but

1174
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,319
the there's some way that you're

1175
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,240
revisiting this understanding because

1176
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,160
otherwise you've got no way to make

1177
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,599
um any sort of information gain

1178
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,520
or information extraction unless you

1179
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,599
have a revisiting

1180
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,760
to compare interesting

1181
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,680
um and it's

1182
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,720
one of the key pieces again that

1183
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
we reduce our uncertainty and achieve

1184
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,960
preferred states

1185
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,200
through that process i'm just imagining

1186
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,040
you know something from

1187
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,240
organic chemistry it's like you want to

1188
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,040
study up cram for your final at ochem

1189
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,240
you want to pass

1190
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,079
so are you going to take a reinforcement

1191
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,680
learning perspective or an active

1192
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,800
inference perspective

1193
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,079
well the reinforcement learning

1194
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,839
perspective is like saying you'll get

1195
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,760
the big reward when you pass

1196
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,160
so what's the most rewarding problem

1197
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,520
that we should be solving or what's the

1198
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,760
most rewarding chapter to review

1199
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,000
but you don't know because if you knew

1200
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,599
then you'd pass ochem

1201
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,119
so you're kind of right back at square

1202
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,359
zero with value because

1203
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,480
you framed learning as a value question

1204
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
in contrast the active inference learner

1205
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,680
would be like oh

1206
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,880
sure my preference is to pass how am i

1207
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,200
going to reduce my uncertainty about the

1208
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,240
critical path

1209
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,960
of passing well let's i haven't even

1210
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,560
opened the textbook let's go to the

1211
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,040
first

1212
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
table of contents or something like that

1213
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,440
like reduction of uncertainty

1214
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,319
gives a first step and then it even

1215
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,359
allows for

1216
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,720
okay maybe that wasn't even the right

1217
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
first step or maybe that was a good

1218
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,200
two-step

1219
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,560
path and now i'm ready to go a different

1220
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,119
way but i'm trying to reduce my

1221
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:13,920
uncertainty

1222
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,760
about how to get to what i prefer

1223
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
which is passing rather than i have a

1224
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,079
priori valued

1225
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,040
this future state and now i'm going to

1226
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,440
back

1227
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,680
propagate value at every single step of

1228
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,480
the line

1229
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,920
and then i'm going to stress myself out

1230
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,680
if this specific chapter

1231
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,240
isn't maximally rewarding because

1232
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,599
everything again

1233
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,920
has to get reduced to value in this

1234
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,960
value is everything framework but in the

1235
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,280
uncertainty reduction framework

1236
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,880
we see sort of this mist of uncertainty

1237
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,839
and then regularities and especially

1238
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,960
dependable ones

1239
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,920
emerge out of that and so we're planning

1240
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,599
amidst uncertainty

1241
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
with preferences in mind trying to

1242
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,720
figure out what to do

1243
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,280
that's planning as inference amidst

1244
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,800
uncertainty

1245
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,079
which is just a world apart from

1246
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,880
planning to maximize value through time

1247
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,680
given

1248
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,480
you know what model again of how value

1249
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,440
is assigned

1250
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,240
it's just a recursive question and value

1251
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,839
learning doesn't give us that higher

1252
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,880
level answer

1253
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,800
for how we should actually go about

1254
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
planning to obtain values

1255
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,440
let alone critiquing value as a

1256
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,480
pervasive framework

1257
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,400
stephen well actually that's a very

1258
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,520
interesting

1259
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,920
talk about organic chemistry experiences

1260
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,960
at university

1261
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,599
that i had an absolute nightmare on my

1262
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,440
organic chemistry i

1263
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
might i've given my textbook to someone

1264
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
i've got behind on the organic side

1265
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,240
and um it was this like two inch thick

1266
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,839
textbook on organic chemistry and every

1267
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,760
time you go into it's got so many words

1268
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,520
it's long names and all of this

1269
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,800
and what's going on it's really

1270
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,480
interesting because we had this class

1271
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,200
with the new

1272
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
professor and he got there and he got a

1273
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
few people to go up to the board

1274
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,440
and it became clear that absolutely no

1275
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,280
one knew their organic chemistry

1276
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
and no one had seemed to pick up on this

1277
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
so we were now in the second year no one

1278
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,640
knew

1279
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,839
they were doing i think it was even the

1280
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,680
third year and he said

1281
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,079
and he said he recommended a little thin

1282
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,760
exercise book

1283
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,560
with exercises not on all the different

1284
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,920
chemical reactions and all the

1285
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,119
structures that just

1286
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,520
the key reactions and just to go through

1287
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,359
these exercises in this thin book and

1288
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,000
basically

1289
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
that got me through the exam and got me

1290
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,440
on track

1291
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,160
not and i you know so going for the big

1292
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
book and the

1293
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,000
the memorizing and the optimal control

1294
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,800
it was

1295
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,880
just work out the five types of reaction

1296
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,200
and do the exercises and i think that

1297
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
speaks to what you were talking about

1298
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,560
there you know which ways the electrons

1299
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,200
move

1300
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,560
and and that suddenly really really

1301
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,279
changed everything

1302
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,200
there's also some fun drilling happening

1303
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,839
of course

1304
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,440
all around me welcome back

1305
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,560
dave um so this

1306
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
section right here it's it's a nice

1307
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,839
challenge

1308
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,680
it increases the difficulty of speaking

1309
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,359
but it's fun

1310
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,560
this um is a challenge for other

1311
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,040
frameworks this idea that the two flows

1312
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,240
together

1313
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,680
provide a richer framework for

1314
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,520
expressing skillfulness

1315
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,440
as a process whose characteristic go

1316
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
beyond a simple gradient of value

1317
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,400
accuracy

1318
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,520
so we saw that reward is enough paper

1319
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,599
recently and some participants in our

1320
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,359
lab were kind of curious about writing a

1321
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,160
response

1322
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,319
because that's the whole argument is

1323
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,160
they said hey reward is

1324
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,480
enough the kernel can be reward and

1325
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,359
that's how you get

1326
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,079
all of these intelligent behaviors

1327
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,599
provided that you have these second

1328
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,319
level

1329
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,640
um tweaks on the model or these bolted

1330
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,480
on modules

1331
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,720
and then the contention of the authors

1332
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,760
here

1333
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,319
is that value functions and indeed any

1334
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,040
motor

1335
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,040
scheme based upon functions that return

1336
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,400
scalars

1337
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
are not up to the task of modeling the

1338
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
variety of skillful acts describing

1339
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,520
human behavior

1340
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,000
any kind of behavior just human because

1341
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,119
by construction

1342
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,960
they cannot account for the solenoidal

1343
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,800
aspect of flow

1344
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,520
so that that's pretty interesting that

1345
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,640
when we have to

1346
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,240
bottleneck into a single number

1347
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,359
we lose a lot of the expressivity that

1348
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,720
allows for

1349
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,880
explore and exploit behavior to almost

1350
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,920
coexist

1351
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,160
because we're collapsing onto a number

1352
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,960
line

1353
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,040
so there's extremely limited

1354
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,240
availability for

1355
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,400
you know what do you want for your main

1356
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,319
dish and your side dish and you just say

1357
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,000
seven you can't express two things

1358
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,319
with just one number but if you could

1359
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,400
say you know seven and three

1360
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
you could express something that's more

1361
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,559
in a two-dimensional space

1362
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,240
blue so i think you bring up an

1363
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,319
interesting point about any behavior

1364
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,119
or just human behavior um and i think

1365
00:48:59,119 --> 00:48:59,599
about

1366
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,800
you know there's like dolphins that use

1367
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,000
tools right to crack open like fish and

1368
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,119
or to crack open not the fish but the um

1369
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,400
the sea urchins right so there's

1370
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,480
dolphins that use tools for eating and

1371
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,839
then there's dolphins that don't

1372
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,960
and and so is there and like this is

1373
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,240
like a hereditary like

1374
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,079
it's it's an example of cultural

1375
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,839
evolution in dolphins actually

1376
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
so it's you know it's hereditary but

1377
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,280
only because

1378
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
it's passed on through learning and

1379
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,839
social learning right

1380
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,680
so you know you bring up and and then we

1381
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,280
saw the motor plant right like the

1382
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,079
motorized

1383
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,480
plant like does the plant learn where

1384
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,200
the like

1385
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,760
how like skillful performance i mean

1386
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,720
this is a skill for

1387
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
performance on the part of the plant so

1388
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,720
it's a really interesting question

1389
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,440
whether

1390
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,880
you know i mean we think about active

1391
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,720
inference as applying to all

1392
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,079
non-equilibrium steady state systems but

1393
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,359
does this maybe apply only in the human

1394
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,599
sense of movement movement or what about

1395
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,960
like tribes of

1396
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,119
humans like what about like in a nomadic

1397
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,960
kind of population would this apply

1398
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,599
there also

1399
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,760
cool here's another nice piece in this

1400
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
section that i think will be useful for

1401
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,599
us to learn about

1402
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,640
so technically it's easier to read when

1403
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,720
it's already been written when you're

1404
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,000
getting the drilling

1405
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,559
experience that's when it's the hardest

1406
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,520
to skillfully

1407
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,240
improvise but reading is a little easier

1408
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,359
technically

1409
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,200
active inference extends popular

1410
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,880
predictive coding models used in

1411
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,000
neuroscience

1412
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,720
where perception critical only

1413
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,680
perception

1414
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,839
is cast in terms of prediction error

1415
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,160
minimization so that's the classic round

1416
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,800
ballard

1417
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,240
99 paper that's sort of a mega citation

1418
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,839
and there's a huge amount of

1419
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,559
subsequent work and predictive

1420
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,720
processing or predictive coding

1421
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,839
is just looking at the relationship from

1422
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:54,720
sense

1423
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,440
to updating of a generative model of

1424
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,280
sense so it's a signal processing

1425
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,160
framework

1426
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,839
and this is something i know that dave

1427
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,280
is a big fan of

1428
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,599
both he knows drills and hammers i know

1429
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,960
that dave is a

1430
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,280
fan of talking about the signal

1431
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,000
processing

1432
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,079
and the audio processing routes of

1433
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,680
active inference

1434
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,040
so this is just on the inbound just

1435
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,040
from sensory information to estimates of

1436
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,240
that generative model of that

1437
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,880
generative process of the sensory data

1438
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,040
the active inference framework

1439
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,559
extends this account of predictive

1440
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,160
processing to model

1441
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,559
motor control and explains action

1442
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,680
selection

1443
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,920
by appealing to the minimization of

1444
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,839
divergence between predicted sensory

1445
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:40,400
data

1446
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,760
and actual sensory data so here we have

1447
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,640
the exact

1448
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,200
same divergence minimization it will

1449
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,400
sound better on the live stream

1450
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,440
my jitsi colleagues don't worry um it's

1451
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,160
the same

1452
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,960
divergence that's being minimized which

1453
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,400
is the difference between

1454
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,680
observed and expected sensory data so

1455
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,079
in predictive processing it's about

1456
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,400
sense and perceiving sense and so you

1457
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
want to minimize the divergence between

1458
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,640
what sensory data you expect and what

1459
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,079
you're actually getting

1460
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,599
but active inference adds inference

1461
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,960
uh planning as inference into the loop

1462
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,160
and explains action selection also in

1463
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,880
terms of the exact same divergence goal

1464
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,559
of predictive processing

1465
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,359
which is again to have your observed

1466
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,559
sensory outcomes

1467
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,319
come into line with your expected

1468
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,599
sensory outcomes

1469
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,040
dean yeah i

1470
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,800
i one of the things i used to

1471
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,440
share with people is so today i'm i'm

1472
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,160
wearing my

1473
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,040
uh murder of of crow's t-shirt because i

1474
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,599
used to study a lot of corvette behavior

1475
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,040
and even though i there's

1476
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,599
there's still some question as to what

1477
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,280
sort of

1478
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,400
verbal cues there what instructions

1479
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,319
corvids are able to share because they

1480
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,680
are social animals and they're

1481
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,839
they are problem solvers but you don't

1482
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,640
have one corbin standing

1483
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,119
to the side as another corvette solves a

1484
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,359
problem giving them instructions

1485
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,359
so i think it's kind of interesting when

1486
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,359
we're when we're looking at this

1487
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,000
behavior

1488
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,119
question whether we're the only species

1489
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,200
that are actively inferring

1490
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,319
because i think that there are other

1491
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,240
species out there that you can make a

1492
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,599
case that

1493
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,440
they are doing that probably

1494
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,240
form of questioning and answering as

1495
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,280
well

1496
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,400
um so and and yeah it can be tools

1497
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,960
it can be based on on on social

1498
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,040
constructs

1499
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,800
um it can be based on caching

1500
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,000
so deep memory and again there's a

1501
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,520
dependency i think

1502
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,200
for behavior that uses active inference

1503
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,839
to also

1504
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,440
some grounding in how and what

1505
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,920
so i don't think that active inference

1506
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,280
in and of itself

1507
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,440
will allow us to to

1508
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,160
minimize anything unless we have the

1509
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,200
derivative

1510
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,599
and the accounts so i think it's i think

1511
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,680
it's it's a virtuous triad

1512
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,000
here but i think what this paper is

1513
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
trying to do is get away from the idea

1514
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,720
that

1515
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,800
all problems can be solved with only two

1516
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,839
kinds math

1517
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,359
cool thank you stephen

1518
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,800
yeah further to that point around you

1519
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,240
know

1520
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,359
what humans do or animals do in general

1521
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,079
is

1522
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,799
you could say optimal control approaches

1523
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,280
maybe

1524
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,680
it's only really humans that can apply

1525
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,000
that extra level on top

1526
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,920
as this kind of constraining kind of

1527
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,599
deductive

1528
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,319
idea and every every other organism is

1529
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,520
really

1530
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,680
working with this kind of flow i mean if

1531
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,599
you see a squirrel trying to run up in

1532
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,160
a tree and between trees and chase

1533
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,920
another squirrel around the trees it's

1534
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
quite phenomenal

1535
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,880
just how agile they are and the speed

1536
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,240
they can work at

1537
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,760
and um so there's some sort of skillful

1538
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,760
performance that they've got

1539
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,040
so there's this interesting

1540
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,400
thing whereby you've got this we

1541
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,599
see optimal control as more

1542
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,720
straightforward

1543
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,599
but it basically it's almost really

1544
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,799
optimal control just

1545
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,880
isn't implementable in practical terms

1546
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,280
it's almost it's a it's an what you

1547
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,079
could say it's a

1548
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,359
non-ergodic deductive extra

1549
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,000
that humans bring to the table to

1550
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,440
explain

1551
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,119
the mechanical world that they're

1552
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,480
bringing to bear

1553
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,799
in some way so it's kind of interesting

1554
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,240
it just happens to be that was the first

1555
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,319
explanation we had for this type of

1556
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,240
stuff

1557
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,880
nice so let's think about what active

1558
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,760
inference is

1559
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,839
and then see who might be doing it or

1560
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,280
what might be doing it

1561
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,319
so again the core idea is that rather

1562
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:06,720
than

1563
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,359
selecting commands the organism in

1564
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,599
active inference is inferring what it

1565
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,880
must should be doing under this same

1566
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,760
imperative of predictive coding which is

1567
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,000
to minimize the relationship

1568
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,480
minimize the divergence between observed

1569
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,640
and expected outcomes through time

1570
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,480
crucially this brings perception and

1571
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,040
action together in the same functional

1572
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,240
profile

1573
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,640
we have them on a current sort of

1574
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,599
trading uh

1575
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,079
market almost like we can reduce our

1576
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,119
uncertainty through

1577
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,040
updating our model and we reduce our

1578
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,720
uncertainty through action

1579
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,440
so updating an action or action and

1580
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,240
inference

1581
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,280
are put on common footing and it also

1582
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,920
explains

1583
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,680
some so this is the sort of

1584
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,960
computationalist or

1585
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,079
um algorithmic level is we're making a

1586
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,680
sensory motor model

1587
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,359
that doesn't just have arrows connecting

1588
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,280
pieces ad hoc and say look they're

1589
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,040
connected because i drew a picture

1590
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,200
we're bringing perception and action

1591
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,400
together

1592
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,599
in a common modeling

1593
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,720
framework and also on the neurological

1594
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,480
it explains some of the similarities

1595
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,079
between the functions of sensory and

1596
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,440
motor cortices

1597
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,680
so that speaks to dean's points earlier

1598
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,280
and to a lot of these brain regions that

1599
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,559
might have been discovered

1600
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,720
or initially characterized as having a

1601
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
more cognitive or a more motor role but

1602
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,480
then it's shown that they play

1603
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,799
other roles and so you know cue the

1604
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,799
endless clickbait oh this brain region

1605
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,000
associated with this

1606
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,119
also does that should that be surprising

1607
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,720
should that be salient or

1608
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,599
should we have another view where that

1609
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,520
is to be expected

1610
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,599
now while this move from a problem of

1611
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,559
control

1612
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,359
so optimal motor control that's the

1613
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,400
action side

1614
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,240
and then there's so pure action side

1615
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,839
optimal motor control

1616
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,599
tends to not concern itself too much

1617
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,520
with uncertainty of measurement or deep

1618
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,880
generative models

1619
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,119
and then you have the pure sensory

1620
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,400
processing side that's kind of

1621
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,160
predictive processing

1622
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,839
this move from a problem of control to

1623
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,839
one an inference in terms of active

1624
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,280
inference does not make the problem

1625
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,000
mathematically

1626
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,799
easier in and of itself but it offers a

1627
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,400
different model of skilled action which

1628
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,280
respects the neurophysiological evidence

1629
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,520
so in other words we're taking the sort

1630
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,280
of problem of going from

1631
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,240
sense data to a generative model the

1632
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,000
predictive processing model

1633
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,920
and then the forward model from

1634
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,040
internal states to action selection

1635
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,079
and it's easier to of course

1636
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,559
subset to just one of those directions

1637
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,599
and say that one has a tractable model

1638
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,559
but active inference is combining both

1639
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,680
directions

1640
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,760
or integrating across these two

1641
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,960
different

1642
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,359
ways of like looking at sense in action

1643
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,319
and saying let's have

1644
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,599
one model of sense in action with a

1645
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,960
common

1646
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,040
functional profile as they describe it

1647
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,599
here now

1648
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,440
which systems have it slash do it

1649
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,520
that's the realism question and the

1650
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,440
instrumentalism question is

1651
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,920
which systems can we model as if they're

1652
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,040
doing this

1653
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,960
so i think that the instrumentalism

1654
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,040
question which as always it's about

1655
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,599
us so it's easier to answer is the kinds

1656
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,559
of systems

1657
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,839
that have sensory motor input output

1658
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,119
dynamics so everything from a

1659
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,240
self-driving car to

1660
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,920
different kinds of animals we could

1661
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,280
model as if

1662
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,680
they were getting input generative model

1663
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,839
output so the things that people model

1664
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,599
with ooda

1665
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,680
or the that classical sandwich of

1666
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,880
cognition

1667
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,440
those are the kinds of systems that are

1668
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,240
apt to be modeled with active inference

1669
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,920
the kinds of things that people were

1670
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,160
modeling with optimal control

1671
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,559
going from the model to action and the

1672
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,000
kinds of systems that people

1673
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,559
were modeling with predictive processing

1674
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,359
from

1675
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,400
sensory inputs to generative model

1676
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,240
both of those and ones that especially

1677
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,079
are doing both those are some of the

1678
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:04,799
most

1679
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,599
amenable uh systems for active imprints

1680
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,000
stephen

1681
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,599
you know i was wondering this this idea

1682
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,440
of functional profile

1683
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
is i haven't heard that one before it

1684
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,960
might be another one to think on the

1685
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,839
ontology

1686
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,119
that's been talked about how have you

1687
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,240
seen that being used anywhere else um in

1688
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,520
terms of active inference

1689
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,839
functional profile

1690
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,960
good question it doesn't seem like it's

1691
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,160
used anywhere else

1692
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,920
in this paper and i

1693
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,960
don't off hand recall

1694
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,559
what other papers it might have been

1695
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,160
used in but that's a great point

1696
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,760
something to ask about

1697
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,559
um i think that the notion of just

1698
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,000
function

1699
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,680
is a key one to follow and

1700
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,440
uh what what

1701
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,200
how how do we follow a function yeah go

1702
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,480
ahead stephen

1703
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,319
yeah i suppose because this is talking

1704
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,680
about

1705
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,720
actions skillful performance function

1706
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,000
starts to it's thinking about functional

1707
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
as in how to achieve an

1708
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,240
action of skillful performance so maybe

1709
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,920
that's how it comes in here

1710
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,119
whereas a lot of some of the other

1711
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,520
papers there's no moving parts so to

1712
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,720
speak it's all information based

1713
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,000
in in terms of um but i think it's

1714
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,440
it's interesting in terms of um

1715
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,760
what that does or what it's trying to do

1716
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,280
it's another way of trying to speak to

1717
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,319
something which is a bit bigger you know

1718
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,280
that's one thing i've noticed inference

1719
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,280
normally things are trying to define

1720
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,760
what everything is this one it gives

1721
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,480
these it

1722
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,200
gives these pullbacks they're like okay

1723
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,000
we've got a functional

1724
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,520
profile now that allows us to

1725
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,079
um do xyz but like i say it does provide

1726
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,440
that challenge of

1727
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,760
trying to fit that into these other

1728
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,640
pullbacks

1729
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,559
that we seem to be keep finding

1730
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,839
appearing

1731
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,200
like you know the effective charge

1732
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,640
that came up in one and so yeah i think

1733
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,359
that's a kind of an interesting

1734
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:19,599
question about how that fits in

1735
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,599
with other types of models or

1736
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,440
ways of translating between spaces or

1737
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,160
frameworks

1738
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,880
dean thanks yeah so i wonder

1739
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,079
so let's just take that to its its next

1740
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,200
logical place so

1741
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,920
let's start with a functional profile

1742
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,240
not necessarily work back but

1743
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,160
is there some way for us to be able to

1744
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,359
identify

1745
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,440
what's in that profile that would allow

1746
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,760
for active inference and should we

1747
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,000
is that something that that is that

1748
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,119
dangerous or is that

1749
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,720
legitimate

1750
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,078
nice question

1751
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,480
here's a little bit where they're

1752
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,079
getting at this realism and

1753
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,559
instrumentalism

1754
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,760
discussion so even some of the most

1755
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,520
forthright defenders of the active

1756
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,000
inference

1757
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,960
framework assemble have backed away from

1758
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,880
making such strongly realist claims

1759
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,160
about the causally

1760
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,599
efficacious character of generative

1761
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,839
model so here is where we see

1762
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,200
um hardcore realism so it's nice you

1763
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:31,680
know and

1764
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,359
as we work towards the terms and the

1765
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,520
ontology how can we classify

1766
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,520
different senses or uses of terms

1767
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,079
first in 2013 has advanced the view that

1768
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,839
an agent does not have a model of its

1769
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,319
world it is a model

1770
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,440
now that's an interesting claim

1771
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,480
um but the authors bring this up

1772
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,720
by also qualifying fristen's use of

1773
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,400
model from a different paper

1774
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,240
and saying crucially if we accept the

1775
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,760
generative models of the active

1776
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,400
inference

1777
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,839
frameworks not sure if this

1778
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,440
is the if there's saying you know

1779
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,520
usually it's framework but

1780
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,880
are will there be multiple active

1781
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,799
inference frameworks in line with these

1782
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,799
proposals we must embrace the idea that

1783
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,559
generative models are causal in the

1784
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,480
sense of an agent's inactive attunement

1785
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,000
with the world

1786
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,359
rather than part of the causal

1787
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,440
efficacious machinery used by an agent

1788
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,839
so that's an interesting claim blue

1789
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,119
so i i was thinking about like you know

1790
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,960
that an agent doesn't have a model of

1791
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,039
the world but it is a model and like

1792
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,720
i think about that in terms of people

1793
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,079
that are that get

1794
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,680
have traumatic brain injury and then

1795
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,119
have like

1796
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,359
dramatic amnesia like can't remember how

1797
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,240
to walk or

1798
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,880
talk or eat and have to like relearn all

1799
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,440
of these

1800
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,640
things right so so i think about like if

1801
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,440
we don't

1802
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,920
i mean in that case it seems like the

1803
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,799
model

1804
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,640
like you have a model and then you

1805
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,319
suddenly don't have a model

1806
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,520
but it's like if you are a model

1807
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,240
are you suddenly not a model or is your

1808
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,599
is that like a temporal

1809
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,680
disruption i don't know like so that

1810
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,960
that to me i mean

1811
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,720
and this is an instrumentalist realist

1812
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,240
debate i realize

1813
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,319
but where do you you know if you are a

1814
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,240
model is it like a temporal disruption

1815
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,920
and suddenly you have to start over

1816
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,079
or what does that that look like in in

1817
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,079
those circumstances

1818
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,280
nice question stephen

1819
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,680
yeah i mean in a way i suppose when

1820
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,559
someone has to re-learn

1821
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,880
that the fact that they are at some

1822
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,960
level their body is part of being that

1823
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,839
model that gives them

1824
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,599
access to either some priors

1825
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,160
or that they call it the morphological

1826
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,480
computing capacity the body's capacity

1827
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:46,960
to then

1828
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,119
form those priors because um

1829
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,599
you know if if however certain parts of

1830
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,599
the body are

1831
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,000
like with a stroke that can be kind of

1832
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,520
challenging because that

1833
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,559
maybe the actual way the body moves

1834
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,520
is compromised therefore the ability to

1835
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,119
use it to recreate

1836
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,160
is is diminished i mean the question of

1837
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,880
how much it's diminished then becomes

1838
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,319
i don't know if anyone could quantify

1839
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,119
that but it's interesting

1840
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,880
it's a good point an instrumentalist

1841
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,160
would say well yeah the brain

1842
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,400
isn't you know per se doing active

1843
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,920
inference we're going to model it as

1844
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,319
such

1845
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,079
but then when there is an injury to the

1846
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,079
physical system

1847
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,119
then we say oh we're still just modeling

1848
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:32,240
it with active inference we're just

1849
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,920
changing our active inference model or

1850
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,119
has the actual

1851
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,319
system itself changed so will we just

1852
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,640
always say that even when the system

1853
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,240
changes

1854
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,680
in the physical world we're just going

1855
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,480
to update our

1856
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,240
model and just always stay in the

1857
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,760
instrumentalism land or

1858
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,480
are there times where changes in the

1859
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,520
world

1860
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,760
make the instrumentalism verge into

1861
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,680
realism as if it's actually describing

1862
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,520
something about the world that's going

1863
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,119
to be a very delicate

1864
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,200
walk and they they

1865
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,760
are arguing that again if we think about

1866
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,039
these generative models

1867
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,640
as purely formal and epistemic tools

1868
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,039
so just like a linear regression you

1869
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,640
know you can do a linear regression

1870
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,240
on gdp or on some other feature you can

1871
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,400
do a t-test in a double-blind study it

1872
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,480
doesn't make the people a t-test

1873
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,119
it doesn't make the gdp a linear model

1874
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,039
so it doesn't make something active

1875
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,079
inference

1876
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,319
just to use it in this statistical

1877
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,520
framework

1878
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,119
that's what's meant by the formal and

1879
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,200
epistemic tools

1880
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,359
then this framework is we argue

1881
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,680
compatible with a sensory motor approach

1882
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,200
to understanding skilled action

1883
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,039
it's interesting to me because the

1884
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,200
sensory motor approach to understanding

1885
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,720
skilled action

1886
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,559
itself could have a realist or an interp

1887
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,240
or an instrumentalist approach

1888
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,000
the instrumentalist sensory motor would

1889
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,160
say i'm not even saying this system has

1890
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,119
sense in action

1891
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,880
i'm just saying we could model it as if

1892
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,400
it had sense in action

1893
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,559
whereas the realism of sensory motor

1894
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,000
would say this system

1895
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,839
actually does have sensory and active

1896
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,839
components

1897
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,238
and also this is another important note

1898
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,000
the sensory motor view

1899
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,479
reflects a spectrum of ideas which

1900
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,238
includes simple open loop

1901
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,799
sensory motor correlations closed loop

1902
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,920
systems regularities given a goal and

1903
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,080
optimal sets of regularities according

1904
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,520
to a certain performance

1905
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,319
metrics these can be understood using

1906
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,158
the tools of dynamical models of

1907
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,759
cognition

1908
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,600
capturing the brain body environment

1909
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,439
interactions in terms of dynamical

1910
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,920
systems

1911
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,080
as opposed to assuming the agent is

1912
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,719
involved in symbolic computation

1913
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,880
so it's almost like we see a lot of

1914
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,000
separation of

1915
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,439
uh the isolation of agency or the

1916
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,359
delineation of agents

1917
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,600
with agent in the niche and then the

1918
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
niche itself so we see like agent

1919
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,120
and external internal states and

1920
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,279
external states and now when we think

1921
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,040
about brain and body

1922
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,880
that's one sort of inseparable dyad

1923
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,839
and then it is also inseparable from the

1924
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:16,719
niche

1925
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,158
so how are we going to take all these

1926
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,040
dynamical systems which have different

1927
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,520
physical and causal connections amongst

1928
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,080
them

1929
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,120
brain body and niche and

1930
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,439
work towards a framework that's actually

1931
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,198
going to

1932
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,040
say what we want to say and be useful

1933
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,560
for what we want to do with these kinds

1934
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,279
of models

1935
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,679
like reducing uncertainty about how

1936
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:38,880
organisms will

1937
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,679
act or designing environments that work

1938
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,158
for

1939
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,479
different sorts of agents how are we

1940
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,279
going to do that effectively

1941
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,799
and drawing from what we know about

1942
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,040
dynamical systems more broadly

1943
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,679
rather than bring on assumptions such as

1944
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,199
that the agent is performing

1945
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,760
symbolic computation which comes along

1946
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,360
with the instructionism and the

1947
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,040
representationism and all these other

1948
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,600
pieces

1949
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,159
stephen you know this is a useful

1950
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,960
uh sentence here to show that dynamic

1951
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,760
that's happening between the kind of

1952
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,960
participatory sense making world um

1953
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,239
and the sort of inactivists and

1954
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,440
the inactive inference

1955
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,040
world um because there's there's these

1956
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,880
useful distinctions that have been

1957
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,840
coming up

1958
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,080
in an activism and this participatory

1959
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,000
sense making

1960
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,719
yet they struggle to give the ways to

1961
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:35,760
actually

1962
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,000
calculate how that comes about outside

1963
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,920
of these kind of metrics

1964
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,679
that are looking from the outside of the

1965
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,360
system so

1966
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,400
um this this is kind of

1967
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,800
quite a dance that's going on but it

1968
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,960
seems to be yielding some

1969
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,199
good um progress for active influence

1970
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,239
because

1971
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,120
they're laying some of the ground for

1972
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,040
active inference to then see what could

1973
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,880
be plausibly

1974
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,719
uh modeled so that's quite useful

1975
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,960
yeah another point to that and also what

1976
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,320
you said

1977
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,440
earlier um

1978
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,120
they're suggesting that active inference

1979
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,560
is going to extend

1980
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,280
costly linear accounts of motor control

1981
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,199
which tend to focus on the contingency

1982
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:19,679
between

1983
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,320
new actions and their consequences so

1984
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,120
the loop

1985
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,800
there which is hardly a loop it's

1986
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,040
actually a line goes from

1987
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,239
action selection to a new

1988
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,320
state like i want you know i want to

1989
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,159
grasp the coffee cup

1990
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,120
how am i going to grasp i grasped that

1991
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,760
is

1992
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,800
the domain of many previous models which

1993
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,560
is like from some sort of delta

1994
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,800
that needs to be accomplished to

1995
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,920
achieving

1996
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,679
that action and that's where the model

1997
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,600
ends

1998
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,520
active inference in fact proposes a

1999
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,800
complementary view

2000
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,719
where predictions of expected

2001
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,640
proprioceptive states

2002
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,560
are not just seen as passive reactions

2003
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,000
to new motor signals

2004
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,800
like in the coffee cup grab example but

2005
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,120
as

2006
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,920
also triggering adjustable dynamic

2007
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,239
reflex arcs to generate new actions

2008
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,600
so here instead of starting from action

2009
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,760
to a new proprioceptive state like i

2010
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,520
want to be in a different state

2011
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,000
so um i want to select an action okay

2012
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,520
now my elbow is in the correct

2013
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
predicted proprioceptive state so we're

2014
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,800
good to go

2015
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,640
here we're starting with the updating

2016
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,440
of our proprioceptive state moving to

2017
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,520
action selection

2018
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,400
inferring our state so action and

2019
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,600
inference

2020
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,840
like the two-stroke engine are now

2021
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,280
working together

2022
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,360
in a way where we can pull out a little

2023
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,040
local stretch

2024
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,080
that has the same functional features

2025
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,360
as this linear causative model above

2026
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,080
because there's going to be some stretch

2027
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,520
where

2028
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,440
that action was performed and where the

2029
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,280
functional characteristics were carried

2030
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,080
out

2031
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,000
but we're embedding that in a

2032
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
deep temporal model and the temporal

2033
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,679
depth of this model confers a more

2034
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,000
active anticipatory role to

2035
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,760
proprioception

2036
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,800
now seen in a causally circular model in

2037
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,400
line with the inactive and embodied

2038
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,520
approach

2039
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,000
so that's that sort of rummaging around

2040
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,199
that gives

2041
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,320
an anticipatory and active role for

2042
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,760
proprioception

2043
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,159
not just a state estimate role for

2044
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,199
proprioception

2045
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,880
so that it can get relayed to the

2046
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,600
central headquarters

2047
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,000
and sent back as an instruction it's not

2048
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,640
like a central intelligence model

2049
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,679
of action selection it's like an

2050
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,120
anticipatory

2051
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,800
deep temporal model that allows sense

2052
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,880
to be doing something slightly different

2053
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,280
stephen

2054
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,920
um just a question when it says and so

2055
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,080
it says new action so new action in

2056
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,520
active influence is

2057
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,719
the new well guess

2058
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,239
i suppose of what the action state is

2059
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,400
and and then the new proprioceptive

2060
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,520
state

2061
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,719
this is interesting thing with

2062
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,560
proprioception

2063
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,080
is is that almost a guess as well

2064
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,440
like based on a mix of um

2065
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,960
sort of intraceptive data

2066
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,400
and other data

2067
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,320
or data but other ways so is it like a

2068
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,000
different types of guessing

2069
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,120
or is one of them action ones

2070
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,000
still being seen as perception in that

2071
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,320
loop

2072
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,960
good question i'm sure there's a lot of

2073
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,080
ways to go about it

2074
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,600
but one thought is even perception

2075
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,320
is inference that's predictive coding so

2076
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,800
our

2077
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,400
visual perception is clearly a generated

2078
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,800
inference there's no blind spot there's

2079
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
resolution and color in the periphery

2080
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,400
where we know the anatomy of the eye

2081
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,239
doesn't directly support that

2082
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,480
and so on there's smoothness even though

2083
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,960
our eyes are constantly secating

2084
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,000
so whether it's a proprioceptor

2085
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,880
or whether it's visual input that is

2086
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,440
also

2087
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,640
inferred as part of the deep generative

2088
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,760
model

2089
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,040
and so when there is ambiguous visual

2090
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,760
input

2091
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,080
or ambiguous proprioceptive input for

2092
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,280
example

2093
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,159
that inactive inference is an

2094
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,880
opportunity for uncertainty reduction

2095
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,679
rather than getting out over our skis

2096
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,840
within saying whether that's a valuable

2097
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,719
or

2098
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,000
a less valuable state we actually

2099
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,880
don't need to judge the value in a

2100
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,480
scalar framework

2101
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,840
of ambiguous versus unambiguous states

2102
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,560
because we can just pursue uncertainty

2103
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,600
reduction

2104
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,440
and then also cast planning as inference

2105
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,560
and perception as inference does that

2106
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,400
make sense stephen and then blue yeah

2107
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,080
that's that's really useful and

2108
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,600
i think it's like what you're saying

2109
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,199
there that also brings in the

2110
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,159
the idea of temple scale so there's with

2111
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,440
vision and with this

2112
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,440
there's what's going on below

2113
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,960
at greater speeds and flux than we can

2114
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,040
know like the circades and the way those

2115
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,440
circades then get put together to be

2116
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,800
this kind of joined up smooth perception

2117
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,000
of vision and

2118
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,920
this this is this new action new

2119
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,840
proprioceptive states that's almost kind

2120
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,320
of

2121
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,600
at the speed of everyday awareness

2122
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,920
you know and once things become longer

2123
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,520
and happen over the period of like

2124
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,520
10 minutes intervals you can no longer

2125
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,159
track that in your working memory or

2126
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,920
your working phenomenological

2127
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,960
consciousness

2128
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,520
so this is kind of like the goldilocks

2129
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,159
zone in a way where we're able to

2130
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,840
when it's talking about new action new

2131
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,640
proprioceptive states it's kind of

2132
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,760
sitting at a kind of um an

2133
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,800
averaged out perceptual

2134
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,360
awareness in a way that we can engage

2135
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,719
interesting point blue

2136
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,560
yeah daniel you already like kind of

2137
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,000
said what i was going to say right after

2138
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,800
stephen but

2139
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,360
um proprio reception really is is the

2140
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,320
expectation

2141
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,040
like where do i expect my body to be

2142
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:21,679
where

2143
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,159
like instead of asking like where is my

2144
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,920
leg it's like where

2145
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,600
is my leg supposed to be or where do i

2146
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,600
think my leg actually is

2147
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,360
and you're not always right right like

2148
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,719
in the phantom limb

2149
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,760
um case and even like you know if you're

2150
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,280
stuck with a pin

2151
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,560
right like so and this is not

2152
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,320
proprioception this is just

2153
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,239
generally like where your nerves are so

2154
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,840
some in some places they're very close

2155
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,560
together

2156
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,960
and you can infer with great accuracy

2157
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,040
where exactly the pin was poked into you

2158
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,880
but in some other places in your body

2159
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,640
the nerves are more

2160
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,040
far apart and so you can't tell even if

2161
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,280
the nerve even if two pins you put a pin

2162
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:57,679
here

2163
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,760
you poke a pin here you touch the same

2164
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,960
place it's like the pin

2165
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,120
is here but you're not always right so

2166
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,000
so there's there's

2167
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,800
this inference that that happens um in

2168
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,760
proprioception

2169
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,800
as well nice it's like there's

2170
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,239
um one mode where you have a very

2171
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,719
high confidence prior of where your arm

2172
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,320
is located you know it's right by my

2173
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,199
side

2174
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,920
let's just say and when there's a high

2175
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,440
confidence prior

2176
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,080
data that don't support that prior are

2177
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,520
only going to move it

2178
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,679
slightly if someone's very convinced

2179
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,840
that something is the case

2180
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,600
and they say it's 100 the case that this

2181
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,960
is this way well then

2182
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,800
you know there's no point in providing

2183
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,040
alternative evidence because

2184
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,400
they're going to see it in terms of

2185
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,719
their prior so in that case of the

2186
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,920
phantom limb

2187
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,640
it's like there's a high precision prior

2188
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,800
that the limb is in a certain location

2189
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,360
in fact it's such a strong prior that

2190
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,800
sensory data

2191
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,719
like proprioceptive data that your arm

2192
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,560
is in a different place or visual data

2193
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,199
that

2194
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,040
for example somebody no longer has that

2195
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,480
limb

2196
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,560
still doesn't manage to update the

2197
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,520
experience

2198
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,280
or the generative model of the limb

2199
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,040
being there so that's one case

2200
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,280
that we can frame in an active inference

2201
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,600
way and another case would be like

2202
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,719
where's my leg i have low confidence

2203
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,760
and now instead of framing this just as

2204
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,199
a estimate that there's an uncertainty

2205
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,040
on and then we're going to have to tag a

2206
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,480
value on

2207
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,920
we go from that estimate with

2208
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,159
uncertainty to

2209
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:31,520
planning as inference what motor control

2210
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,760
or what motor behavior is going to

2211
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,080
reduce uncertainty on the leg and

2212
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,840
sometimes that's like looking

2213
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,800
at it other times it but that's a motor

2214
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,320
behavior with the eyes

2215
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,360
other times it might be doing a motion

2216
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,920
that then like kind of uh gives us some

2217
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,480
sensor

2218
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,560
data so it's kind of i don't know like

2219
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,080
checking your phone and seeing like what

2220
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,360
notifications are there when you're

2221
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,400
uncertain

2222
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,080
maybe sometimes like a shake or

2223
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,920
something like that it's like just

2224
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,719
reactivating a bunch of sensors just to

2225
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:01,679
pass

2226
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,600
say oh yep we're here just checking in

2227
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,360
reducing your uncertainty

2228
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,920
and so the state estimate even when

2229
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,080
there is uncertainty about it

2230
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,199
we can reduce that uncertainty through

2231
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,880
action selection

2232
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,040
rather than just being trapped in a

2233
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
framework of like

2234
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,000
okay i'm not sure where it is and now

2235
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
i'm not sure whether that's rewarding or

2236
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,560
not

2237
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,239
and now i'm not sure which path to take

2238
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,040
that's going to be most rewarding

2239
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,480
we don't go down the reward rabbit hole

2240
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,719
because there's a deep generative model

2241
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,679
and

2242
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:37,040
for evolved slash created or whatever

2243
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,320
organisms those priors are

2244
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,600
fit so it's not just like we're dealing

2245
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,120
with the space of all possible

2246
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,360
generative models these have been

2247
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,560
evolutionarily

2248
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,600
selected to be functional

2249
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,600
in our physical constraints but

2250
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,880
underwater or

2251
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,560
in a different gravity space it'd

2252
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,120
be a different set of priors that would

2253
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,800
need to be

2254
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,400
uh learned or utilized

2255
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,280
in our last piece here what what do you

2256
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,600
think were some of the big

2257
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,199
pieces that we leave this 23 strange

2258
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,000
attractor

2259
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,280
with as we move forward like what kinds

2260
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,199
of

2261
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,840
distinctions or insights here do we want

2262
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,120
to see how they apply in different

2263
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,840
settings

2264
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,280
dean and then anyone else

2265
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,320
okay so this is gonna be a strange twist

2266
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,120
but that's

2267
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,080
that's okay so i came away from the

2268
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,040
paper

2269
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,600
and i thought about some of the things

2270
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,960
that

2271
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,360
casper did bring up casper hess did

2272
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,960
bring up in terms of

2273
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,560
so so what happens when

2274
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,480
when we talk to instructionalists like

2275
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,000
instructors are all around us there's

2276
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,880
people that spend

2277
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,560
a great deal of their life preparing to

2278
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,239
become an instructor

2279
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,360
and we come along and say um yeah that's

2280
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:03,920
great

2281
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,960
we know what you do um but we're gonna

2282
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,560
kind of

2283
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,400
i don't know maybe bring you down a peg

2284
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,679
because we're going to introduce this

2285
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:12,080
other

2286
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,639
stuff that you weren't asked to sort of

2287
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,159
train yourself up on

2288
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:19,199
and i'm not sure if that's a threat or

2289
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,400
not

2290
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,000
i guess it depends on the personality

2291
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,159
who the idea is introduced to but

2292
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,519
i'll bring i'll bring up

2293
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,400
if you know the movies independence day

2294
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,760
and thelma and louise

2295
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,560
um i'm going to bring those into kind of

2296
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,360
into a

2297
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,560
juxtaposition here i think for the

2298
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,520
instrumentalists

2299
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,920
um they don't necessarily see that there

2300
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,040
can be

2301
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,800
for the person who's living out the

2302
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,239
adversarial

2303
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,520
greek myth us against the aliens or

2304
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,679
us against the the people who are

2305
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,679
chasing us down and trying to get our

2306
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,880
our convertible back um there isn't

2307
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,400
there is no set of instructions per se

2308
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,239
that those people want to follow they're

2309
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,320
living the interactionist

2310
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,560
state and you could start out with kick

2311
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,880
the tires and light the fires all uh

2312
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,639
harry connick jr and still end up in a

2313
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,760
rapid deceleration moment a la

2314
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,040
susan sarandon and and gina davis

2315
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,199
and i think for people who are going to

2316
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,880
look at this problem

2317
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,719
in terms of how do we introduce

2318
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,159
interactionism

2319
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,360
in a way that doesn't threaten

2320
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,759
the top-downedness of how most

2321
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,480
most situations where we want people to

2322
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,120
be able to take up this

2323
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,760
embodied skill skillful performance

2324
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,040
without

2325
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,280
putting them in a in a situation where

2326
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,520
they

2327
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,560
behave like aliens or behave like police

2328
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,440
chasing somebody down with a helicopter

2329
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,360
we're gonna have to sort of

2330
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,199
i don't know i don't know if it's a slow

2331
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,480
rolling i'm not sure exactly what it is

2332
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,400
but those people who are now currently

2333
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,760
instructors and instructionalists by

2334
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,480
by profession we're going to have to

2335
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,199
give them

2336
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,080
something so that they don't cling

2337
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,760
desperately to

2338
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,040
a model that i think the authors of this

2339
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,080
paper

2340
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,960
demonstrated requires a rethink i don't

2341
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,040
think we throw out instructionalism

2342
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,000
but i absolutely do think that it's it's

2343
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,159
place on the top of the mountain

2344
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,239
and now all these little robots climbing

2345
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,520
up it

2346
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,040
that that has to be reviewed and

2347
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,040
revisited and so

2348
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,760
i mean as a go forward i don't know how

2349
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,280
we put people

2350
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,560
in a place where they're comfortable

2351
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,280
with that kind of

2352
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,960
i don't want to say it's disruptive but

2353
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,320
i think it is

2354
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,920
but i think we have to be able to come

2355
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,239
at this in a way that doesn't make

2356
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,840
them sort of circle the wagon

2357
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,560
solenoidally and

2358
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,760
try to protect something that obviously

2359
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,080
is

2360
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,639
is up for a bit of evolution before a

2361
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,120
revolution

2362
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:11,360
nice points there stephen

2363
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,000
yeah i like that idea yeah this

2364
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,639
challenge of

2365
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,159
having this mountain that we've kind of

2366
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,440
ascended

2367
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,679
and placed these optimal control

2368
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,040
theories on

2369
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,840
and maybe it's it's more like there's a

2370
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,360
mountain

2371
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,760
of active inference and there's a

2372
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,600
there's a little rock

2373
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,679
a rock structure on the top which is

2374
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,760
optical control theory which

2375
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,639
we're able to sort of utilize on top of

2376
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,880
that you know but it's uh

2377
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,719
it's it's a lot more rickety and it's

2378
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,960
not the

2379
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,280
the main game in town you know the main

2380
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,120
game is our intuition

2381
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,239
our dynamical um

2382
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,719
balancing of all these different free

2383
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:55,600
energy

2384
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,040
parameters um but we do and particularly

2385
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,280
humans have this ability

2386
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,880
to impose this extra

2387
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,960
um shack of tools on the top

2388
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,600
that we now think is the main game in

2389
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,520
town

2390
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,960
nice so to stevens then to dean's point

2391
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,560
so as to which one's the uh

2392
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,320
mountain which one's the mole hill which

2393
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,600
one's the ant hill

2394
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,800
here fristen says optimal control can be

2395
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,440
cast as

2396
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,480
active inference with three

2397
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,440
simplifications so as we

2398
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,920
increasingly clarify our understanding

2399
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,520
of these different models

2400
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,239
will be able to see which models are

2401
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,280
nested within

2402
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,320
one another or are alternate framings of

2403
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,360
one another

2404
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,960
or are you know more overlapping than

2405
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,239
different or what are those key

2406
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,239
distinctions or what are the variables

2407
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,000
where you can expand it to three and all

2408
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,520
of a sudden you've gone from model a to

2409
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,159
b

2410
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,520
so remains to be seen and

2411
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,440
by uh him saying that optimal control

2412
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,239
is a thrice simplified active inference

2413
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,960
along these three specific domains

2414
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,159
it does suggest that the bigger picture

2415
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,239
might be active inference and then you

2416
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,239
get special case

2417
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,000
optimal motor control with a value

2418
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,480
function as a

2419
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,040
derivative model within an active

2420
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,159
inference

2421
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,320
universe even if these other models were

2422
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,840
developed first that's often

2423
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,159
the case that a certain model is

2424
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,360
introduced and then it's

2425
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,760
later generalized in several ways so

2426
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,840
that in the future it's actually seen as

2427
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,520
a special case model

2428
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,679
even though it's actually at one point

2429
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,880
it was the only game

2430
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,360
in town certainly for a lot of biology

2431
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,719
models that's the case

2432
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,960
and then dean i really like this idea of

2433
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,520
like there's a job title called an

2434
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,480
instructor

2435
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,960
and if somebody says i'm an instructor

2436
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,600
in

2437
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,120
you know organic chemistry or in tango

2438
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,040
baseball people know what you're talking

2439
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,080
about so how could interactionism

2440
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,360
be so broadly

2441
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,560
participated in that people say yeah i'm

2442
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,520
an interactor

2443
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,360
i'm a baseball interactor or i'm an

2444
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,679
ochem interactor

2445
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,280
maybe the job would be called that or

2446
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,679
not so how do we

2447
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,920
like you were saying not kind of

2448
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,800
threaten

2449
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,400
or um disrupt their modes but

2450
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,159
give a yes and for what they're working

2451
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,400
on and

2452
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,239
maybe part of it is that the interactor

2453
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,080
it's like we're framing their

2454
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,000
interactions with their

2455
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,040
student let's just say as a cultural

2456
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,080
scaffolding

2457
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,920
of an interaction that doesn't make it a

2458
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,239
symmetric interaction

2459
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,920
it's a culturally scaffolded moment

2460
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,280
of bayesian model updating and so it's

2461
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,000
like

2462
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,159
yes you do give instructions that's the

2463
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,760
verbal term for what you say when you

2464
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,560
say pull

2465
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,760
or breathe or okay slow down you can

2466
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,440
still give instructions we're not

2467
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,040
saying that that is not part of your

2468
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,199
toolkit but let's

2469
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,880
more broadly look at your interactions

2470
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,159
with this dynamical system

2471
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:14,800
as doing what you want to do

2472
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,960
and maybe it'd be enough just to push

2473
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,000
them to that

2474
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,639
edge of the hill and just say

2475
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,480
interactions are a broader

2476
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,719
way than instructions would you want to

2477
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,800
reduce everything you do to just

2478
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,239
barking instructions or sometimes you

2479
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,280
lead by example other times you

2480
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,000
show wordlessly you don't need to frame

2481
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,560
your

2482
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,520
interactions as instructions recognize

2483
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,239
that you're

2484
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:44,400
just dynamically interacting systems and

2485
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,280
this a lot of people are working on a

2486
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,639
framework that suggests

2487
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,480
that this is a broader way of thinking

2488
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,400
about training and

2489
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,480
might be able to help you on one hand

2490
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,480
with the high performance elements

2491
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,800
and on the other hand with accessibility

2492
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,159
and in making your work more

2493
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,440
communicable

2494
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,120
not sure about that of course but just

2495
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,800
one way to go steven

2496
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,920
yeah with the idea of roles and how

2497
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,360
people uh

2498
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,560
look at performance in roles this really

2499
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,400
comes back to coaching again i mentioned

2500
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,440
that earlier is

2501
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,920
you know we've coaching came out of the

2502
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,440
need to supervise

2503
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,880
therapists and how they could be

2504
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,040
guided in their path as they were

2505
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,800
supposedly helping the people that were

2506
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,239
needy

2507
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,520
they needed guidance and that same idea

2508
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,080
now of

2509
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,199
coaching rather than teaching

2510
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:40,239
or instructing and

2511
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:43,520
um while they have their role as giving

2512
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,600
the formal documents that you might need

2513
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,159
and

2514
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,239
providing the bigger narrative and

2515
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,239
giving certain tools

2516
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,360
you know you you within that you there's

2517
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,400
this idea of

2518
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,679
okay what types of developmental or

2519
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,400
performance

2520
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,199
interactions can be nurtured and

2521
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,560
cultivated

2522
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,000
and i think this actually really can tie

2523
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,560
into the kind of pragmatist

2524
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,719
social constructivist approaches that

2525
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,320
coaching's trying to work with

2526
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:18,800
as in but it gives it a bit more um

2527
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
does actually give it a bit more meat

2528
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,639
without becoming too complex which i

2529
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:23,040
think

2530
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,159
previously a lot of the active

2531
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,080
influences may be a bit too abstract

2532
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,679
but this is starting to show a bridge

2533
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,080
there of why coaching

2534
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,880
at different levels can and positive

2535
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,960
psychology more broadly

2536
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,760
can have a role

2537
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,880
okay great thank you stephen dean yeah

2538
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,040
stephen i appreciate exactly what you're

2539
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,199
saying i

2540
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,040
i think to get to a place where

2541
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,280
interactionism

2542
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,639
is no longer threatening

2543
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,239
people have to want or appreciate that

2544
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,080
you can be a subject matter expert and a

2545
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,840
prediction matter expert

2546
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,320
and i'm not sure i think there are maybe

2547
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:06,960
are some

2548
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,159
coaches who are both

2549
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:13,280
and i but i sort of transcended that

2550
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,600
and got into the wayfaring thing because

2551
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,920
wayfaring imposes

2552
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,040
a prediction aspect to this now i can't

2553
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,560
predict for you

2554
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,280
whether that running drum shot that you

2555
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,520
make i can't be in your ear

2556
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,560
i cannot coach you to take that shot in

2557
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,920
that moment with

2558
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,239
that much time left on the clock in fact

2559
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,000
if i do that

2560
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,800
i'm probably adding impediments and i'm

2561
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,360
actually

2562
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,760
being an optimal control list

2563
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,280
micromanaging you

2564
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,000
and you whether you make it or not it's

2565
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,639
not about

2566
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,679
me it's about whether the ball and the

2567
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,199
and the and the basket arrived at some

2568
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,440
sort of outcome that we both want

2569
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,679
i think that i think that that's part of

2570
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:02,960
how we get people to a place where

2571
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,040
their dependency on their subject

2572
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,440
subject matter expertise

2573
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,000
doesn't overwhelm the fact that for

2574
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,760
these performances

2575
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,639
there is a predictive element and so we

2576
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:15,280
have to

2577
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,320
sort of give that equal billing i don't

2578
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,000
think we have to over bill one or the

2579
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,560
other

2580
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,960
it's back to the between and that's a

2581
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,880
prediction matter expert and

2582
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,600
again i don't know if it's a role being

2583
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,400
away

2584
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,960
fairer because you're in the boat with

2585
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,880
that other person right

2586
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,040
it doesn't matter whether you're the one

2587
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,560
saying okay well i'm

2588
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,400
i'm getting a sense of the direction of

2589
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,080
the current right now and the other

2590
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,280
person's

2591
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,199
looking up at the stars you're working

2592
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,719
together

2593
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,560
and so you everybody brings their

2594
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,000
expertise

2595
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,679
and i think that that only

2596
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,960
that only materializes if we can if we

2597
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,880
can include something with the subject

2598
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,480
matter expertise

2599
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,600
culturally yes absolutely there's huge

2600
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,600
cultural piece to it

2601
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,400
but i think i think you can be a coach

2602
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,960
and not necessarily be a wayfarer

2603
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,760
but i think if you're a wayfarer you

2604
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,880
have to bring

2605
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,120
a predictive element into it otherwise

2606
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,840
you're not being a wayfarer

2607
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,800
interesting about having an integrated

2608
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,560
way to talk about

2609
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,000
goal and process

2610
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,920
and interaction with a niche interaction

2611
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,440
with your co

2612
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,719
wayfarers just like your example with a

2613
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:35,280
movie

2614
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,320
you know there's is the map app going to

2615
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,280
tell you which

2616
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,440
directions to take that's kind of on the

2617
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,800
instructionist end

2618
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,520
versus are you on the run so anywhere

2619
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,719
you go

2620
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,960
you're you're just not following

2621
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,280
instructions you're just negotiating

2622
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,600
sequential interactions and reducing

2623
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,040
uncertainty in a way that

2624
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,880
isn't just looking down at the

2625
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,119
application and seeing which way to turn

2626
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:03,520
when nice i'm glad you picked up on the

2627
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,320
uh

2628
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,480
the map going out the back end over the

2629
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,639
trunk of the car

2630
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,920
exactly oh you're reading it oh no

2631
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,960
right um cool well

2632
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,000
steven yes yeah just one question way

2633
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,199
fairer is that like a particular sort of

2634
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,320
approach is like an

2635
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,760
orientation based or well yeah

2636
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,360
yeah you're on your path and how are you

2637
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,280
faring how are you feeling

2638
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,159
okay right it's not just way finding

2639
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,119
it's not just

2640
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:36,400
the discovery piece but it's so how does

2641
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,679
that make you feel being in that

2642
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,119
uncertainty space

2643
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,800
because again if we're going to close

2644
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,440
loop discovery will eventually loop back

2645
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,280
around to recapitulation

2646
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,880
and then all right we're open systems

2647
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,040
that are constantly closing these loops

2648
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,360
so how does that make you feel right

2649
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,639
okay

2650
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:56,159
to connect that also to john boyk

2651
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,800
and second order science as well as a

2652
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,000
bucky fuller in

2653
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,679
trim tab when we're

2654
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,880
the rudder we need to act in an

2655
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,920
anticipatory

2656
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,600
fashion so that's kind of like first

2657
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,119
order cybernetics the

2658
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:14,159
rudder has to turn before you hit the

2659
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:14,960
iceberg

2660
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,639
you know you gotta find a path so

2661
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,000
pathfinding and

2662
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,920
that whole notion of anticipatory

2663
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,199
control

2664
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:24,080
comes to the rudder and the trim tab is

2665
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,639
the little

2666
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:26,719
rudder on the rudder so it's

2667
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:27,679
anticipating

2668
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,960
even the anticipatory nature

2669
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,119
of planning because you have to turn

2670
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:34,080
that trim tab

2671
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,520
even before you turn the rudder and so

2672
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,520
here we have instead of a sort of

2673
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,880
mechanical model

2674
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,920
with recursive levels of rudders we

2675
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,080
actually have hierarchically nested

2676
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,040
priors and so it's a little bit like

2677
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,360
higher and higher level priors

2678
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,239
that in one sense when you look at one

2679
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:55,360
iceberg

2680
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,800
and you try to tell a story by

2681
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,480
backfilling what happens

2682
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,119
they do act in increasingly anticipatory

2683
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:03,920
ways

2684
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,679
but then when it's seen as just part of

2685
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,239
the wayfinding of the ship

2686
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,480
they're all in a cyclic feedback with

2687
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,840
each other and it's not like one is

2688
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,679
really upstream of another

2689
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,360
but there are certainly pieces doing

2690
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,000
different things

2691
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,400
cool stuff

2692
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,000
any um final thoughts or questions i

2693
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:26,960
don't see any other

2694
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,560
questions from the live chat but

2695
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,199
another um interesting and surprising

2696
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:39,520
as usual does anyone have any

2697
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,320
final comments

2698
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,560
well great we'll um look forward to

2699
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,119
some awesome upcoming streams let's just

2700
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,840
look at those really fast

2701
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,280
next week on the 21st

2702
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,000
we're going to have our symposium with

2703
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,360
carl fristen

2704
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,159
so if you've been helping to co-organize

2705
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,840
this event and develop the questions

2706
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,800
with us

2707
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,600
you'll be with us live otherwise we're

2708
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,280
going to be recording this

2709
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,239
not live streaming it and then providing

2710
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,159
the recordings on our youtube

2711
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,719
channel and then for the second two

2712
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:21,679
weeks

2713
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:26,159
of june we're going to be

2714
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,960
doing a more technical or statistical

2715
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,840
paper

2716
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,159
empirical evaluation of active inference

2717
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,320
in multi-armed bandits

2718
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,600
then in early july we're going to have

2719
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,480
a fields and living paper scale free

2720
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,440
biology

2721
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,199
integrating evolutionary and

2722
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,199
developmental thinking

2723
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,440
then uh don't have any papers for the

2724
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,360
end of july or beginning of august but

2725
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,000
we'll

2726
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,960
figure out what we want to do there and

2727
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,480
then we'll be

2728
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,239
turning to some industrial engineering

2729
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,080
and some other areas so

2730
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,440
as always pretty fun journey

2731
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,719
