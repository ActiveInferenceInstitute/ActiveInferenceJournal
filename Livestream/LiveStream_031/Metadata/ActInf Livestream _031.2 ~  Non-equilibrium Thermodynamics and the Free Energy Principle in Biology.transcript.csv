"Speaker 1","00;00;07;19","00;00;37;21","Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Active Inference Lab today. It's October 26th 2021, and we're in active live stream number 31.2. Welcome to the Active Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;38;17","00;01;10;13","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams we're here in our second discussion group discussion for 31 towards the end of October. So also happy Halloween and this is our jumping off point to many ideas. So looking forward to this cool discussion. The goal is going to be to learn and discuss this paper by Patricia Palacios and Mateo Colombo, both of whom are with us today."
"Speaker 1","00;01;10;13","00;01;35;19","So thanks so much to the authors for joining and feel free to address what you can while you're here and then just leave whatever works for you. And in this discussion we can take it many different ways because so many topics came up in the dot zero and dot one, but we have all of the formalisms some big questions, a lot of topics that we raised in the 31.1 video as well."
"Speaker 1","00;01;37;02","00;01;58;07","So we can begin with an introduction and warm up section. We'll have the non authors introduce themselves and then just say Hello. And then we'll pass to the two authors, both of whom are joining for the first time to a stream. So again, thanks for joining and we look forward to the discussion So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California."
"Speaker 1","00;01;58;23","00;02;19;26","And to just add something I'm excited about, Mateo and I were just discussing right before we started some of the sociology meets history and philosophy of science and oh yeah, who could forget about the actual topics themself so there's just some cool intersections that we'll be able to talk about all pass it to Dave."
"Speaker 2","00;02;22;00","00;02;46;11","Hi, I'm retired from Information Technology. I'm in the cool dry mountains of the northern Philippines. And now that I don't have to work for a living, I'm getting really busy on learning cybernetics, which is one of the things I did back in college and having a great time this fired up about having a complexity weekend ramp up starting tomorrow."
"Speaker 2","00;02;47;11","00;02;47;25","So true."
"Speaker 1","00;02;47;28","00;03;09;08","Stephen we can't hear you, Stephen, but you're unmuted, so maybe your audio selection is odd, but let's welcome Stephen back. So figure it out and let's go to Patricia first. Welcome and happy to hear your introduction."
"Speaker 3","00;03;10;24","00;03;42;01","Hello. Well, thank you for the discussion about the interest in discussing our paper. So I'm an assistant professor in Sans Book. I'm originally from Chile and I work on the philosophy of physics, philosophy of science, and now I'm working more and more in the philosophy of the complexity science. And I have done some work when I go into physics and what I'm interested in generally there in the statistical mechanical applications to other disciplines."
"Speaker 3","00;03;42;20","00;04;11;12","What statistical mechanical models in economics, biology and chemistry although I haven't explored that yet, I'm interested on that. And with Mattel was my I did my first exploration in the free entry principle. But just to be clear, I'm very interested in the application of statistical mechanics to other disciplines, even if we appear to be critical to that is in this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;04;13;13","00;04;14;17","Thank you, Mattel."
"Speaker 2","00;04;16;00","00;05;03;27","Thank you very much for the kind invitation and also for the spotlight on our paper. I completely undeserved. My name is Matthew Colombo. I am based in Tilburg in the Netherlands. As my accent may suggest, I'm Italian. I'm originally from Milan and mostly my walker, Eliza. And the philosophy of cognitive science. I have a special interest in computation modeling, especially reinforcement learning and Bayesian approaches to brain function and you know, it's been fun to collaborate with Patricia at this project, which are combined a bunch of interest already and and help me to learn something new."
"Speaker 2","00;05;05;17","00;05;05;28","Great."
"Speaker 1","00;05;05;28","00;05;28;04","Well, maybe we could just start with some of the context of the paper. Like, how did both of you intersect towards this very interesting view on FFP and Active? So were you studying Active Inference and then wanted to integrate it with statistical physics or vice versa? I think we heard some of the seeds of that, but it'd be good to clarify."
"Speaker 2","00;05;30;27","00;05;32;15","But these are shallow goal or."
"Speaker 3","00;05;33;07","00;05;34;05","Yeah, if you want."
"Speaker 2","00;05;34;08","00;06;15;27","Yes. OK, so I think Patricia and I started to chat about these two or three years ago at a conference probably. So my background is in plenty of neuroscience and philosophy, mainly said Masters in both and during my work at Edinburgh, as opposed the student, there was actually of course supervised by a person that Peggy Sylvia, who's an expert in Psychophysics and then she moved slowly to apply tools from Bayesian modeling of enforcement, learning, modeling to psychiatry."
"Speaker 2","00;06;16;10","00;06;53;28","And so my and my other supervisor was Andy Clark. And so it was a good, safe environment for me to learn about activity in France. I think those were the early days of this approach and started to our asking questions basically about the approach in terms of actual applications, a very limited experience. I suppose that the only serious modeling experience was during my PhD where the mother collaborated."
"Speaker 2","00;06;53;28","00;07;36;20","We started to model things in a broad based framework. This paper came to be, I think, mainly because of my own interest in Bayesian modeling and Patricia's own interest, which she just mentioned, that in the statistical physics approaches to economics and other sciences. And so we started to ask eight in terms of scientific representation, and that's the focus of our paper focus is not so much as was doing that in the paper on the metaphysics of active inference, but more about Japanese language."
"Speaker 2","00;07;36;20","00;08;38;10","Are these formalism typical representation? And let's ask what kinds of opportunities and challenges of this formalism presents when it comes to language outside, it's say, original fields, as in the, you know, statistics statistical physics. And so we started to sharpen that where the back and forth for a while. And then we see started to put into focus bodies opportunities and challenges in applying same concepts from thermodynamics and statistical physics to make sense and understand organisms and life science phenomena and what we found very interesting is this kind of tradeoff between the generality of it that it seems that the machinery of the free energy principle or active inference, we might have a discussion about the"
"Speaker 2","00;08;38;10","00;09;15;04","difference between the two and how this machinery arose allows you to call at least more many types of systems, at least allegedly but with a sacrificing plausibility, what we call realism in the paper, and again by itself destroying doubt. You don't think there is anything wrong with the, you know, going for maximal generality in an approach that might call better, you know, or at least allegedly from says up to, you know, cultural phenomena."
"Speaker 2","00;09;17;00","00;09;48;04","And that's our paper in a nutshell. That is how these tradeoffs might depend on a choice of language or formalism to make sense of allegedly any thing. And again, the thing that is one of the key terms, I think, that Marx and before him come to the car Freestone put on the map here. And I think it's a helpful way also to look at our contribution again in a nutshell."
"Speaker 2","00;09;48;04","00;10;00;28","I think the framework of the framework there might be so that the most interesting properties of the kind of thing, if there are things, say, organisms happen to be."
"Speaker 1","00;10;03;07","00;10;04;00","Thanks for that."
"Speaker 2","00;10;04;03","00;10;04;06","But."
"Speaker 1","00;10;04;18","00;10;05;10","Anything to add."
"Speaker 3","00;10;07;00","00;10;27;22","I suggest just to, to repeat what what Matteo said. So my interest in the free energy principle came from my interest in the application of statistical mechanics to other disciplines. So that's why we start discussing this and that's when I could so excited about this, about this research. And I agree with the summary of the paper that I just listed."
"Speaker 1","00;10;29;12","00;11;01;03","This thread of grounding in fundamental physics ideas and then trade offs or opportunities and challenges really became clear so maybe one general opening question What does it mean for a non statistical physics idea to be grounded in statistical physics? Like we're intrinsically talking about some interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary or applied scenario. So we're leaving that thing that field of statistical physics."
"Speaker 1","00;11;02;03","00;11;11;21","What baggage, good and bad, do we take with us? And then is it an advantage? Is it a weakness? What does it actually mean for a non physics area to be grounded in physics?"
"Speaker 3","00;11;13;25","00;11;38;05","Yeah, thank you for that question, Stephen. That's one of the questions I have motivated my research in the last years. I don't think there is a unique answer to that. So the more I do research on the applications of statistical mechanics to other disciplines, the more I understand that it varies. So it depends on how it is used, how host the decision mechanics is used and depends also on the case studies and disciplines in the specific model."
"Speaker 3","00;11;38;05","00;12;06;24","So I think that's why it's worth to look at specific case studies to specific applications of of statistical mechanics to do disciplines in order to answer that question on a case by case basis. I think in some cases the application of statistical mechanics is well justified, especially when the idea of stations are well justified. In some other cases, as I would say, I tend to think that it's the case of the free energy principle."
"Speaker 3","00;12;07;05","00;12;28;02","The application of the basic idea is to lack justification. So we are not saying or we are not concluding in the paper that that cannot be know that it doesn't make sense to propose a principle that is based on statistical mechanics, but we just think that there's much more work to be done in the justification of especially of the organizations that are involved."
"Speaker 3","00;12;28;02","00;12;33;04","When we use statistical mechanics to formulate a principle like the free energy principle."
"Speaker 1","00;12;35;28","00;13;06;03","Classic philosophy, where do we air or miss when we idealize, make ideas of or generalize specific systems or things? And what is the thing concept or the system concept in either Patricia or Matteo in either of your areas, like if you mentioned a thing or a system, what would that mean in to the disciplines that you're working with?"
"Speaker 1","00;13;06;12","00;13;11;19","And then how is it being used differently in FSP and active? And then I see Steve."
"Speaker 3","00;13;15;09","00;13;16;22","Martel, you want to answer this?"
"Speaker 2","00;13;18;03","00;13;18;22","Sure."
"Speaker 2","00;13;21;00","00;14;14;13","I mean, in a sense your question is about metaphysics and the question is what's the thing and what? And in what way we can make sense of that thing with a formalism like the format is a map of blankets, for instance, or the formalism of statistical mechanics just to turn the points like they different direction. If I may, I suppose the question about with that and the role of idealization, some which you know, Patricia just commented on is not just boiling down to the, to the conclusion that that's difficult with the let's move on to apply these tools to a certain system."
"Speaker 2","00;14;15;17","00;15;08;14","The challenge we put on the table here is concerning the generality of the general idea of the active inference approach. You know, there is an excellent work by Philip Strontium Baca and others. So using active inference models in markers decision processes with humans, feeding decisions in the reinforcement learning or decision tasks with the active inference models, and again, this is just one example of a productive use of the active inference approach which, you know, resonates with regular approaches like Bayesian modeling or reinforcement learning modeling what the we're taking issue with is."
"Speaker 2","00;15;08;28","00;15;53;13","Look, you're making claims about a maximal scope, OK, maximal scope kind of application of these approach and to sensibly apply know modest at any scale, at any scale. Even outside of the life sciences, you know, having to do with economies or things with certain assumptions must be in place in these assumptions. You know, we provide a number of examples which all involve the availability of large data sets that can constrain say, the application of the model and also background knowledge about the target."
"Speaker 2","00;15;53;24","00;16;27;01","The target system are the thing you want understand. And especially, you know, bridge is a conceptual bridges between parameters within your model and features of the actual systems that you want to represent. So these are the three, I think, challenges that we put on the map for again, the large scope or very general scope of some understanding of active inference or the free energy principle."
"Speaker 2","00;16;27;01","00;16;54;00","So this is a bit of a topic. So I didn't really answer your question about being, but at least these are motivations we had to buy this paper as in making claims about maximal scope come with commitments and these commitments, at least in the case of many or most biological systems, do not look satisfied or plausible thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;16;54;01","00;17;11;09","In a way it does maybe a little bit better, but in a way it does address this question about our models as things and their relationship to other things, perhaps the target of modeling. So, Patricia, if you want to add anything, otherwise we can go to Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;17;13;19","00;18;01;16","Just to stress some of the things that Matteo said, because I hear the session offline. I hear the session of last week and I I saw that Maxwell was concerned or pointing out that we didn't take the cases that the applications of the free energy and principle to some systems in biology seriously. And but the thing is that our claim that we did take them seriously and we mentioned them in the paper, but that doesn't contradict our own claim because our claim wasn't that the statistical mechanics cannot or the language of dynamical systems cannot be used to model biological systems."
"Speaker 3","00;18;01;16","00;18;37;17","Our claim was about the generality of this of this principle. So basically we were concerned or where we got we were casting doubt on the possibility of formulating a general principle like the free energy principle. That presupposes that all relevant biological systems can be model as random dynamic systems so just to emphasize that our claim was our concerns with the free energy based generality of this principle and not with the possibility of modeling some biological systems in that way using the language of random dynamical system."
"Speaker 1","00;18;38;22","00;18;43;22","Thank you. So, Steven, and then anyone in the live chat or anyone with a raised hand here."
"Speaker 2","00;18;45;02","00;19;12;18","Yeah, thanks. This is very interesting. Hopefully you can hear me OK. Yes. I'm curious and I know that in the the reference you make to the paper, this is life as we know it. So there is that question about suggesting that life or biological self-organization is an inevitable, an emergent property of any random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket."
"Speaker 2","00;19;13;10","00;20;04;07","And I know that in some way I sense that what they've done to try and deflate that claim in 20, 30 is maybe to go down the mathematical route. I mean, I sense that you're saying they need to maybe also go down the physics route would that would that be something that you would say like in terms of how that that statement, which has to some extent been couched over the last few years, are you saying that these the physics aspects haven't been addressed as much as the statistical aspects I can see a couple of things in that."
"Speaker 2","00;20;04;07","00;20;05;22","I leave it to you, Patricia."
"Speaker 3","00;20;06;10","00;20;06;22","Yes."
"Speaker 2","00;20;07;03","00;20;42;12","Very quickly, so one line of criticism about our paper is that, you know, the active inference approach has been evolving over time. And so we are making claims about their bodies at the end, which are just that obsolete now because, you know, from that cost detail paper, that assumption seems to be dropped and replaced with the assumption of rationality."
"Speaker 2","00;20;43;07","00;21;26;13","But then the question actually two questions. One question is why should we believe that any life size phenomenon, any organism is stationary, is what is it? What is the justification for that assumption? And the second observation would be, before I leave it to Patricia, is that even within the paper, you know, across the entire paper, which is, you know, theoretically better reached, they really made a contribution to biology in terms of a metaphor explicitly early on, they're saying, look, what we are seeing here is just a metaphorical representation."
"Speaker 2","00;21;27;11","00;21;49;07","And so in a sense, that's what we are been arguing for. It is true that you can gain these maximal generality, but at the cost of making assumptions, either good condition or such clarity now which might might not apply to biological systems thank you, Patricia."
"Speaker 3","00;21;52;10","00;22;13;24","Yeah. So to to answer Stephen's concern, I would say yes. So one of the things that we wanted to point out is that we need to focus on the on the physical foundations of the free energy principle, a little bit more than only the statistical foundations of the free energy principles where we believe we don't claim to be the only ones that focus on that."
"Speaker 3","00;22;13;24","00;22;41;08","But we believe that there is lack of literature in that sense, and we want it to contribute to to to that to fill that gap, what do we call it? So that's that's the short answer. And then about, again, the discussion that you had last last week, you saw Maxwell, I think as well, was complaining that we focus too much on the older formulations of the free energy principles that of the new relations."
"Speaker 3","00;22;41;18","00;23;15;02","And he basically said that it really doesn't play any role. It's not even mentioned in the new formulation of the free energy principle. I don't have a biological background or a background in neuroscience, and I haven't work for a long time in the free energy principle. But I do have a background in physics and I am a little bit parcel with the idea that this issue doesn't play any role in the new formulation of the free energy principle, especially because they explicitly allude to the existence of weakly mixing random dynamical systems into my knowledge, mixing systems required."
"Speaker 3","00;23;15;10","00;23;34;13","This is so implied, so I'm really not sure and I haven't seen explicitly. How can you drop the assumption of people receiving the free energy? Please. But so I think that if they if some authors working on the free energy principle could clarify to what extent or why you don't need this anymore, I think that would be helpful."
"Speaker 3","00;23;34;13","00;24;04;01","So we would be grateful for that. We wouldn't consider that as a failure. In our project. So we would consider it as a success if our paper leads to more clarity in the free energy attitude, that would be a successful paper for us. And and I think the fact that Bill Dahl, also some paper that was quoted in this discussion last week, also alludes to the older formulations of the free energy principle just shows maybe a confusion in the literature between older formulations and new formulations."
"Speaker 3","00;24;04;01","00;24;28;24","So I think, again, it would be very helpful for people interested on these, at least to to have more clarity about what has changed in this new framework, in these new formulations of the free energy principle, and to have a more consistent framework that one can work with. Because we were interested in working with the legitimate framework. We went against the free energy principle and then tried to look for the weak for the weakest argument to attack them."
"Speaker 3","00;24;28;24","00;24;52;06","So there was never no strategy. I don't have anything. I am not married against the free energy principle. I don't know anything a priori against this though. So the same with Matthew. So we are just generally interested in in this application because it can be actually potentially useful or because it has been so it has caused so much attention in the in biology."
"Speaker 3","00;24;52;06","00;25;10;22","So that's where we are interested on these in the first place, not with the idea of attacking the free energy principle. So again, if we could have a better understanding of, of why the new formulations stand required, what this is about, what are the key assumptions in the new formulations of the free energy principle? I think that would save us time."
"Speaker 3","00;25;11;13","00;25;37;16","We would be happy to look at that. So I think again, I agree that we focused mostly on the alterations of the free energy principle, but I think it was partially because papers were clear and not because we wanted to attack the weaker papers in the same light. The fact that they appeal again to the existence of weakly mixing random dynamical systems suggests for me that they still are using and revisiting."
"Speaker 3","00;25;38;08","00;26;24;28","And apart from that, this was not the only argument that we were presenting in the papers. So we also mentioned faith basis in Attractors and the new formulation still requires face basis because they need some proof really. And they, they also consider or model almost statics are non equilibrium steady states us in terms of attractors. And that again falls into our criticism because we were pointing out independently of therefore this is the assumption we were pointing out that it's very hard to model in most systems, biological system, even physical systems, perhaps stationary, non equilibrium, stationary states in terms of attractors because attractors imply some asymptotic results and it's not easy to get these asymptotic results."
"Speaker 3","00;26;25;13","00;26;53;02","And so basically that was our criticism. So we were by no means only focusing on obesity, even if it doesn't play any role in body formulation in new formulations, which is not clear to me. But even so, I would say the other points still remain and we would like to to have a clear answer to that even even if that means that we have to, I don't know, say that we were wrong in the end, but I can see it."
"Speaker 3","00;26;53;02","00;26;58;03","So if our paper leads to more clarity in the literature, that would be would be fine, we would pursue success."
"Speaker 1","00;26;59;12","00;27;31;05","Thanks for that and welcome Blue. So I'll just give one comment and then Steven. So absolutely about the evolution and changes. It's a non stationary or maybe there's a higher level of a stationary to the literature, but it's one reason why Blue and I and maybe you, if anyone listening wants to contribute seriously to this, are very interested in tracking the nomenclature and which letters are used to refer to internal and external states in which assumptions are implicit or explicit."
"Speaker 1","00;27;31;17","00;27;51;06","How does that play out with the evolution of literature in this area? So that's like something that will hopefully we'll be able to point to. Maybe it's going to be version 1.4 in this paper or you know, version 1.4, the English Gambit. We can name them like chess openings. OK, Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;27;52;15","00;28;16;08","Yeah, I think you make a good point. I mean, I think also I I do agree in that the cost of paper station parity is really given as another way in to some sort of state that gets revisited. It doesn't necessarily take out a legislative, maybe adds another potential. So there's this this question doesn't it can't just be answered from a math perspective."
"Speaker 2","00;28;16;11","00;28;53;21","I think it's is this physics reality? And maybe this is where non equilibrium chemistry starts to come in, although it's a new field. And I think that your your points are are useful in clarifying some of those questions. I suppose the question that also comes up, which is maybe less common in physics, is how much can approximation science how much can an a kind of noisy version of a city be enough?"
"Speaker 2","00;28;54;18","00;29;12;20","And at what point, you know, how many beers is it before I fall over? You know, at what point does does the active inferences process come down? I don't actually think that's necessarily been or in I don't know, physics knows quite how to handle that question."
"Speaker 1","00;29;14;13","00;29;45;07","Yes. How stringently do specific realizations or models especially if they're being evaluated on utility, how stringently must they fulfill some of the underlying frameworks? Like we talked about how the T test is built around equal variances unless you're using an equal variance version. And of course, those will never be precisely realized. But then how close to being precisely realized must or should things be maturing or."
"Speaker 1","00;29;45;07","00;30;17;17","Patricia, any thoughts but otherwise the comment that came to mind was Patricia you mentioned and it was in your 2018 paper, I think that we looked at in the zero about how there's the asymptotic characteristics and the convergence time. So that was very interesting, just that there was a, there is, it's sort of this attractor, but there was more to the attractor than just where it was."
"Speaker 1","00;30;18;07","00;30;30;22","So maybe I unpack that. And then how did you see that grafting into or relating to the comments on FP and active yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;30;31;05","00;30;57;10","That's another sorry I have to leave now. Thank you. Matteo, I thought this is, you know, it's been fun. I very sorry. You know, it lasted only 30 minutes because I saw some blue joined and I had answers to a couple of their questions in the interview sessions. About the dynamic equilibrium and why we're using transport states as active states."
"Speaker 1","00;30;57;28","00;31;14;14","Well we can do 31.3 literally any time we can do it in a year. So that's why we do decimal notation. Any time it's right. Just let us know and you're always welcome back for a gas stream presenting on current work. So good luck with your teaching responsibilities in season."
"Speaker 2","00;31;15;14","00;31;23;07","Two, January, the charge of everybody. And thanks for dropping attention cheers to Patricia Cloud there."
"Speaker 1","00;31;24;06","00;31;24;18","OK."
"Speaker 3","00;31;26;17","00;31;48;26","Yeah. So yeah, you were mentioning my 2000. I need to basically do it. Yeah. So that I think the question of us interjects is related to a question of approximation science and I'm interested in both questions and this is basically what I have done independently of the free energy principle in my research in the last in the last year."
"Speaker 3","00;31;48;27","00;32;31;15","So basically what I what I pointed out about asymptotes in the paper that you were mentioning is that in order to make a model realistic, a model that takes us into, takes into account in order to make that model realistic, we not only have to pay attention to the solutions that you get in the limit when you take a limit, you also have to pay attention to how fast that limit converges and that that could be considered relaxation time or that time that you take that that the limits need in order to to or that we need in order to achieve that limit needs to be realistic too."
"Speaker 3","00;32;31;28","00;32;53;17","So you don't want you don't only have to pay attention to the values that you take, that you that you obtain when you take a limit. You also have to check to to pay attention to that, to the rate in which you approach that limit. So that will also help you to understand how realistic is the model that you are that you are using."
"Speaker 1","00;32;55;22","00;32;59;02","And how would that tie to approximation science."
"Speaker 3","00;33;02;00","00;33;30;20","It depends. Again, some some models on the models that you're analyzing in the science that you are looking at. So if you are investigating models that use limits, then there is a very clear understanding of approximation because limits give you sort of a neat understanding of the approximations that you are using. But approximations are not always in the form of limits."
"Speaker 3","00;33;30;20","00;33;53;23","Sometimes approximations can be in the form of similarity and then saying to what extent that model is realistic, it can be a little bit more obscure. So when you're modeling size limits, then you might have a clear way of understanding to what extent your model is close to or to that to the target that you are trying to model very interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;33;54;05","00;34;32;19","So one thought that's come up in a few different context. Is it's almost like a vital ism, 1.0 and a vital ism 2.0. And the 1.0 was like, you know, is there the élan vital is there something more to it than chemistry in biology? And, you know, the synthesis X vitro or X vehicle should I say, of vitamin C for some reasons point to as an example of like demonstrating that biological molecules could arise through chemical synthesis and therefore maybe more than just vitamin C, but maybe DE could also be made in the test tube."
"Speaker 1","00;34;33;29","00;35;16;26","And now we're in a area where we're asking, OK, given the grounding of biology in physics and chemistry, 1.0, how do we go from that sort of equilibrium into homeostasis in our status and more advanced forms of predictive, higher level behavior from systems that are also composed of less strategic components? So there's going to be just like there were challenges us going from the physics of a membrane into understanding how biological systems deploy membranes."
"Speaker 1","00;35;17;19","00;35;39;12","Now we're moving upper level into the cybernetic or into the anticipatory space and asking how those very same biological systems which we've deflated away to be chemical and physical. Now, will there be another level of deflation or is this a bubble that's a little harder to pop? So Stephen and then Patricia or anyone else with thoughts."
"Speaker 2","00;35;41;00","00;36;03;16","Yeah, this is a good point about it being a bit hard. It's a pop because there's a lot of the once you get into the chemistry, there's a lot of then there's a lot of hidden states that's true of that. So there's that assumption that you pass through often maybe a transition state when you go from reactants to products, but it's going from equilibrium to equilibrium."
"Speaker 2","00;36;03;16","00;36;29;03","Either the transitions state is looked at in terms of its energy accessibility, but that's again the kind of a stable state. So this question about something circling around non equilibrium or far from equilibrium, the mix in states, which is why I think you can't I think that you say, OK, this is you can't be or something along those lines can't be ignored."
"Speaker 2","00;36;29;27","00;37;08;13","Certainly once you get into anything which is more in the liquid context. So the question comes up then is when you've got these attractors or these far from equilibrium states which are not necessarily energetically favored alone, they may be somehow in tropically favored or somehow complexity favored through these attractors anyway. Is that something around how catalysts work in and in the more sort of if you were to go in a more detailed level of modeling?"
"Speaker 2","00;37;09;21","00;37;31;24","So I wonder how your thoughts are around the sort of catalysis processes that might be happening in biological systems and how, you know, how do these far from equilibrium states facilitate these these abilities to minimize for energy."
"Speaker 1","00;37;36;02","00;37;39;28","If you have any thoughts not Patricia otherwise blue to."
"Speaker 3","00;37;40;19","00;37;44;10","I would leave that to you with us to work more on the free energy principle."
"Speaker 4","00;37;46;12","00;37;56;15","I don't know I think the assumption that I've worked more on the free energy principle is maybe kind of I don't know not not not right. I don't really have an answer."
"Speaker 1","00;37;56;17","00;37;58;06","Don't let the cat ears deceive you."
"Speaker 1","00;38;00;28","00;38;26;14","Bob, but cool questions. There's many other avenues we can go. But Patricia, what is your current research or what do you see following your work now that it came out? Like what? Where do you go from that state update to your next questions. If they're related or not, it's all good yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;38;26;14","00;38;51;29","I actually I'm thinking about applying for a pro ject, which it doesn't have to do with free energy principle, but it does have to do with applications of statistical mechanics. To biology. So I have been working for a few years. I will partly I so I just finished a book on emergence and production in physics so I have been working on a concept of emergency introduction for physical systems, especially thinking about critical phenomena."
"Speaker 3","00;38;52;19","00;39;23;19","What I want to do now is to see whether that notion of emergence and production that I suggest also works for biological systems, but I would focus on biological systems that can be model as critical phenomena which means can be model. You see the physics of face transitions. So this is what I what I have in mind though, and I intuitively think somewhere in our hypothesis is that the same concept doesn't work for biological systems, and that one needs to distinguish between them."
"Speaker 3","00;39;23;19","00;39;50;17","But I think it would be useful to look specifically at systems that can be modern as critical phenomena to see that this analogy maybe between biological systems and physical systems. So that's maybe the reason why I would focus especially on those systems that can be according to to too many faces as we model and biologically model us could become phenomena interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;39;50;24","00;40;22;12","In fact, criticality is perhaps again the language analysis will reveal in the future, but it's not a term that gets brought up in the act in an area that much it's more apt to describe assist, although in, for instance, work on neural systems, there actually is a lot of it. And so there's actually so much in the SPM and dynamical modeling literature that is not made it quite over the hill."
"Speaker 1","00;40;22;26","00;40;26;24","But I think that there's more to be said. We'll look forward to that book."
"Speaker 2","00;40;27;05","00;41;02;03","Steven Yeah, that's an interesting point in the making because you are. So is it almost like you think there's a lot of a lot of computational processes that can happen purely through phase transitions and statistical processes? Which is not quite the same as the inference process. But is it maybe more like the sort of thing you see when modes find their way to food and things like that?"
"Speaker 2","00;41;02;03","00;41;18;11","So you sort of saying there's a kind of a, a physics explanation. There's some things which doesn't require the inference process, and that could do a lot of the heavy lifting yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;41;18;16","00;41;47;03","So I am I will focus on, on, on models that use the mathematics of pace transitions with variation. So you never use exactly the same mathematics. You have to you have to make change spending on the case study that you're investigating. But I will, I will focus on, on models that that use the mathematics of phase transitions to understand biological phenomena in unexpected would be forking behavior, for example."
"Speaker 3","00;41;47;05","00;42;24;00","So there are plenty of models that use the ABC model or something like the ICI model to understand forking behavior, which is that behavior of words that seem to be emerging with respect to the behavior of individual birds and in other case studies like melding protein melding, that can be a model of a face transition. I'm going to I'm going to analyze plenty of case studies of research that have been done already in physics and in biology is in the idea would be to understand what kind of notion of emergence do you find in biological systems?"
"Speaker 3","00;42;24;00","00;42;42;13","And the question is whether that is similar to the notion of emergence that appears in in physical systems. And as I said, I intuitively think that it's not the same. But since I would look at similar case studies, I think that can show that difference between biological systems and physical systems quite, quite clearly."
"Speaker 1","00;42;43;06","00;42;44;07","Call Steven as."
"Speaker 2","00;42;44;07","00;43;10;20","I lab one thing to that. Yes, of course, nobody's going to say that. I just want to there's one thing I was curious then, is it like because this there's this interesting when I'm talking to people who've got maybe more of a chemistry background, emergence is more the emergence of interactions between things through molecules and stuff. And then you get these kind of and then you've got this more process based kind of inference, dynamical one."
"Speaker 2","00;43;11;01","00;43;26;26","So you sort of seen the way of emergence being able to do quite a lot from the kind of perspective of things interacting with each other based on rules rather than a nonlinear dynamical approach."
"Speaker 3","00;43;28;15","00;44;01;02","Both actually. So you find both the interface transitions that way. That's why phase transitions in physics have been considered as the prototype example of emergent behavior, because you find nonlinear until you find a long range correlations. And well, the interactions in most systems are local but you still have these long range correlations that require using some fancy slightly randomization methods."
"Speaker 3","00;44;01;02","00;44;27;03","For example, so you have some notion of collectivity there in phase transitions in physics, not because of long range interactions, but because of long range correlations. So it appears as if the interaction between between distant particles would be would be long range. It is not, but it appears like that because you have long range correlations so I will look at similar cases in biology that have been modeled already using physics."
"Speaker 3","00;44;27;19","00;44;47;12","And then I will try to answer whether that notion of emergence in terms of non-linearity and so on are what I suggest it's emerges. Emergent behavior in physics can also be applied to biology. And I think what but this is this is preliminary. So this is not these are not the results of my research because I will be doing that for the next years."
"Speaker 3","00;44;48;01","00;45;11;24","But preliminary thought is that you will see a different spatially with top down causation that may happen in biology. That doesn't happen in physics, but this is just preliminary. So you would try not to say too much about this because I haven't done that. I just have done the research for the project. But then the you can you can wait for this result."
"Speaker 1","00;45;12;24","00;45;13;05","Thank you."
"Speaker 4","00;45;13;21","00;45;40;04","Blue so that's super interesting. And again, something that I'm very interested in is this idea of emergence. And when you're you're studying these transitions or criticality in physics, like, for example, just to from a liquid to a gas, you know, it's easy to see on a graph this kind of inflection point of temperature where the phase transition occurs."
"Speaker 4","00;45;41;08","00;45;50;00","And I just am wondering what kind of metrics you're using to quantify emergence in your future research in biological systems."
"Speaker 3","00;45;54;19","00;46;16;06","And that dependance again, sorry that many, many times. My, my, my answer is the same, but that depends on the I'm not using a specific metric because I'm not proposing a general framework. I'm just studying like different case studies. And depending on the case study, on the kind of phase transition that I'm studying is there is the metric that's attached to it."
"Speaker 3","00;46;16;29","00;46;24;23","But I'm not I'm not suggesting a general formal framework that has a metric in itself. So I'm setting case by case."
"Speaker 4","00;46;25;17","00;46;32;12","So can you maybe provide some examples or you don't want to say it too much in biology? Uh huh."
"Speaker 3","00;46;33;26","00;46;57;05","Yeah. It's the fucking behavior. So there are different, different models that I can, you can, you can send me an email if you want and I can address you to some literature, but there are plenty of modern so fucking behavior, right? But you know that use models that are already so that sort of migrate models from physics. So some of them use a slightly revised version of the, of the icing model."
"Speaker 1","00;46;59;24","00;47;50;05","It makes me think about how the sort of initial target system, let's just say a solid to a liquid phase transition and then there also are potentially critical dynamics related to information and decision making which comes into play in active inference where you could have a non-linear relationship between information coming in and then it's in policy mode. A And then there's a phase transition to policy B, and so it's kind of like again, that vital ism 1.0, 2.0 there's going to be a lower bar, a phase transition to talk about, well, the protein folding in the cell, it's going to be a special surrounding that facilitates it to do special kind of transitions physically."
"Speaker 1","00;47;50;20","00;48;13;18","But then how do we think about higher order behavioral properties, especially when they exhibit some tantalizing similarity or analogy or metaphor like we've been discussing, but can we just take those same models and think that it's going to be as clean all the way up blue? And then Steven."
"Speaker 4","00;48;16;00","00;48;49;07","So in the flocking model, for example, like and you're talking about downward causation and something as something that you wish to study. And so I'm sure that you've maybe read the Information Theory of Individuality paper by David Krakauer and the group at the Institute. So there's a point in which, you know, this, like group of birds that's like flying around, you know, kind of chaotically assembles and forms like a flock and and flies together in like a kind of patterns way."
"Speaker 4","00;48;49;16","00;49;16;14","And so, like, I'm interested in in terms of criticality at what point is the does downward causation occur? And is that the point that then it stops being like that the ensemble becomes a group, a unit that's functional, like, you know, because it's like that's a good kind of way to look at emergence. But how do you find that point in which there's that bidirectional information flow?"
"Speaker 4","00;49;16;14","00;49;19;14","So the so that's that's maybe a better way to phrase my question."
"Speaker 3","00;49;19;20","00;49;31;21","Yeah. So I say this great. Discuss this with you. But as I said, having done the whole research, I'm happy to discuss my two issues here with both of you. But that's it."
"Speaker 4","00;49;32;00","00;49;32;15","Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;49;34;14","00;50;08;06","I saw one of the hypotheses that I have is that you might find something like I'm well known work in downward causation in biological systems I'm not sure of looking behavior would be the place to find them, work on them, but I'm thinking about them work. I've done one session in terms of cell and it might be that you need some high order properties so that so that high order properties explain some fitness and that in that way that calls somehow all the way down."
"Speaker 3","00;50;08;11","00;50;48;09","But at the micro scale, at the micro level, you observe some behavior as a result that fitness that is of course great or high. So I'm thinking about that vocalization in that in those terms, but you might find other notions of downward causation there and I might found them in doing the research now in the flocking behavior, I'm not sure, but you might think that they're the the ability of many of many birds to to go in a particular to do a particular pattern, has some some fitness associated to it."
"Speaker 3","00;50;48;09","00;51;04;19","And he saw that fitness which is fitness of a group, might explain the individual behavior. So if that's correct, then you might have a notion of done workouts and that you don't find necessarily in physics. But this is just these are preliminary intuitions."
"Speaker 1","00;51;06;06","00;51;07;08","Thank you bloop."
"Speaker 4","00;51;08;25","00;51;39;11","So like going towards like along those lines and going back maybe to the attractor. So so when there is like a the emergence of a group, does does that like rain, all of the individuals in the group like closer to a new attractive state or closer together like tighter like a tighter cluster around an attractive state or is it like the new attractor state is an emergent property of the group or how do those two fit together?"
"Speaker 4","00;51;39;11","00;51;59;06","Like in terms of fitness and you know, in biological fitness you have to be able to maintain this kind of non equilibrium steady state density so in terms of fitness of a group or a cluster and biological systems, is that that the new attractor or is there just what are your intuitions maybe about that?"
"Speaker 3","00;52;00;09","00;52;25;03","Yeah, so I wouldn't I wouldn't try to describe the notion of emergence here in terms of structures, but it may be useful in the end. But I would like to to have a notion of emergence that is that doesn't rely necessarily on attractors, because I think that finding attractive is is a hard task in biology. And some of these models don't work with that practice anyway."
"Speaker 3","00;52;25;03","00;52;40;25","So I don't I don't I don't think the notion of convergence needs to be associated. This is only to attract to maybe in some cases it would be useful to understand emergence in that sense. But I wouldn't think that it's necessary to understand emergence and sense of stuff attract."
"Speaker 4","00;52;40;28","00;53;07;21","And I agree with you. But but like the coupling of emergence maybe to fitness to me, like I link fitness to a chapter. And so it's hard for me to separate them if if fitness is linked to it active, but fitness is is not linked to or is also linked to emergence, then that that draws a line for me between emergence and chapter if that makes sense."
"Speaker 3","00;53;07;24","00;53;24;22","Yes. So that's why I will work with biologists on this project. I'm not a biologist myself, but I think that fitness can be defined also independent emotional attractors. And I would try to take those notions who we would try to adopt this those definitions."
"Speaker 1","00;53;25;12","00;53;28;21","So, Dave, just because you haven't asked the question yet then. Steve."
"Speaker 2","00;53;29;23","00;54;01;13","Yeah. One of the reasons that looking for attract, let's spend too much time looking for attractors associated with them with emergence is among the things that happens when you get emergent behavior is there is a more differentiated set of interfaces with the outer world. And because of that, there's less duplication and less resemblance among the subsystems already within the overall system."
"Speaker 1","00;54;05;01","00;54;06;14","Cool. Thank you Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;54;09;18","00;54;29;23","Yeah, that's a good point around the challenge of identifying that that attract especially if you've got this multi scale nested. I mean so you've got attractors that are only present for nanoseconds, you know, even if they're there and there's millions and billions of them then on top of that you so I can imagine that it could be really useful."
"Speaker 2","00;54;29;23","00;55;12;15","And I I'm curious how you see that, you know, the freezing of ice and the way that, you know, water becomes more dense and actually about two degrees and starts to get less dense and as it approaches freezing and then you sort of have this phase transition and I think there's a real use in that also being learned about for acts of influence because although an active influence doesn't happen directly in the field of anything to do with entropy, there's this common misconception of nick entropy as if you actually get a negative form of entropy, which is kind of in the in the kind of common usage."
"Speaker 2","00;55;12;15","00;55;47;19","But there's no such thing directly as innate entropy it is a as a negative change in entropy. You know, there can be a variation in in topic, but it's not the stable state in the same way that you get with energy. But that that I think that can be a misconception. So creeps in quite a lot. I'd be curious if I, you know, effectively, you know, there's, there's, there's a value of entropy that goes down with spooky value of entropy, which no one quite knows what's going on with the entropy."
"Speaker 2","00;55;47;19","00;56;15;20","We know there's a value for entropy, that entropy goes changes in from ice to water but you know, even Richard Feynman used to say, well, no one quite knows what's going on there. And maybe this is something that you're trying to sort of get into is what's going on in those phase transitions and these entropic changes, which doesn't have the benefit, like you say, of some agents who drive of the free energy principle to make it happen."
"Speaker 2","00;56;15;20","00;56;34;26","So I don't know what your thoughts are, but how that might even how that might be useful to help people who aren't as heavily into physics. Just think about the idea of change and entropy, because I think it's it's going to become something that more and more people are using outside of physics."
"Speaker 1","00;56;40;18","00;57;10;16","If you have any thoughts. Otherwise, just the maximum density is for C for water. And it's super, super slight, but a very interesting pattern OK, we can turn to well, if anyone wants to raise their hand or give a thought Steven, you said that the entropy as it might not exist was one thing and."
"Speaker 2","00;57;10;25","00;57;13;14","There's no such thing as entropy. Well."
"Speaker 3","00;57;13;22","00;57;41;06","Yeah. I also wanted to sorry about that. Yeah, I yeah, I also wanted to, to, to stress that in equilibrium phase transitions, if this if you don't use the notion of negative entropy, of course you use entropy and standard statistical mechanics plus randomization group methods so that my, my B and a symmetry with some of the case studies that I analyzed in biology."
"Speaker 3","00;57;41;06","00;57;43;03","But I would."
"Speaker 1","00;57;44;15","00;58;16;20","And one of the fundamental tradeoffs discussed in the paper was this generality versus the plausibility and the realism do attractors even exist or is it just as if a system is moving towards something but does, does something that is not realized exist? And so this kind of takes us to talking about whether we're describing the system as it is or rather situating the system in a broader space of how it could exist."
"Speaker 1","00;58;17;04","00;59;00;29","And that was one of the fundamental points of the paper about the challenges of discovering the appropriate face space for a biological system. So it's just cool because these are not knock down punches for fip and active, nor are they trivial. They're in that optimally informative or confusing space, you know, between zero and one probability where it does matter and where philosophy comes into play and where the the specifics of the situation come into play, we can't just simply make arguments without reference to a specific model."
"Speaker 1","00;59;01;13","00;59;17;12","But then are we trap to just describing specific models, specific papers, or are we able to go beyond that ever I'm just looking through if anyone wants to raise their hand or any about that."
"Speaker 3","00;59;17;12","00;59;42;25","Sorry. So we do raise a concern about the existence of structures. Of course, structures don't exist in nature because you need you need take in infinite limits in order to find structures in a model. And you cannot decide infinite are not realistic, right? So we can not take systems and take an infinite amount of processes. Don't take any for that amount of time."
"Speaker 3","00;59;42;25","01;00;05;05","And you cannot repeat an iteration in rendering applications of transformation infinitely many times in a realistic way. Of course, these are all idealization. But in principle I wanted to stress that we don't have we don't have a problem with that. So of course any model that uses attractors wouldn't be realistic in a way. So you will be using an idealization."
"Speaker 3","01;00;05;05","01;00;51;15","That's true, but we don't have a problem with that. If the idealization can be justified. I think in many cases, especially for example, in, in, in, in the treatment of face transitions in physics where you use limits, there's a way of justifying those limits and justifying the existence of structures. And therefore, even if you meet some realism in the model of your view of your physical system, since that idealization is justified, but that is plausible so that that that model is plausible and it's legitimate what we are what we are worrying about in the paper is that it may happen that sometimes the models that they try to model many systems in terms of structures"
"Speaker 3","01;00;51;15","01;01;18;01","are not really. So they can not justify the organizations that have been made in order to model plenty of systems in terms of attractors. So I just wanted to clarify that because we don't disagree in principle with the idea of using models that appeal to attractors, even if attractive don't exist. In reality, our problem is one with the possibility of finding structures in the first place or finding asymptotic solutions."
"Speaker 3","01;01;18;15","01;01;28;02","And the second is about the possibility of justifying the stations that are involved when you use attractors or when you appeal to attractive."
"Speaker 1","01;01;29;00","01;01;55;05","Yes. And like many other arguments in biology, it's a little bit like the anthropic principle or fallacy, depending on which side you're on. It's like you mentioned in the paper, you have to prove the existence of the attractor as well as, as we discussed, the time to convergence and then justify why certain attractors denote homeostatic states. And one biologists answer is just those are the living systems."
"Speaker 1","01;01;55;13","01;02;18;10","If the attractor weren't a homeostatic state or a high fitness state, that is not going to be an anti sea around for long. And so we can just say that if there is an attractor and indeed it's as if there's an attractor for persistent systems, that's the adaptive one period. And the second that it's not that way the system fails to exist."
"Speaker 1","01;02;18;23","01;02;27;26","So that's the sort of circular but often impenetrable tautology of selection and persistence of systems."
"Speaker 4","01;02;28;01","01;03;02;05","Blue So that's a nice transition perhaps into the question that I've had about dynamic equilibrium versus a non equilibrium steady state density. So I don't know if you want to flip to that slide, Daniel, but there's several quotes in the paper where the the I'm not sure exactly what's referred to as a dynamic equilibrium. I'm assuming that it's homeostasis but I just was wondering why."
"Speaker 4","01;03;02;05","01;03;29;05","Because a dynamic equilibrium is a reversible chemical reaction and there's nothing about homeostasis that is. I mean, there may be some things, but not everything about maintaining homeostasis is has to do with reversibility. So I just was wondering, all biological systems actively maintain a dynamic equilibrium with their environment and what is meant by that."
"Speaker 1","01;03;33;24","01;03;54;24","This was a quote from the paper about your muted Patricia. But if you have any thoughts yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;03;54;24","01;04;20;19","So sorry I was missing the screen somehow. OK, so yeah. So actually, unfortunately, my dear, I wanted to answer that in a, in a in a need way. Basically, we took these from Frank Freestone himself. So he refers in many places and he had liquidations and so on. I don't have that at the moment. I can try to look at it, but know."
"Speaker 3","01;04;20;24","01;04;43;17","So you might be right. It's not the right way of, of describing the almost steady state, but I think it's a mistake that that frees himself thus. I think so this is basically what Matthew wanted to say, and he had this quotations in the papers where he's upset. So if you want to email him, he will he will address you to those words."
"Speaker 3","01;04;43;17","01;05;16;28","But not no. So not so much in our paper. Depends on that notion. Actually, so that might be a mistake that we make, I think because to give freedom in a but not so much depends on that. So basically our criticisms have to do with the idea of modeling all biological states in terms of random dynamical systems, in understanding almost static state in terms of dynamical structures as they're described in the paper."
"Speaker 3","01;05;17;11","01;05;27;20","But we don't rely so much from the notion of dynamic equilibrium. So that might be just a loose way of the of understanding almost static states."
"Speaker 4","01;05;27;29","01;05;31;17","So it's referring to homeostasis, though, not dynamics. Yes."
"Speaker 3","01;05;31;24","01;05;34;20","OK, yes, yes, yes. To most S's. Yes. Yes."
"Speaker 1","01;05;35;20","01;05;36;24","Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;05;38;06","01;06;02;06","I mean, this could be an interesting area for the for the ontological work that's happening in the lab, because this question of, you know, is it dynamic equilibrium? I think like Blue were saying, there can can be that kind of backwards and forwards of which this may be a bit more of an arrow in one direction. And then you've maybe got the word equilibrium as opposed to non equilibrium."
"Speaker 2","01;06;03;03","01;06;34;09","And then you've got this. So he has this nice term, dynamic, cool systems, you know, and as opposed to system dynamics, which is the kind of the way that say chemistry like equilibrium work is more system dynamics with dynamic systems. And you've got this interesting thing because you got this nonlinear dynamical work happening at the sort of the physics level and this emergent property level."
"Speaker 2","01;06;34;09","01;07;08;00","And then at some point, as it appears from the organisms perspectives, we might start turning and using the language of dynamic equilibrium ecologically, you know, ecological equilibrium. And this this shift in the way that the ontologies present, which may be true because as things persist and they're interacted with as an entity as they appear to be, you know, in a in a different type of dynamic."
"Speaker 2","01;07;08;00","01;07;38;28","But we are seeing from the active influence that that dynamic may in itself be more dynamic than we perceive. So I don't know, I just thought I'd mention I don't know if we need an answer. Maybe, Daniel, you got a thought. But there's something about this shift between biology and physics at the sort of at this sort of very molecular stroke, you know, theoretical level."
"Speaker 2","01;07;39;08","01;08;07;29","And then you've got the idea of what that means for biology, and then you've got the idea of what that means for biological organisms. And maybe this is something that we've talked about. This pluralistic ontology needs to be feasible in the field because like I say, it depends a thing that was a very good point. It does depend on where your models are based and grounded thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;08;08;17","01;08;58;13","Mateo has some very interesting work on pluralism in biology and the philosophy of science. So I'd recommend people look there. Now, contingent explanations are not necessarily plural. One can be an absolutist and say it depends on the particulars. And there's only one correct story so it's an open question to what extent pluralism and particularity will coexist and agreed that at the high level as we mix metaphors, take ideas across different fields, we have to be aware of what is gained and lost, what are the challenges and opportunities of applying terms from mathematics to physics and from physics to biology and taking us all the way up and down that xkcd comic that we were looking"
"Speaker 1","01;08;58;13","01;09;27;22","at earlier. One question area, Patricia, that I had was about action in the loop. So maybe there's two parts to it. The first is just we often hear about FFP as being akin to a principle of least action. So just from a physics background, what does it mean to be a principal of least action, or what would it mean to be like a principal of least action?"
"Speaker 1","01;09;28;15","01;09;59;27","And then how does it change the formalisms or not? When we're integrating control of behavior kind of control theory, formalisms or cybernetics into ensemble modeling? Because the actions of molecules are implicit in the phase transition of the ensemble of water. But what happens when we actually have a control parameter in our equations like policy."
"Speaker 3","01;10;03;04","01;10;16;20","OK, thank you. So first of all, I did find the papers where were present uses the notion of dynamic equilibrium. So for for blue and he uses a of almost S's. But I cannot use the chart, can you?"
"Speaker 1","01;10;17;00","01;10;19;22","Oh, it's on the left side. The bottom left."
"Speaker 3","01;10;20;05","01;10;22;18","It says that enter a nickname to use to chat."
"Speaker 1","01;10;22;28","01;10;24;08","You can pick if you."
"Speaker 3","01;10;24;25","01;10;28;11","Could write it was kind of bust with this it's ok."
"Speaker 1","01;10;29;04","01;10;29;22","Me trim tab."
"Speaker 3","01;10;31;24","01;10;39;00","OK so there's sort of a password so it doesn't have to do allow everyone to write them but."
"Speaker 1","01;10;39;16","01;10;40;23","It doesn't require a title."
"Speaker 3","01;10;40;23","01;10;48;13","Inside name but the paper ok good. Those are the papers. So you can take a look at this."
"Speaker 2","01;10;48;26","01;10;49;25","So yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;10;50;24","01;11;02;23","But as I said, no, so not so much in our paper there have been some that notion of then so you might disagree with that lack of recourse. There is, but yeah, I don't blame us for that. We just."
"Speaker 1","01;11;02;25","01;11;14;08","OK nice. That was interestingly not in a peer review paper. Not that it explains everything, but he may be speaking maybe informally in this essay on peace exactly."
"Speaker 3","01;11;14;08","01;11;34;11","I think, I think it's just. Yeah. Or loose way of talking about it. And we also use it because it's useful then when you speak about dynamical attractors. So if you have a notion of dynamic equilibrium, it's just useful. But of course we when we were thinking about the there, then the proper definition of dynamical equilibrium would not."
"Speaker 1","01;11;34;21","01;11;36;10","Just return to the action question. Yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;11;36;19","01;11;40;02","OK, gosh, I got OK."
"Speaker 3","01;11;40;02","01;12;07;29","So yeah, again, so we are here. So sorry that I excuse myself from summarizing the work that presented but here we are just summarizing so we don't give a proper definition of principle of least action. We're just relying on, on, for instance, own definition and he basically in that paper of 2012, he needs the principle of, of least action in order to formulate the free energy principle."
"Speaker 3","01;12;07;29","01;12;41;04","So the principle of least action is a step, an intermediate step to formulate the free energy principle, nothing more. Then I would be more careful in talking about principles of least action in, in the in phase transitions in physics. I think you might not even require any principle of least action there. Or you might talk about those ground states as principle as sort of relying on a principle of less action, but I would be more careful about exporting that notion too to the physics of face transition."
"Speaker 1","01;12;44;19","01;13;20;15","OK, yes. So that's the first part about the principle of least action. And then just is there something that is changed markedly when we introduce these control theoretic formalisms like policy selection into physical, physically inspired or based models that entail activity like the thermal motion of particles but are not approached from a control theoretic or behavioral regulatory perspective."
"Speaker 3","01;13;25;19","01;13;28;04","Are you thinking about social systems, for example."
"Speaker 1","01;13;30;25","01;14;20;02","Perhaps different kinds of systems, but mainly just a a particular system in the way that a free energy principle for a particular physics first in 2019 work like the particle is the blanket and the internal states that's engaging in active inference let's say. And so it is implementing inference on policy, it's selecting policy, it's behaving. And so is that sort of policy selection latent within non control theoretic activity based physics models again like the thermal motion of molecules or when we introduce policy inference, does that change some of the qualities of the system."
"Speaker 3","01;14;22;20","01;14;52;07","I think so. It's an interesting question. I would need to think about that more carefully, but my intuition is studied that it changes the the way you send face transitions in physics and I think that requires change in formalism and again requires important what make an important difference in your in your model with respect to to how you modern face transitions in physics."
"Speaker 1","01;14;53;14","01;15;04;10","Thanks. I agree something changes and it's not for linear time discussion necessarily to unpack, but these are the kinds of questions that we're getting. Absolutely. So blue."
"Speaker 3","01;15;04;23","01;15;07;03","Yes, yes, I think so."
"Speaker 4","01;15;07;10","01;15;34;15","So I just want to reference the articles that you posted in the chat. So the A, I think they did say dynamic equilibrium, but like I like don't trust like op ed science writers to make correct quotations. And in the rancid paper that was cited in your paper, The Markov Blankets of Life, it specifies that dynamic equilibrium specifically is not the state of homeostasis."
"Speaker 4","01;15;34;15","01;16;00;19","It says the very existence of living systems can therefore be construed as a process of boundary conservation, where the boundary of a system is its Markov blanket. That means that the dependencies induced by the presence of a Markov blanket are what keep the system far removed from thermodynamically equilibrium, not to be confused with dynamic equilibrium so I mean, specifically, like there it's not dynamic equilibrium."
"Speaker 4","01;16;00;19","01;16;13;13","It's it's far from thermodynamic equilibrium. But but still, dynamic equilibrium is not not a part of that. And so that's why that reference was very confusing to me. And like they on paper is like, yeah, yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;16;13;26","01;16;36;05","And we made, we made the same mistake that he made without correcting. That's the way that Ramses can be. So I agree. We were talking loosely there and we were what we were having in mind was the notion of dynamical attractors. So that's why we found a dynamic equilibrium very, very like a nice term. But, but we might be talking closely there."
"Speaker 3","01;16;36;05","01;16;43;14","But as I said, so that might be a mistake, but not so much dependance on that notion."
"Speaker 4","01;16;44;06","01;16;59;09","Well, also and the notion of attractor in the, the, in the state of homeostasis is specifically a far from equilibrium, removes the space that a biological system exists in. And so it's just kind of confusing to me. I thought."
"Speaker 1","01;17;03;27","01;17;35;21","Interesting, you know, it's a challenge to say enough to identify what we're talking about, but especially when we're crossing disciplinary boundaries to know which pieces of baggage make it through one border or another, like dynamical could merely just mean involving time. But it also brings on a lot more meaning in different areas."
"Speaker 1","01;17;38;22","01;17;39;12","It's a great."
"Speaker 3","01;17;39;13","01;17;55;27","Yeah. So we talk we talk in the paper about the possibility of attractors like that change. Well, we want to try to follow in another. So we understood that loosely as a notion of dynamic equilibrium. But you're right that using the term rigorously probabilistic."
"Speaker 1","01;17;58;13","01;18;39;12","Let's turn in the sort of home stretch of however long we want to speak to the short and concise conclusion so you you in the last paragraph brought up this really interesting point about the EP as a definition for a system. And so I wondered what else could it be or might be? What might we want a framework to be other than a definition like what else in the counterfactuals of the way that this paragraph could have been written, what else could the FFP or another framework be other than a definition?"
"Speaker 1","01;18;40;19","01;18;48;03","Is that synonymous or complimentary with a description? With what other pieces come into play here?"
"Speaker 3","01;18;50;13","01;18;52;29","Can you can you repeat the question? I don't know if I understood it."
"Speaker 1","01;18;53;15","01;19;05;29","If the FFP is not a definition, what else could it be? Or other than a definition, what do we want for a full fledged principle?"
"Speaker 3","01;19;06;25","01;19;07;00","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;19;08;12","01;19;09;16","What would make it a principle?"
"Speaker 3","01;19;09;16","01;20;06;15","I think of something that can be can explain life. I can explain it. Yeah. Why, why? Why? Biological systems apparently violate the second law. Why do they stay in that far from equilibrium, steady state? I think many defenders or advocates of this of the principle understand these sort of as a principle that explain that has explanatory power, that explain them not only the existence, even the existence of living system, but especially why those living systems stay far from, from equilibrium or from from Maxwell Boltzmann equilibrium for a long time."
"Speaker 3","01;20;06;15","01;20;13;25","We're not in a steady state great point. So yeah, that's smart."
"Speaker 1","01;20;14;13","01;20;58;27","And explanation, which of course goes beyond or is complimentary to definition. Explanation is one of the key terms and themes in the history of the philosophy of science. And since an explanation is evaluated subjectively or inter subjectively like was that an adequate explanation? That's a statement about the relationship between a perceiver and the explanation itself. And so it dumps the entire mass back into the lap of almost a psycho historical perspective on science, because good explanation is about the inculturation of the person evaluating how good that explanation is."
"Speaker 1","01;20;59;07","01;21;00;21","So Stephen Alden Blue."
"Speaker 2","01;21;03;25","01;21;43;20","Yeah, I was just looking up regarding dynamical and dynamics. So dynamical the adjective means relating to the study of dynamics. And so it says a dynamic system is a system exhibiting continual change. So dynamic system is continual change. A dynamical system is a system related to the study of the dynamics that dynamical system is going to be a system working with the dynamics of a system and dynamic itself just talks about the actual fact that there's change happening."
"Speaker 2","01;21;44;08","01;22;07;25","So that's kind of that's kind of interesting and be interesting as well. Whether you get dynamical things, whether it has to be systems, you know, like the, the, the, the, the is there in that maybe where there's some sort of interest in a play between three phase transitions as well. Like maybe there's some there's a dynamic going on."
"Speaker 2","01;22;07;25","01;22;14;03","Is there a dynamic that is set in order to reverse dynamic in some way? So that that's kind of interesting."
"Speaker 1","01;22;14;11","01;22;54;24","Yes, things in processes and static versus dynamic. And then loose but acceptable in many cases use of language. And again the text modeling will be superlative when we can establish where these adjectives and nouns and verbs are being used appropriately. Versus inappropriately or at the very least suggesting more precision or less precision than warranted. So blue oh, Dave has a great comment there."
"Speaker 1","01;22;54;24","01;23;10;19","Historical examined by historians using founded methods versus historic, which is like about the event itself. Like it was a historic victory or something like that. So it's interesting how we give the disciplinary nod with that Al on the adjective."
"Speaker 4","01;23;14;02","01;24;04;06","I was just thinking about the difference like linguistically between historic and historic. Like what might what might that be? So my question unrelated to historic sentence hysterics really goes back to what Patricia was saying about the second lot and touches back to what Stephen was saying earlier about the the nonexistence of negative entropy. And I'm curious about that because I think, you know, a lot of the steps is is grounded in information dynamics which depend greatly on the existence of negative entropy, like the minimization of surprise in the terms of information theory."
"Speaker 4","01;24;04;06","01;24;29;26","So I was wondering if physics and information theory are different. Are they one in the same what are the differences? How do we clarify them? And similarly, you know, one of the claims in the paper is to pay attention to the differences between physics and biology. And, you know, I've always thought that the laws of physics are universally applicable, and perhaps they're not."
"Speaker 4","01;24;29;26","01;24;56;00","But but I think that they should be. And, you know, this defiance of the second law, like, ah, do the laws of physics not apply in biology and biological systems? And it's is it's negative entropy that that biological systems do. I mean, Scott David always classically refers to the entropy secretion of, you know, biological systems. And so I just was wondering how do we reconcile these differences?"
"Speaker 4","01;24;56;00","01;24;57;24","Maybe because that's."
"Speaker 1","01;24;58;14","01;25;01;18","Got great questions. Stephen, you want to go on that topic or."
"Speaker 2","01;25;02;11","01;25;47;22","Yeah, I think I think this is really good. I think this is important because you see neg entropy kind of is a bit like a negative enthalpy in the way it's formulated. I but the thing is, you have a reduction only relative to starting state start in equilibrium state in terms of entropy. It's it might have gone down in terms of a start and state, but it's not actually lower in an energy is energy right you it can't be made can't be lost, you know, but the entropy you can have in variation in the entropy and the variation can be noisy going up and down."
"Speaker 2","01;25;47;22","01;26;29;26","You can then extract information, you can have things which are more ordered. Now that's fair enough. You can have more order but neg entropy isn't something which is a value in that way. It's just a convenient piece of temporary mathematics to help see whether you're going to have a force driving or reducing a reaction, which. So that's where the challenge is because it's you're guessing it from the variations, not from something which is an equilibrium state."
"Speaker 2","01;26;29;26","01;26;47;12","Because as soon as you say neg entropy makes it sound like it's sitting there with a particular amount of entropy that makes sense and it's not really like that. So this, this is, this is like one of the kind of misplaced misunderstandings I think it rounds entropy."
"Speaker 1","01;26;50;00","01;27;31;26","OK, interesting. One other view blue on your question about information and thermodynamics. We have some very slam dunk info, thermo synthesis on the processor scale, like the amount of heat that is emitted or absorbed by certain very, very granular atomic in multiple senses, informational transitions and so it's almost like that's like the, the stem and there's that. We know that there is a connection there either as if to be sure, if not in actuality."
"Speaker 1","01;27;32;03","01;28;06;10","So map and territory information thermodynamics potentially coming together and part of our curiosity and drive with active inference is whether info dynamics might apply to higher orders of organization and whether we can use some of these models and ideas to describe informational patterns and thermodynamic eventually even bioenergy stick patterns and phenomena beyond the CPU. And that's where it's going to be."
"Speaker 1","01;28;06;10","01;28;39;23","This question of OK, maybe we generalize and it's useful, but we've lost some reality touch. So the parameter a temperature parameter on decision making doesn't refer to the thermometer reading of the brain. I think we're OK with that so in a way, we are lifting away from the physical grounding because we're using terms like temperature entropy in their information and not their physical capacity."
"Speaker 1","01;28;40;21","01;29;11;05","And as the key questions raised in this paper brought to this discussion, there are opportunities and challenges with making those kinds of generalizations. It's not just a simple win, it's things are gained, things are lost. Some things come into resolution, other things become incapable of being resolved. So that's like the some of the excellent questions that I think the paper brings to the table."
"Speaker 1","01;29;11;19","01;29;42;07","And it combines those questions along with just tantalizingly a look at the history and the development of active inference as a framework. And so we can be clear about which papers said what, when, and then where are we headed, what would be our preferences for a thermodynamic model of decision making? Will we only succeed when it's about the temperature of the brain?"
"Speaker 1","01;29;44;01","01;30;18;28","It might be for some person. However, other people might just say if there is a temperature like parameter in the sense that that parameters formalism looks like temperature of water in a test tube, then we have something that's already useful and interesting and that's where the train ends for me. And then somebody else may continue to build the rails off towards wondering whether is it metaphysically a temperature of decision making, all these other areas that people can take it."
"Speaker 1","01;30;20;16","01;31;07;09","And so it's the trade off between realism for generality and utility that we've come to these meta modeling discussions before in number 14 and beyond OK, anyone wants to ask a question in the chat or raise their hand here. Otherwise, let's see back to our dot one questions and see if there's any threads from dot one that we want to just recap or see if we have a different perspective on and then we can just sort of close the dot two and jump off into the next steps."
"Speaker 1","01;31;07;09","01;31;46;19","So in one, we started with some questions again from the more history of FFP and active about in what ways has physics been used to investigate the FFP? We talked a little bit about how the cost of paper that was 26 B.C mechanics for stationary processes relates to the city stationary discussion or not. We'll see we talked about then and also a little bit today, is the FFP a theory of life?"
"Speaker 1","01;31;46;22","01;31;52;16","Well, in the conclusion it was said to be a definition and we talked about some other things. It could be blue."
"Speaker 4","01;31;56;26","01;32;00;05","So I still have to unmute. You'd think I would learn after all this time."
"Speaker 1","01;32;00;21","01;32;01;07","Never learned."
"Speaker 4","01;32;01;07","01;32;26;05","Don't change the the urgency thing. I think maybe you guys discuss that before I got here. But, but I think like one of the, the points that was made in this paper addressing the ERG, the city and the fact that you know, biological systems are I mean, I don't think I can I don't think biological systems can be described as as ergodic."
"Speaker 4","01;32;26;05","01;32;56;26","And this is a discussion that Daniel and I have had many times. I mean, sure. Within a very restricted space, like, you know, by body temperature, for example, in the range from I mean, can I survive like 105 Fahrenheit probably and you know, maybe 95 Fahrenheit. So I have like this ten degree range. And I'm sure at some point in my lifetime I will visit all the space within that range because you can't skip over you don't go from 96 to 100 and skip any of the points in between."
"Speaker 4","01;32;56;26","01;33;34;23","So like, you know, it's incrementally like of course a visit, all of that space. And so I do think that, that, that's an important question. But yeah, that, that was really addressed by Acosta in that 26 livestream about, you know, homeostasis is a quasi stationary because it's not perfectly stationary. Right. It's like a, it's a squishy stationary, but it's not, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't sample the entire we don't sample the entire state space of say temperature, you know, as a biological system that must maintain a certain temperature."
"Speaker 4","01;33;34;23","01;33;39;02","So I think that that was resolved but did you guys discuss that before I got here?"
"Speaker 1","01;33;41;08","01;33;51;07","Not the bounded ness per se, but potentially some relevant pieces about the city and stationary."
"Speaker 3","01;33;52;28","01;34;35;19","Yeah. So may I say something? Sorry that I had to turn off the video am with my baby here. Hello, baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we didn't we? I agree with you. I think that's one of the things that we that we discussed in the paper. So it's very problematic to understand biological systems such as body systems. But in the discussion last week you were saying or Maxwell was saying that new formulations of the free energy principles don't rely on that assumptions that they dropped that assumption in the new formulations of the free energy principle and what I was saying before today is that it's still in new formulations of the free energy principle."
"Speaker 3","01;34;36;05","01;35;02;13","They rely on the existence of weakly mixing random dynamical systems, and to my understanding, mixing systems required implicitly anyhow. So it's not clear that they have really dropped the assumption in the new formulations. And if so, I would like to see exactly how this framework will work without the assumption of implicitly. I haven't seen that explicitly. I, I my believe that that can be done, but I would like to, to cede."
"Speaker 1","01;35;05;07","01;35;22;25","And we don't evade requirements just by not mentioning them. So it's about what papers do mention as well as reading between the lines between the formalisms, between the citations to really what is the bedrock or tautology that the theories rest upon."
"Speaker 2","01;35;23;00","01;36;01;08","Stephen You know, I think this also might point to your cybernetics point, Daniel, and in the sense of, you know, where does something happen, this kind of early uptake process of mixed in and where may happen through a higher level cybernetic mechanism that the organism has that is enabled by sort of ergodic act of inference or whatever processes are emergent."
"Speaker 2","01;36;01;25","01;36;37;08","But the fact that it's emerged from ergodic processes at multiple nested levels doesn't necessarily mean that some of the high level ways of keeping something within bounds then has to follow that because, you know, you can create a system out of all the cells that are doing their thing, so to speak. They'll be in their thing. So we we this is where it can maybe be that danger that yeah, there's an extension of a certain process."
"Speaker 2","01;36;37;08","01;36;54;27","It's like, OK, where does something which is relying on ergodic processes or some other approaches able to give way to another type of control theory?"
"Speaker 1","01;36;56;26","01;37;09;12","Yes. And over short time horizons, is it possible to have sensory motor loops that work, whether or not some infinite case is what it rests upon?"
"Speaker 4","01;37;09;13","01;37;48;11","Blue So Patricia, I'm curious to know or to know what you think about if you've read the de Costa Paper about Bayesian, Bayesian theory processes for Bayesian forces, Bayesian mechanics for stationary passes. Vega So I'm curious to know if you've read that and what you felt was perhaps lacking from that mathematical description to meet the requirements that you were referring to for mixing systems and a city yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;37;48;11","01;38;08;03","Thank you. I did look at that, but we explicitly wanted to focus on other assumptions, not on the Bayesian assumptions of the paper. We didn't also mention the Markov blanket assumption, which is, quote, a core assumption in the free energy principle. And we left that out deliberately. First of all, because of lack of space, the paper is long enough."
"Speaker 3","01;38;08;16","01;38;29;16","Second, because there is much more literature on that than on these other assumptions that we discuss in our paper. So I think this formulation of, well, I don't have that paper on the top of my head, but I think they, again, rely on weakly mixing dynamical systems in the paper. Right. They don't."
"Speaker 1","01;38;30;24","01;38;31;10","We can."
"Speaker 3","01;38;31;23","01;38;45;07","Check they they use that framework so I think to the extent that they use that framework, if I'm not mistaken, then the same criticisms applied. You need to apply in faith basis and you need the existence of attractive or at least."
"Speaker 2","01;38;49;18","01;38;50;01","Cool."
"Speaker 1","01;38;51;28","01;39;20;14","I just imagined, like these networks of citations, like a, some sort of biological metaphor, some swarm of citations with words being traced between them and connections of the words. And I think we're in the boutique artisan, the farmer's market phase of these kinds of analyzes. And there there will be a time not so far away when these questions can be resolved better blue."
"Speaker 4","01;39;23;14","01;39;47;00","So yeah, just like the paper aside, I mean, I definitely realize that there's space constraints and also like, what was the timing of your paper versus the cost of paper? And did you have time to, like, incorporate all of those the new, like, updated version of the math so there's not weekly mixing or mixing mentioned in the cost of paper."
"Speaker 4","01;39;47;00","01;40;13;12","And so I really just would be curious, maybe you want to follow up via email to to know what what was missing from that that formulation and in your mind, for it to be plausible? Because for me, too, it was very like the foundation of the FCP existing in in regard to city or requiring or the city for applicability was very jarring."
"Speaker 4","01;40;13;20","01;40;31;11","Like I felt like that's, that can't be right. But I felt that it was really resolved by the cost of paper. And so I'm curious if you don't feel the same way, what your hesitation would be. So maybe we want to follow up and at some point."
"Speaker 3","01;40;32;05","01;41;06;11","Yeah, maybe. Or maybe by email. So I would definitely look at this paper and other new research because that was published this year, right? It's very recent. So the papers that we were focusing a little bit more on in the, in our baby was part of it. Which is also very new and present 2019. This put this free energy principle for particle physics and the other papers we look at them very briefly because they were actually out after our paper was accepted or maybe during the review process."
"Speaker 3","01;41;06;11","01;41;28;14","So it wasn't part of our research systematic research but we did take a look at them. I think we may have even caught that paper but yeah. So I would like to take a look at that. Again, I'm not sure whether they use if they use the notion of information geometry, then they're probably also relying on weekly dynamical systems."
"Speaker 3","01;41;28;14","01;41;33;21","But I would have to look at that again so we can continue the conversation by."
"Speaker 1","01;41;37;03","01;42;07;27","Counterfactual paper spaces. You know, you have some sort of clause that gets triggered if something happens in the literature then this paragraph should be deleted, like pending a future word on this. This could be deleted in the last little bit. Maybe we can just have any thoughts. Just why does this whole discussion matter for the FSP and for active?"
"Speaker 1","01;42;08;10","01;42;36;00","Well, the validity and the adequacy were how it was described by this paper, why it it matters. So it's kind of cool because often the citations that we discuss, they don't always lay out on the table why it matters to understand this topic. And I think we got that very clearly from this work. So I really appreciate that."
"Speaker 1","01;42;36;00","01;42;55;19","And it also laid out many of the next steps directly, not every next step, but the specific key themes and challenges are addressed. And if there is a obvious or non obvious response that'll be a citation that somebody can swoop on."
"Speaker 2","01;42;56;01","01;43;43;04","Stephen Yeah, I think it's important because we are seeing a lot of interest and a huge amount of interest in activism and embodied work and physicality and how these things can shape up and therefore your mathematical arguments will limit things. I think getting into the nitty gritty of the physics, which in itself is best in with some of this because it's kind of cutting edge for them in terms of that is really important I think, because you see some of the criticisms coming around in activism and trying to get arrested on things."
"Speaker 2","01;43;43;04","01;44;18;19","And I do think I will say that I think maybe sometimes saying go visit the map, which is ultimately based in this city, which is basically a physics principle as much as a math principle in terms of how that comes to be present comes up. So I think this is this is a really important area that physics and and maybe the so at the areas of applied physics start to come into yes."
"Speaker 1","01;44;19;00","01;44;34;18","And we'll just send them on the run around. OK, go to the math and I'll go to the physics. OK, now to the philosophers. You go and then back to another maybe non academic department. Is that run around the answer? What if there is a station charity in the run around."
"Speaker 2","01;44;36;08","01;44;36;16","But."
"Speaker 1","01;44;37;25","01;45;16;23","Very good points it's kind of fun because we've had these questions for a long time, if not the longest time yet. Many of them were explicitly addressed by this paper and by the 31 discussions so that's kind of cool to see, like a sort of it's not a conclusion on our series, but these, these questions which are often the next step for other papers discussed in the DOT to discuss the, the conclusion or the discussion."
"Speaker 1","01;45;17;06","01;45;38;00","That's where this work picked up. And so that that's a, a different attribute than we've seen from some of the other literature we discussed Blue. Dave, do you have any other thoughts? Patricia would you like to give any final comments."
"Speaker 3","01;45;42;01","01;45;46;04","I think I have said, you know, unless you have a last question."
"Speaker 1","01;45;48;03","01;45;48;27","What papers."
"Speaker 3","01;45;48;27","01;46;13;22","I am, I am a little bigger print. Sorry, I'm a little bit of an outsider in the free energy principle, I must confess. But I I would like to see how it progress. So I say, as I said at the beginning, we are not against the free energy principle Apriori. So if our paper can lead to more research in the free energy principle direction, we would be happy and we would consider it a success."
"Speaker 3","01;46;13;22","01;46;35;21","So we are not necessarily enemies of the free energy principle and I'm in principle very interested in the application of statistical mechanics and even the language of dynamical systems to biology. So I am in principle interested in this type of research and also in the active in, for instance, interdisciplinary research. So I would be very interested in see how this evolved."
"Speaker 3","01;46;35;28","01;46;43;14","And if we as philosophers can contribute to that by criticizing some points that we find non rigorous enough, then our job."
