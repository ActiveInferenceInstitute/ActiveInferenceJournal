"00;00;08;16","00;00;09;09","and welcome"
"00;00;09;09","00;00;11;18","to the Active Inference Lab today."
"00;00;11;18","00;00;14;13","It's October 26th 2021,"
"00;00;15;01","00;00;16;22","and we're in active live"
"00;00;16;22","00;00;19;28","stream number 31.2."
"00;00;19;28","00;00;22;00","Welcome to the Active Lab."
"00;00;22;00","00;00;24;01","We are a participatory online lab"
"00;00;24;02","00;00;25;07","that is communicating,"
"00;00;25;07","00;00;27;00","learning and practicing"
"00;00;27;00","00;00;28;14","applied active inference."
"00;00;28;14","00;00;29;26","You can find us at the links"
"00;00;29;26","00;00;32;00","here on this slide."
"00;00;32;00","00;00;32;28","This is a recorded"
"00;00;32;28","00;00;34;11","and an archived live stream."
"00;00;34;11","00;00;36;00","So please provide us with feedback"
"00;00;36;00","00;00;38;17","so that we can improve our work."
"00;00;38;17","00;00;39;16","All backgrounds"
"00;00;39;16","00;00;41;21","and perspectives are welcome here"
"00;00;41;21","00;00;42;15","and we'll be following"
"00;00;42;15","00;00;45;23","good video etiquette for livestreams"
"00;00;45;23","00;00;47;25","we're here in our second discussion"
"00;00;48;04","00;00;50;05","group discussion for 31"
"00;00;50;05","00;00;51;12","towards the end of October."
"00;00;51;12","00;00;53;15","So also happy Halloween"
"00;00;53;15","00;00;55;23","and this is our jumping off"
"00;00;55;23","00;00;57;17","point to many ideas."
"00;00;57;17","00;00;59;05","So looking forward to this"
"00;00;59;05","00;01;01;03","cool discussion."
"00;01;01;05","00;01;03;29","The goal is going to be to learn"
"00;01;03;29","00;01;07;09","and discuss this paper by Patricia"
"00;01;07;09","00;01;08;25","Palacios and Mateo Colombo,"
"00;01;08;25","00;01;10;14","both of whom are with us today."
"00;01;10;14","00;01;12;07","So thanks so much to the authors"
"00;01;12;07","00;01;15;08","for joining and feel free to address"
"00;01;15;08","00;01;16;15","what you can while you're here"
"00;01;16;15","00;01;17;15","and then just leave"
"00;01;17;15","00;01;19;13","whatever works for you."
"00;01;19;13","00;01;22;20","And in this discussion we can take it"
"00;01;22;26","00;01;23;26","many different ways"
"00;01;23;26","00;01;25;08","because so many topics"
"00;01;25;08","00;01;26;11","came up in the dot"
"00;01;26;11","00;01;27;14","zero and dot one,"
"00;01;27;14","00;01;30;11","but we have all of the formalisms"
"00;01;30;11","00;01;31;12","some big questions,"
"00;01;31;12","00;01;32;03","a lot of topics"
"00;01;32;03","00;01;35;04","that we raised in the 31.1 video"
"00;01;35;04","00;01;35;19","as well."
"00;01;37;02","00;01;38;06","So we can begin with"
"00;01;38;06","00;01;39;29","an introduction and warm up section."
"00;01;39;29","00;01;42;00","We'll have the non authors"
"00;01;42;10","00;01;43;19","introduce themselves"
"00;01;43;19","00;01;44;28","and then just say Hello."
"00;01;44;28","00;01;46;24","And then we'll pass to the two authors,"
"00;01;46;24","00;01;48;01","both of whom are joining"
"00;01;48;01","00;01;49;28","for the first time to a stream."
"00;01;49;28","00;01;50;23","So again,"
"00;01;50;23","00;01;52;15","thanks for joining"
"00;01;52;15","00;01;55;01","and we look forward to the discussion"
"00;01;55;01","00;01;56;13","So I'm Daniel, I'm"
"00;01;56;13","00;01;58;23","a researcher in California."
"00;01;58;23","00;02;00;29","And to just add something"
"00;02;01;00","00;02;02;08","I'm excited about,"
"00;02;02;08","00;02;03;17","Mateo and I were just discussing"
"00;02;03;17","00;02;04;28","right before we started"
"00;02;04;28","00;02;07;04","some of the sociology"
"00;02;07;04","00;02;09;29","meets history and philosophy of science"
"00;02;11;17","00;02;12;19","and oh yeah, who could forget"
"00;02;12;19","00;02;14;11","about the actual topics themself"
"00;02;14;11","00;02;16;12","so there's just some cool intersections"
"00;02;16;12","00;02;18;13","that we'll be able to talk about"
"00;02;18;13","00;02;21;09","all pass it to Dave"
"00;02;22;00","00;02;24;00","Hi, I'm retired from"
"00;02;24;00","00;02;25;24","Information Technology."
"00;02;25;24","00;02;27;14","I'm in the cool"
"00;02;27;14","00;02;28;20","dry mountains"
"00;02;28;20","00;02;30;20","of the northern Philippines."
"00;02;30;20","00;02;32;11","And now that I don't have to work"
"00;02;32;11","00;02;33;19","for a living, I'm"
"00;02;33;19","00;02;34;23","getting really busy"
"00;02;34;23","00;02;36;07","on learning cybernetics,"
"00;02;36;07","00;02;37;11","which is one"
"00;02;37;11","00;02;39;11","of the things I did back in college"
"00;02;39;11","00;02;40;24","and having a great time"
"00;02;40;24","00;02;41;22","this fired up"
"00;02;41;22","00;02;44;08","about having a complexity weekend ramp"
"00;02;44;08","00;02;46;11","up starting tomorrow."
"00;02;47;11","00;02;47;29","So true."
"00;02;47;29","00;02;49;06","Stephen"
"00;02;52;15","00;02;52;26","we can't"
"00;02;52;26","00;02;54;12","hear you, Stephen, but you're unmuted,"
"00;02;54;12","00;02;57;21","so maybe your audio selection is odd,"
"00;02;58;09","00;02;59;24","but let's"
"00;03;00;17","00;03;01;27","welcome Stephen back."
"00;03;01;27","00;03;03;15","So figure it out"
"00;03;03;15","00;03;06;08","and let's go to Patricia first."
"00;03;06;08","00;03;07;13","Welcome and happy"
"00;03;07;13","00;03;10;24","to hear your introduction."
"00;03;10;24","00;03;11;07","Hello."
"00;03;11;07","00;03;11;15","Well,"
"00;03;11;15","00;03;13;18","thank you for the discussion"
"00;03;13;18","00;03;15;01","about the interest"
"00;03;15;01","00;03;17;03","in discussing our paper."
"00;03;17;03","00;03;17;23","So I'm an assistant"
"00;03;17;23","00;03;19;07","professor in Sans Book."
"00;03;19;07","00;03;21;07","I'm originally from Chile"
"00;03;21;07","00;03;23;21","and I work on the philosophy of physics,"
"00;03;23;21","00;03;25;12","philosophy of science,"
"00;03;25;12","00;03;27;16","and now I'm working more"
"00;03;27;16","00;03;28;22","and more in the philosophy"
"00;03;28;22","00;03;30;18","of the complexity science."
"00;03;30;18","00;03;33;00","And I have done some work"
"00;03;33;00","00;03;34;19","when I go into physics"
"00;03;34;19","00;03;36;22","and what I'm interested"
"00;03;36;22","00;03;38;21","in generally there in the statistical"
"00;03;38;21","00;03;40;14","mechanical applications"
"00;03;40;14","00;03;42;21","to other disciplines."
"00;03;42;21","00;03;45;01","What statistical mechanical models"
"00;03;45;12","00;03;47;25","in economics, biology"
"00;03;48;10","00;03;49;29","and chemistry"
"00;03;49;29","00;03;51;05","although I haven't explored that"
"00;03;52;10","00;03;54;21","yet, I'm interested on that."
"00;03;54;21","00;03;56;29","And with Mattel was my"
"00;03;57;08","00;03;59;07","I did my first exploration"
"00;03;59;07","00;04;01;28","in the free entry principle."
"00;04;01;28","00;04;03;29","But just to be clear,"
"00;04;03;29","00;04;05;19","I'm very interested in the application"
"00;04;05;19","00;04;07;09","of statistical mechanics"
"00;04;07;09","00;04;08;09","to other disciplines,"
"00;04;08;09","00;04;10;03","even if we appear to be critical to"
"00;04;10;03","00;04;12;22","that is in this paper."
"00;04;13;13","00;04;15;22","Thank you, Mattel."
"00;04;16;01","00;04;18;03","Thank you very much for"
"00;04;18;03","00;04;19;04","the kind invitation"
"00;04;19;04","00;04;22;17","and also for the spotlight on our paper."
"00;04;22;21","00;04;24;20","I completely undeserved."
"00;04;24;20","00;04;26;22","My name is Matthew Colombo."
"00;04;26;22","00;04;28;01","I am based"
"00;04;28;01","00;04;30;08","in Tilburg in the Netherlands."
"00;04;30;08","00;04;33;05","As my accent may suggest, I'm Italian."
"00;04;33;18","00;04;35;08","I'm originally from Milan"
"00;04;35;08","00;04;38;01","and mostly my walker, Eliza."
"00;04;38;04","00;04;40;12","And the philosophy of cognitive science."
"00;04;40;20","00;04;41;28","I have a special interest"
"00;04;41;28","00;04;43;19","in computation modeling,"
"00;04;43;19","00;04;45;00","especially reinforcement"
"00;04;45;00","00;04;48;00","learning and Bayesian approaches"
"00;04;48;00","00;04;49;29","to brain function"
"00;04;50;15","00;04;52;23","and you know, it's been fun"
"00;04;53;05","00;04;55;00","to collaborate with Patricia"
"00;04;55;00","00;04;56;16","at this project, which are"
"00;04;57;22","00;05;00;02","combined a bunch of"
"00;05;00;06","00;05;01;04","interest already"
"00;05;01;04","00;05;03;28","and and help me to learn something new."
"00;05;05;17","00;05;05;28","Great."
"00;05;05;28","00;05;06;16","Well,"
"00;05;06;16","00;05;08;13","maybe we could just start with"
"00;05;08;13","00;05;10;09","some of the context of the paper."
"00;05;10;09","00;05;12;16","Like, how did both of you"
"00;05;12;24","00;05;13;28","intersect towards"
"00;05;13;28","00;05;17;20","this very interesting view on FFP"
"00;05;17;20","00;05;18;10","and Active?"
"00;05;18;10","00;05;20;21","So were you studying Active Inference"
"00;05;20;29","00;05;22;10","and then wanted to integrate it"
"00;05;22;10","00;05;24;19","with statistical physics or vice versa?"
"00;05;24;25","00;05;25;09","I think we"
"00;05;25;09","00;05;26;24","heard some of the seeds of that,"
"00;05;26;24","00;05;29;14","but it'd be good to clarify"
"00;05;30;28","00;05;33;07","but these are shallow goal or."
"00;05;33;07","00;05;34;08","Yeah, if you want."
"00;05;34;08","00;05;34;17","Yes."
"00;05;34;17","00;05;36;04","OK, so"
"00;05;36;04","00;05;37;12","I think"
"00;05;37;12","00;05;38;29","Patricia and I started to chat"
"00;05;38;29","00;05;40;17","about these two"
"00;05;40;17","00;05;42;17","or three years ago at a conference"
"00;05;43;07","00;05;44;09","probably."
"00;05;44;09","00;05;46;11","So my background"
"00;05;47;00","00;05;47;20","is in"
"00;05;47;20","00;05;50;28","plenty of neuroscience and philosophy,"
"00;05;51;13","00;05;52;09","mainly said"
"00;05;52;09","00;05;53;10","Masters in both"
"00;05;53;10","00;05;55;25","and during my work at Edinburgh,"
"00;05;56;11","00;05;57;05","as opposed"
"00;05;57;05","00;05;57;22","the student,"
"00;05;57;22","00;05;59;06","there was actually of course"
"00;05;59;06","00;06;01;11","supervised by a person"
"00;06;01;12","00;06;03;20","that Peggy Sylvia,"
"00;06;03;20","00;06;06;09","who's an expert in Psychophysics"
"00;06;06;29","00;06;11;01","and then she moved slowly to apply tools"
"00;06;11;01","00;06;12;17","from Bayesian"
"00;06;12;17","00;06;13;21","modeling of enforcement,"
"00;06;13;21","00;06;15;27","learning, modeling to psychiatry."
"00;06;16;10","00;06;19;06","And so my and my other supervisor was"
"00;06;19;25","00;06;21;02","Andy Clark."
"00;06;21;02","00;06;22;08","And so it was a good,"
"00;06;24;08","00;06;25;09","safe"
"00;06;25;26","00;06;27;22","environment for me"
"00;06;27;22","00;06;30;21","to learn about activity in France."
"00;06;30;21","00;06;33;05","I think those were the early days"
"00;06;34;06","00;06;35;22","of this approach"
"00;06;35;22","00;06;37;20","and started to our asking questions"
"00;06;37;20","00;06;40;10","basically about the approach in terms of"
"00;06;40;26","00;06;42;16","actual applications,"
"00;06;42;16","00;06;44;23","a very limited experience."
"00;06;44;23","00;06;46;06","I suppose that"
"00;06;46;07","00;06;49;09","the only serious modeling experience"
"00;06;49;16","00;06;52;05","was during my PhD"
"00;06;52;05","00;06;53;28","where the mother collaborated."
"00;06;53;28","00;06;56;26","We started to model things in"
"00;06;57;21","00;07;00;25","a broad based framework."
"00;07;00;25","00;07;02;26","This paper came to be,"
"00;07;02;26","00;07;04;26","I think, mainly because"
"00;07;05;05","00;07;08;00","of my own interest in Bayesian"
"00;07;08;00","00;07;10;14","modeling and Patricia's own interest,"
"00;07;11;00","00;07;12;21","which she just mentioned, that"
"00;07;12;21","00;07;15;00","in the statistical physics approaches"
"00;07;15;26","00;07;17;27","to economics and other sciences."
"00;07;18;09","00;07;20;19","And so we started to ask eight"
"00;07;21;17","00;07;23;23","in terms of scientific representation,"
"00;07;23;23","00;07;25;24","and that's the focus of our paper focus"
"00;07;26;01","00;07;27;28","is not so much"
"00;07;28;01","00;07;29;21","as was doing that"
"00;07;29;21","00;07;31;29","in the paper on the metaphysics"
"00;07;32;08","00;07;33;28","of active inference,"
"00;07;33;28","00;07;36;20","but more about Japanese language."
"00;07;36;20","00;07;38;04","Are these formalism"
"00;07;38;04","00;07;39;25","typical representation?"
"00;07;39;25","00;07;40;20","And let's ask"
"00;07;40;20","00;07;42;24","what kinds of opportunities"
"00;07;42;24","00;07;45;04","and challenges of this formalism"
"00;07;45;24","00;07;48;03","presents when it comes to language"
"00;07;48;13","00;07;52;24","outside, it's say, original fields,"
"00;07;53;03","00;07;55;14","as in the, you know, statistics"
"00;07;55;14","00;07;57;07","statistical physics."
"00;07;57;07","00;07;58;27","And so we started to sharpen"
"00;07;58;27","00;08;01;08","that where the back and forth"
"00;08;01;08","00;08;02;21","for a while. And then we"

"00;08;11;22","00;08;15;12","same concepts from thermodynamics"

"00;08;21;26","00;08;24;01","science phenomena and what"
"00;08;25;06","00;08;26;17","we found very interesting"
"00;08;26;17","00;08;28;11","is this kind of tradeoff"
"00;08;28;11","00;08;30;04","between the generality of it"
"00;08;30;04","00;08;32;13","that it seems that the machinery"

"00;08;33;26","00;08;36;08","principle or active inference,"
"00;08;36;08","00;08;37;15","we might have a discussion"
"00;08;37;15","00;08;40;14","about the difference between the two"
"00;08;41;07","00;08;43;13","and how this machinery arose"
"00;08;43;22","00;08;45;29","allows you to"
"00;08;45;29","00;08;48;08","call at least more"
"00;08;49;17","00;08;51;22","many types of systems,"
"00;08;51;22","00;08;53;13","at least allegedly"
"00;08;53;13","00;08;56;04","but with a sacrificing plausibility,"
"00;08;56;21","00;08;59;07","what we call realism in the paper,"
"00;08;59;13","00;09;01;11","and again by itself destroying doubt."
"00;09;01;11","00;09;02;03","You don't think there is"
"00;09;02;03","00;09;05;12","anything wrong with the, you know,"
"00;09;05;25","00;09;08;06","going for maximal generality"
"00;09;08;06","00;09;10;05","in an approach that might call better,"
"00;09;10;05","00;09;10;19","you know,"
"00;09;10;19","00;09;13;14","or at least allegedly from says up"
"00;09;13;14","00;09;15;04","to, you know, cultural phenomena."
"00;09;17;00","00;09;18;22","And that's our paper in a nutshell."
"00;09;18;22","00;09;20;23","That is how these tradeoffs"
"00;09;20;23","00;09;23;02","might depend on a choice of"
"00;09;24;03","00;09;27;09","language or formalism to make sense of"
"00;09;28;26","00;09;31;11","allegedly any thing."
"00;09;31;21","00;09;32;06","And again,"
"00;09;32;06","00;09;32;26","the thing"
"00;09;32;26","00;09;36;03","that is one of the key terms, I think,"
"00;09;36;18","00;09;39;08","that Marx and before him"
"00;09;39;18","00;09;41;19","come to the car Freestone"
"00;09;41;19","00;09;42;24","put on the map here."
"00;09;42;24","00;09;44;17","And I think it's a helpful way"
"00;09;44;17","00;09;46;19","also to look at our contribution"
"00;09;46;19","00;09;48;04","again in a nutshell."
"00;09;48;04","00;09;49;14","I think the"
"00;09;50;00","00;09;52;19","framework of the framework there"
"00;09;52;19","00;09;53;06","might be"
"00;09;53;06","00;09;54;06","so that"
"00;09;54;06","00;09;55;20","the most interesting properties"
"00;09;55;20","00;09;57;09","of the kind of thing,"
"00;09;57;09","00;09;59;01","if there are things,"
"00;09;59;02","00;10;02;25","say, organisms happen to be"
"00;10;03;07","00;10;04;03","thanks for that,"
"00;10;04;03","00;10;06;17","but anything to add,"
"00;10;07;00","00;10;07;28","I suggest"
"00;10;07;28","00;10;10;25","just to, to repeat what"
"00;10;10;25","00;10;11;27","what Matteo said."
"00;10;11;27","00;10;13;16","So my interest in the free energy"
"00;10;13;16","00;10;15;01","principle came from my interest"
"00;10;15;01","00;10;15;23","in the application"
"00;10;15;23","00;10;16;27","of statistical mechanics"
"00;10;16;27","00;10;17;25","to other disciplines."
"00;10;17;25","00;10;19;23","So that's why we start discussing this"
"00;10;19;23","00;10;20;00","and that's"
"00;10;20;00","00;10;20;25","when I could"
"00;10;20;25","00;10;22;04","so excited about this,"
"00;10;22;04","00;10;23;21","about this research."
"00;10;23;21","00;10;26;00","And I agree with the summary of the"
"00;10;26;00","00;10;27;22","paper that I just listed."
"00;10;29;13","00;10;31;02","This thread of"
"00;10;31;02","00;10;33;26","grounding in fundamental physics ideas"
"00;10;33;26","00;10;35;07","and then trade offs"
"00;10;35;07","00;10;37;25","or opportunities and challenges really"
"00;10;38;13","00;10;39;22","became clear"
"00;10;39;22","00;10;43;10","so maybe one general opening question"
"00;10;44;01","00;10;46;19","What does it mean for a non"
"00;10;46;19","00;10;48;16","statistical physics idea"
"00;10;48;16","00;10;51;00","to be grounded in statistical physics?"
"00;10;51;05","00;10;52;20","Like we're intrinsically talking"
"00;10;52;20","00;10;53;18","about some"
"00;10;53;18","00;10;55;23","interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary"
"00;10;55;23","00;10;57;15","or applied scenario."
"00;10;57;15","00;10;57;29","So we're"
"00;10;57;29","00;10;59;15","leaving that thing"
"00;10;59;15","00;11;02;03","that field of statistical physics."
"00;11;02;03","00;11;03;04","What baggage,"
"00;11;03;04","00;11;05;05","good and bad, do we take with us?"
"00;11;05;05","00;11;06;29","And then is it an advantage?"
"00;11;06;29","00;11;07;20","Is it a weakness?"
"00;11;07;20","00;11;09;05","What does it actually mean for a"
"00;11;09;05","00;11;10;12","non physics area"
"00;11;10;12","00;11;13;01","to be grounded in physics?"
"00;11;13;25","00;11;15;04","Yeah, thank you for that question,"
"00;11;15;04","00;11;15;13","Stephen."
"00;11;15;13","00;11;16;13","That's one of the questions"
"00;11;16;13","00;11;18;06","I have motivated my research"
"00;11;18;06","00;11;19;26","in the last years."
"00;11;20;00","00;11;21;14","I don't think there is"
"00;11;21;14","00;11;22;27","a unique answer to that."
"00;11;22;27","00;11;24;05","So the more I do research"
"00;11;24;05","00;11;25;06","on the applications"
"00;11;25;06","00;11;26;07","of statistical mechanics"
"00;11;26;07","00;11;27;02","to other disciplines,"
"00;11;27;02","00;11;29;08","the more I understand that it varies."
"00;11;29;08","00;11;31;14","So it depends on how it is used,"
"00;11;31;16","00;11;34;00","how host the decision mechanics is used"
"00;11;34;00","00;11;35;26","and depends also on the case"
"00;11;35;26","00;11;37;02","studies and disciplines"
"00;11;37;02","00;11;38;06","in the specific model."
"00;11;38;06","00;11;39;02","So I think that's"
"00;11;39;02","00;11;39;24","why it's worth"
"00;11;39;24","00;11;40;22","to look at"
"00;11;40;22","00;11;42;04","specific case studies"
"00;11;42;04","00;11;44;28","to specific applications of of"
"00;11;44;28","00;11;47;21","statistical mechanics to do disciplines"
"00;11;48;03","00;11;48;15","in order"
"00;11;48;15","00;11;49;28","to answer that question"
"00;11;49;28","00;11;52;12","on a case by case basis."
"00;11;52;12","00;11;53;25","I think in some cases"
"00;11;53;25","00;11;55;06","the application of statistical"
"00;11;55;06","00;11;57;07","mechanics is well justified,"
"00;11;57;09","00;11;58;28","especially when the idea of stations"
"00;11;58;28","00;12;00;11","are well justified."
"00;12;00;11","00;12;03;12","In some other cases, as I would say,"
"00;12;03;12","00;12;05;15","I tend to think that it's the case"
"00;12;05;15","00;12;07;05","of the free energy principle."
"00;12;07;05","00;12;08;25","The application of the basic idea"
"00;12;08;25","00;12;10;28","is to lack justification. So"
"00;12;12;01","00;12;12;10","we are"
"00;12;12;10","00;12;13;07","not saying"
"00;12;13;07","00;12;15;01","or we are not concluding in the paper"
"00;12;15;01","00;12;16;07","that that cannot be know"
"00;12;16;07","00;12;18;09","that it doesn't make sense to"
"00;12;18;09","00;12;20;01","propose a principle"
"00;12;20;01","00;12;21;16","that is based on statistical mechanics,"
"00;12;21;16","00;12;22;13","but we just think that"
"00;12;22;13","00;12;24;16","there's much more work to be done"
"00;12;24;16","00;12;25;23","in the justification"
"00;12;25;23","00;12;27;12","of especially of the organizations"
"00;12;27;12","00;12;28;02","that are involved."
"00;12;28;02","00;12;30;10","When we use statistical mechanics"
"00;12;30;10","00;12;31;26","to formulate a principle"
"00;12;31;26","00;12;34;13","like the free energy principle"
"00;12;35;28","00;12;37;12","classic philosophy,"
"00;12;37;12","00;12;39;06","where do we air"
"00;12;39;06","00;12;42;13","or miss when we idealize, make ideas"
"00;12;42;13","00;12;45;07","of or generalize specific"
"00;12;46;15","00;12;50;02","systems or things?"
"00;12;50;04","00;12;51;26","And what is the thing"
"00;12;51;26","00;12;56;00","concept or the system concept in either"
"00;12;56;06","00;12;57;09","Patricia or Matteo"
"00;12;57;09","00;12;58;27","in either of your areas,"
"00;12;58;27","00;13;00;18","like if you mentioned a thing"
"00;13;00;18","00;13;03;05","or a system, what would that mean in"
"00;13;03;23","00;13;05;03","to the disciplines"
"00;13;05;03","00;13;06;12","that you're working with?"
"00;13;06;12","00;13;06;23","And then"
"00;13;06;23","00;13;07;09","how is it"
"00;13;07;09","00;13;08;02","being used"
"00;13;08;02","00;13;10;26","differently in FSP and active?"
"00;13;10;26","00;13;11;19","And then I see Steve"
"00;13;15;09","00;13;18;03","Martel, you want to answer this?"
"00;13;18;03","00;13;19;11","Sure."
"00;13;21;01","00;13;22;05","I mean, in a sense"
"00;13;22;05","00;13;24;21","your question is about metaphysics"
"00;13;24;21","00;13;26;07","and the question is"
"00;13;26;07","00;13;28;14","what's the thing and what?"
"00;13;29;18","00;13;32;09","And in what way we can make sense"
"00;13;32;09","00;13;35;09","of that thing with"
"00;13;35;09","00;13;37;11","a formalism like the format is a"
"00;13;38;00","00;13;40;01","map of blankets, for instance,"
"00;13;40;01","00;13;42;01","or the formalism of"

"00;13;45;00","00;13;46;13","mechanics"
"00;13;47;16","00;13;49;22","just to turn the points like they"
"00;13;49;25","00;13;51;05","different direction."
"00;13;51;05","00;13;52;20","If I may,"
"00;13;53;26","00;13;57;02","I suppose the question about with that"
"00;13;57;03","00;13;58;21","and the role of idealization,"
"00;13;58;21","00;13;59;28","some which you know, Patricia"
"00;13;59;28","00;14;03;02","just commented on"
"00;14;03;02","00;14;05;01","is not just boiling down to the,"
"00;14;05;01","00;14;05;28","to the"
"00;14;05;28","00;14;07;24","conclusion that that's difficult"
"00;14;07;24","00;14;09;12","with the let's move on"
"00;14;09;12","00;14;12;28","to apply these tools"
"00;14;12;28","00;14;15;17","to a certain system."
"00;14;15;17","00;14;18;07","The challenge we put on the table here"
"00;14;18;07","00;14;21;15","is concerning the generality of"
"00;14;23;05","00;14;25;08","the general idea of the active inference"
"00;14;25;08","00;14;26;25","approach."
"00;14;26;26","00;14;29;07","You know, there is an excellent work"
"00;14;30;07","00;14;33;18","by Philip Strontium Baca and others."
"00;14;33;18","00;14;35;19","So using active inference models"
"00;14;36;18","00;14;39;20","in markers decision processes"
"00;14;39;20","00;14;41;01","with humans,"
"00;14;41;01","00;14;42;21","feeding decisions"

"00;14;46;14","00;14;48;18","with the active inference models,"

"00;14;49;11","00;14;51;08","this is just one example"
"00;14;51;08","00;14;52;17","of a productive"
"00;14;52;17","00;14;55;28","use of the active inference approach"
"00;14;57;29","00;14;59;23","which, you know, resonates"
"00;14;59;23","00;15;01;22","with regular approaches"
"00;15;01;22","00;15;03;21","like Bayesian modeling or reinforcement"
"00;15;03;21","00;15;05;01","learning modeling"
"00;15;05;01","00;15;08;14","what the we're taking issue with is."
"00;15;08;28","00;15;09;14","Look, you're"
"00;15;09;14","00;15;13;04","making claims about a maximal scope,"
"00;15;14;04","00;15;15;08","OK, maximal scope"
"00;15;15;08","00;15;18;11","kind of application of these approach"
"00;15;19;00","00;15;22;28","and to sensibly apply know modest"
"00;15;23;27","00;15;27;07","at any scale, at any scale."
"00;15;27;10","00;15;29;12","Even outside of the life sciences,"
"00;15;29;13","00;15;32;00","you know, having to do with economies"
"00;15;32;00","00;15;34;10","or things with certain assumptions"
"00;15;34;10","00;15;36;17","must be in place in these assumptions."
"00;15;36;17","00;15;36;24","You know,"
"00;15;36;24","00;15;39;19","we provide a number of examples"
"00;15;39;27","00;15;42;19","which all involve the availability"
"00;15;42;19","00;15;46;16","of large data sets that can constrain"
"00;15;47;15","00;15;49;18","say, the application of the model"
"00;15;49;24","00;15;51;13","and also background knowledge"
"00;15;51;13","00;15;53;25","about the target."
"00;15;53;25","00;15;54;26","The target system"
"00;15;54;26","00;15;57;02","are the thing you want understand."
"00;15;57;16","00;15;59;08","And especially, you know,"
"00;15;59;08","00;16;01;06","bridge is a conceptual bridges"
"00;16;01;06","00;16;04;20","between parameters within your model"
"00;16;05;01","00;16;06;13","and features"
"00;16;06;13","00;16;07;25","of the actual systems"
"00;16;07;25","00;16;10;04","that you want to represent."
"00;16;10;12","00;16;11;19","So these are the three,"
"00;16;11;19","00;16;14;01","I think, challenges that"
"00;16;15;01","00;16;17;03","we put on the map for again,"
"00;16;17;03","00;16;21;11","the large scope or very general scope"
"00;16;21;24","00;16;23;27","of some understanding"
"00;16;24;03","00;16;25;24","of active inference"
"00;16;25;24","00;16;27;01","or the free energy principle."
"00;16;27;01","00;16;28;12","So this is a bit of a topic."
"00;16;28;12","00;16;29;13","So I didn't"
"00;16;29;13","00;16;31;06","really answer your question about being,"
"00;16;31;06","00;16;32;21","but at least these are"
"00;16;32;21","00;16;36;06","motivations we had to buy this paper"
"00;16;36;06","00;16;39;28","as in making claims about maximal scope"
"00;16;40;07","00;16;41;18","come with"
"00;16;41;18","00;16;43;07","commitments and these commitments,"
"00;16;43;07","00;16;45;22","at least in the case of many"
"00;16;45;22","00;16;49;06","or most biological systems, do not look"
"00;16;49;22","00;16;51;12","satisfied or plausible"
"00;16;53;14","00;16;54;01","thank you."
"00;16;54;01","00;16;56;13","In a way it does"
"00;16;56;13","00;16;58;12","maybe a little bit better,"
"00;16;58;12","00;17;00;18","but in a way it does"
"00;17;00;18","00;17;01;14","address this question"
"00;17;01;14","00;17;02;15","about our models"
"00;17;02;15","00;17;03;05","as things"
"00;17;03;05","00;17;04;02","and their relationship"
"00;17;04;02","00;17;05;21","to other things,"
"00;17;05;21","00;17;07;05","perhaps the target of modeling."
"00;17;07;05","00;17;08;01","So, Patricia,"
"00;17;08;01","00;17;09;25","if you want to add anything,"
"00;17;09;25","00;17;12;23","otherwise we can go to Steven"
"00;17;13;19","00;17;14;25","just to stress"
"00;17;14;25","00;17;16;06","some of the things that Matteo said,"
"00;17;16;06","00;17;18;22","because I hear the session offline."
"00;17;18;22","00;17;22;16","I hear the session of last week and I"
"00;17;22;21","00;17;25;21","I saw that Maxwell was"
"00;17;27;09","00;17;29;11","concerned or pointing out that we"
"00;17;30;29","00;17;32;18","didn't take the cases"
"00;17;32;18","00;17;34;22","that the applications of the free energy"
"00;17;34;22","00;17;36;29","and principle to some systems"
"00;17;36;29","00;17;38;24","in biology seriously."
"00;17;38;24","00;17;42;02","And but the thing is that our claim"
"00;17;42;02","00;17;42;19","that we did"
"00;17;42;19","00;17;43;18","take them seriously"
"00;17;43;18","00;17;46;21","and we mentioned them in the paper,"
"00;17;46;21","00;17;48;25","but that doesn't contradict"
"00;17;48;25","00;17;50;07","our own claim"
"00;17;50;07","00;17;51;27","because our claim wasn't that"
"00;17;53;02","00;17;53;25","the"
"00;17;54;20","00;17;56;02","statistical mechanics cannot"
"00;17;56;02","00;17;57;29","or the language of dynamical systems"
"00;17;57;29","00;17;58;26","cannot be used"
"00;17;58;26","00;18;01;16","to model biological systems."
"00;18;01;16","00;18;03;26","Our claim was about the generality"
"00;18;03;27","00;18;05;09","of this of this principle."
"00;18;05;09","00;18;08;00","So basically we were concerned"
"00;18;08;10","00;18;09;11","or where we got"
"00;18;09;11","00;18;10;19","we were casting doubt"
"00;18;10;19","00;18;12;11","on the possibility of formulating"
"00;18;12;11","00;18;13;18","a general principle"
"00;18;13;18","00;18;14;25","like the free energy principle."
"00;18;14;25","00;18;18;18","That presupposes that all relevant"
"00;18;18;23","00;18;19;27","biological systems"
"00;18;19;27","00;18;22;14","can be model as random dynamic systems"
"00;18;23;00","00;18;24;24","so just to emphasize that our claim"
"00;18;24;24","00;18;26;16","was our concerns"
"00;18;26;16","00;18;28;14","with the free energy based"
"00;18;28;17","00;18;29;29","generality of this principle"
"00;18;29;29","00;18;32;18","and not with the possibility of modeling"
"00;18;33;11","00;18;34;21","some biological systems"
"00;18;34;21","00;18;35;09","in that way"
"00;18;35;09","00;18;36;21","using the language of random"
"00;18;36;21","00;18;38;13","dynamical system."
"00;18;38;22","00;18;39;12","Thank you."
"00;18;39;12","00;18;40;20","So, Steven,"
"00;18;40;20","00;18;42;13","and then anyone in the live chat"
"00;18;42;13","00;18;45;01","or anyone with a raised hand here."
"00;18;45;03","00;18;46;14","Yeah, thanks. This is very interesting."
"00;18;46;14","00;18;47;26","Hopefully you can hear me OK. Yes."
"00;18;49;19","00;18;52;05","I'm curious and I know that in the"
"00;18;52;21","00;18;54;03","the reference you make to"
"00;18;54;03","00;18;58;02","the paper, this is life as we know it."
"00;18;58;02","00;19;00;21","So there is that question about"
"00;19;02;05","00;19;03;14","suggesting that life"
"00;19;03;14","00;19;05;24","or biological self-organization"
"00;19;05;24","00;19;06;24","is an inevitable,"
"00;19;06;24","00;19;08;28","an emergent property of any"
"00;19;08;28","00;19;10;16","random dynamical system"
"00;19;10;16","00;19;12;18","that possesses a Markov blanket."
"00;19;13;10","00;19;17;04","And I know that in some way I sense that"
"00;19;17;04","00;19;20;06","what they've done to try and"
"00;19;20;07","00;19;22;06","deflate that claim"
"00;19;22;06","00;19;23;04","in 20, 30"
"00;19;23;04","00;19;23;27","is maybe to go down"
"00;19;23;27","00;19;25;22","the mathematical route."
"00;19;25;22","00;19;26;17","I mean,"
"00;19;26;17","00;19;29;10","I sense that you're saying they need to"
"00;19;29;10","00;19;31;21","maybe also go down the physics route"
"00;19;31;21","00;19;34;02","would that would that be something"
"00;19;34;25","00;19;37;03","that you would say like in terms of"
"00;19;38;04","00;19;39;23","how that"
"00;19;41;02","00;19;43;03","that statement,"
"00;19;43;03","00;19;44;22","which has to some extent"
"00;19;44;22","00;19;47;01","been couched over the last few years,"
"00;19;48;13","00;19;49;14","are you saying that these"
"00;19;50;17","00;19;53;11","the physics aspects"
"00;19;53;11","00;19;55;05","haven't been addressed as much"
"00;19;55;05","00;19;57;07","as the statistical aspects"
"00;20;02;19","00;20;04;07","I can see a couple of things in that."
"00;20;04;07","00;20;06;10","I leave it to you, Patricia."
"00;20;06;10","00;20;07;03","Yes."
"00;20;07;03","00;20;08;16","Very quickly,"
"00;20;10;25","00;20;14;23","so one line"
"00;20;15;26","00;20;18;06","of criticism about our paper"
"00;20;18;06","00;20;21;15","is that, you know,"
"00;20;21;26","00;20;24;02","the active inference approach"
"00;20;24;02","00;20;25;15","has been evolving over time."
"00;20;25;15","00;20;27;00","And so we are making claims"
"00;20;27;00","00;20;28;20","about their bodies at the end,"
"00;20;28;20","00;20;30;16","which are just that obsolete"
"00;20;30;16","00;20;32;05","now because,"
"00;20;32;05","00;20;35;04","you know, from that cost detail paper,"
"00;20;35;23","00;20;38;08","that assumption seems to be dropped"
"00;20;39;09","00;20;39;28","and replaced"
"00;20;39;28","00;20;42;12","with the assumption of rationality."
"00;20;43;07","00;20;44;16","But then the question actually"
"00;20;44;16","00;20;45;05","two questions."
"00;20;45;05","00;20;46;10","One question is"
"00;20;46;10","00;20;48;22","why should we believe that any"
"00;20;49;24","00;20;51;12","life size phenomenon,"
"00;20;51;12","00;20;54;26","any organism is stationary, is"
"00;20;55;04","00;20;55;22","what is it?"
"00;20;55;22","00;20;57;03","What is the justification"
"00;20;57;03","00;20;58;23","for that assumption?"
"00;20;58;23","00;20;59;25","And the second"
"00;21;00;15","00;21;01;28","observation would be,"
"00;21;01;28","00;21;03;11","before I leave it to Patricia,"
"00;21;03;11","00;21;05;17","is that even within the paper,"
"00;21;05;21","00;21;07;18","you know, across the entire paper, which"
"00;21;07;18","00;21;08;14","is, you know,"
"00;21;10;15","00;21;12;16","theoretically better reached,"
"00;21;13;13","00;21;15;28","they really made a contribution"
"00;21;15;28","00;21;19;00","to biology in terms of a metaphor"
"00;21;19;00","00;21;20;17","explicitly early on,"
"00;21;20;17","00;21;21;11","they're saying, look,"
"00;21;21;11","00;21;22;25","what we are seeing here"
"00;21;22;25","00;21;26;13","is just a metaphorical representation."
"00;21;27;11","00;21;28;14","And so in a sense,"
"00;21;28;14","00;21;31;08","that's what we are been arguing for."
"00;21;31;17","00;21;33;21","It is true that you can gain"
"00;21;34;02","00;21;35;22","these maximal generality,"
"00;21;35;22","00;21;39;04","but at the cost of making assumptions,"
"00;21;39;16","00;21;40;15","either good condition"
"00;21;40;15","00;21;42;14","or such clarity now"
"00;21;42;14","00;21;44;18","which might might not apply"
"00;21;44;18","00;21;46;28","to biological systems"
"00;21;48;11","00;21;50;03","thank you, Patricia."
"00;21;52;11","00;21;52;23","Yeah."
"00;21;52;23","00;21;56;23","So to to answer Stephen's concern,"
"00;21;56;23","00;21;57;16","I would say yes."
"00;21;57;16","00;21;58;08","So one of the things"
"00;21;58;08","00;21;59;25","that we wanted to point out"
"00;21;59;25","00;22;00;19","is that"
"00;22;00;23","00;22;02;09","we need to focus on the"
"00;22;02;09","00;22;04;00","on the physical foundations"
"00;22;04;00","00;22;04;21","of the free energy"
"00;22;04;21","00;22;06;22","principle, a little bit more than only"
"00;22;06;22","00;22;08;03","the statistical foundations"
"00;22;08;03","00;22;09;06","of the free energy principles"
"00;22;09;06","00;22;10;09","where we believe"
"00;22;10;09","00;22;11;05","we don't claim to be"
"00;22;11;05","00;22;13;24","the only ones that focus on that."
"00;22;13;24","00;22;14;29","But we believe that there is"
"00;22;14;29","00;22;16;28","lack of literature in that sense,"
"00;22;16;28","00;22;18;28","and we want it to contribute to"
"00;22;19;14","00;22;20;21","to to that"
"00;22;20;21","00;22;22;08","to fill that gap, what do we call"
"00;22;23;20","00;22;24;12","it?"
"00;22;24;12","00;22;26;22","So that's that's the short answer."
"00;22;26;22","00;22;27;16","And then"
"00;22;27;23","00;22;28;20","about, again,"
"00;22;28;20","00;22;29;08","the discussion"
"00;22;29;08","00;22;31;26","that you had last last week,"
"00;22;31;26","00;22;33;20","you saw Maxwell,"
"00;22;33;20","00;22;35;06","I think as well, was complaining"
"00;22;35;06","00;22;36;09","that we focus"
"00;22;36;09","00;22;37;23","too much on the older"
"00;22;37;23","00;22;38;14","formulations"
"00;22;38;14","00;22;39;25","of the free energy principles"
"00;22;39;25","00;22;41;18","that of the new relations."
"00;22;41;18","00;22;42;20","And he basically said"
"00;22;42;20","00;22;44;18","that it really doesn't play any role."
"00;22;44;18","00;22;45;27","It's not even mentioned"
"00;22;45;27","00;22;46;27","in the new formulation"
"00;22;46;27","00;22;48;22","of the free energy principle."
"00;22;48;22","00;22;51;13","I don't have a biological background"
"00;22;51;13","00;22;52;20","or a background in neuroscience,"
"00;22;52;20","00;22;54;09","and I haven't work for a long time"
"00;22;54;09","00;22;55;10","in the free energy principle."
"00;22;55;10","00;22;57;13","But I do have a background in physics"
"00;22;57;13","00;22;59;24","and I am a little bit parcel"
"00;22;59;25","00;23;01;13","with the idea that this issue"
"00;23;01;13","00;23;02;25","doesn't play any role"
"00;23;02;25","00;23;03;24","in the new formulation"
"00;23;03;24","00;23;04;13","of the free energy"
"00;23;04;13","00;23;04;28","principle,"
"00;23;04;28","00;23;07;08","especially because they explicitly"
"00;23;07;08","00;23;09;16","allude to the existence"
"00;23;09;16","00;23;10;19","of weakly mixing"
"00;23;10;19","00;23;12;13","random dynamical systems"
"00;23;12;13","00;23;13;17","into my knowledge,"
"00;23;13;17","00;23;15;11","mixing systems required."
"00;23;15;11","00;23;16;17","This is so implied,"
"00;23;17;19","00;23;17;28","so I'm"
"00;23;17;28","00;23;19;01","really not sure and I"
"00;23;19;01","00;23;21;00","haven't seen explicitly."
"00;23;21;00","00;23;22;02","How can you drop"
"00;23;22;02","00;23;22;29","the assumption of people"
"00;23;22;29","00;23;24;14","receiving the free energy? Please."
"00;23;24;14","00;23;25;05","But so"
"00;23;25;20","00;23;28;15","I think that if they if some authors"
"00;23;28;15","00;23;29;13","working on the free energy"
"00;23;29;13","00;23;30;25","principle could clarify to"
"00;23;30;25","00;23;32;00","what extent or why"
"00;23;32;00","00;23;33;12","you don't need this anymore,"
"00;23;33;12","00;23;34;13","I think that would be helpful."
"00;23;34;13","00;23;35;27","So we would be grateful for that."
"00;23;35;27","00;23;38;19","We wouldn't consider that as a failure."
"00;23;38;19","00;23;39;16","In our project."
"00;23;39;16","00;23;41;11","So we would consider it as a success"
"00;23;41;11","00;23;43;20","if our paper leads to more clarity"
"00;23;43;20","00;23;44;23","in the free energy attitude,"
"00;23;44;23","00;23;47;18","that would be a successful paper for us."
"00;23;48;02","00;23;51;10","And and I think the fact that Bill Dahl,"
"00;23;51;14","00;23;52;19","also some paper"
"00;23;52;19","00;23;54;09","that was quoted in this discussion"
"00;23;54;09","00;23;54;28","last week,"
"00;23;54;28","00;23;56;26","also alludes to the older"
"00;23;56;26","00;23;58;05","formulations of the free energy"
"00;23;58;05","00;23;59;24","principle just shows"
"00;23;59;24","00;24;00;26","maybe a confusion"
"00;24;00;26","00;24;02;09","in the literature between older"
"00;24;02;09","00;24;04;01","formulations and new formulations."
"00;24;04;01","00;24;05;16","So I think, again,"
"00;24;05;16","00;24;06;23","it would be very helpful"
"00;24;06;23","00;24;08;10","for people interested on these,"
"00;24;08;10","00;24;09;11","at least to"
"00;24;09;11","00;24;10;18","to have more clarity"
"00;24;10;18","00;24;12;12","about what has changed"
"00;24;12;12","00;24;13;08","in this new framework,"
"00;24;13;08","00;24;14;09","in these new formulations"
"00;24;14;09","00;24;16;04","of the free energy principle,"
"00;24;16;04","00;24;18;26","and to have a more consistent framework"
"00;24;19;00","00;24;20;04","that one can work with."
"00;24;20;04","00;24;21;21","Because we were interested in working"
"00;24;21;21","00;24;22;25","with the legitimate framework."
"00;24;22;25","00;24;23;19","We went"
"00;24;23;19","00;24;25;12","against the free energy principle"
"00;24;25;12","00;24;27;02","and then tried to look for the weak"
"00;24;27;02","00;24;28;24","for the weakest argument to attack them."
"00;24;28;24","00;24;30;27","So there was never no strategy."
"00;24;30;27","00;24;32;28","I don't have anything."
"00;24;32;28","00;24;35;17","I am not married against"
"00;24;35;17","00;24;36;21","the free energy principle."
"00;24;36;21","00;24;37;14","I don't know anything"
"00;24;37;14","00;24;39;10","a priori against this though."
"00;24;39;10","00;24;40;29","So the same with Matthew."
"00;24;40;29","00;24;43;11","So we are just generally interested in"
"00;24;43;11","00;24;44;10","in this application"
"00;24;44;10","00;24;45;01","because it can be"
"00;24;45;01","00;24;46;22","actually potentially useful"
"00;24;46;22","00;24;48;09","or because it has been"
"00;24;48;09","00;24;51;03","so it has caused so much attention"
"00;24;51;03","00;24;52;06","in the in biology."
"00;24;52;06","00;24;53;12","So that's where we are interested"
"00;24;53;12","00;24;54;10","on these in the first place,"
"00;24;54;10","00;24;54;29","not with the idea"
"00;24;54;29","00;24;56;19","of attacking the free energy principle."
"00;24;56;19","00;24;57;25","So again,"
"00;24;57;25","00;24;58;25","if we could have"
"00;24;58;25","00;25;01;10","a better understanding of, of why"
"00;25;01;20","00;25;03;19","the new formulations stand required,"
"00;25;03;19","00;25;04;21","what this is about,"
"00;25;04;21","00;25;06;15","what are the key assumptions"
"00;25;06;15","00;25;07;19","in the new formulations"
"00;25;07;19","00;25;09;04","of the free energy principle?"
"00;25;09;04","00;25;11;13","I think that would save us time."
"00;25;11;13","00;25;13;22","We would be happy to look at that."
"00;25;13;22","00;25;16;03","So I think again,"
"00;25;16;28","00;25;18;29","I agree that we focused mostly"
"00;25;18;29","00;25;20;03","on the alterations"
"00;25;20;03","00;25;20;22","of the free energy"
"00;25;20;22","00;25;22;19","principle, but I think it was"
"00;25;22;19","00;25;24;24","partially because papers were clear"
"00;25;24;24","00;25;25;14","and not because"
"00;25;25;14","00;25;28;04","we wanted to attack the weaker papers"
"00;25;28;04","00;25;29;02","in the same light."
"00;25;29;02","00;25;30;25","The fact that they appeal again"
"00;25;30;25","00;25;33;19","to the existence of weakly mixing random"
"00;25;33;21","00;25;34;19","dynamical systems"
"00;25;34;19","00;25;35;21","suggests for me"
"00;25;35;21","00;25;36;25","that they still are using"
"00;25;36;25","00;25;38;08","and revisiting."
"00;25;38;08","00;25;39;18","And apart from that,"
"00;25;39;18","00;25;41;04","this was not the only argument"
"00;25;41;04","00;25;42;19","that we were presenting in the papers."
"00;25;42;19","00;25;44;04","So we also mentioned faith"
"00;25;44;04","00;25;46;03","basis in Attractors"
"00;25;46;03","00;25;47;06","and the new formulation"
"00;25;47;06","00;25;48;27","still requires face basis"
"00;25;48;27","00;25;51;00","because they need some proof really."
"00;25;51;00","00;25;54;06","And they, they also consider or model"
"00;25;54;07","00;25;55;04","almost statics"
"00;25;55;04","00;25;56;10","are non equilibrium"
"00;25;56;10","00;25;58;26","steady states us in terms of attractors."
"00;25;59;10","00;26;02;01","And that again falls"
"00;26;02;01","00;26;03;11","into our criticism"
"00;26;03;11","00;26;04;19","because we were pointing out"
"00;26;04;19","00;26;05;27","independently of therefore"
"00;26;05;27","00;26;07;08","this is the assumption"
"00;26;07;08","00;26;09;07","we were pointing out that it's very hard"
"00;26;09;07","00;26;09;23","to model"
"00;26;09;23","00;26;11;04","in most systems,"
"00;26;11;04","00;26;12;04","biological system,"
"00;26;12;04","00;26;13;21","even physical systems, perhaps"
"00;26;14;27","00;26;16;05","stationary, non equilibrium,"
"00;26;16;05","00;26;18;10","stationary states in terms of attractors"
"00;26;18;10","00;26;20;08","because attractors imply"
"00;26;20;08","00;26;22;01","some asymptotic results"
"00;26;22;01","00;26;23;02","and it's not easy"
"00;26;23;02","00;26;25;13","to get these asymptotic results."
"00;26;25;13","00;26;28;08","And so basically that was our criticism."
"00;26;28;08","00;26;29;22","So we were by no means"
"00;26;29;22","00;26;31;27","only focusing on obesity,"
"00;26;31;27","00;26;33;12","even if it doesn't play"
"00;26;33;12","00;26;35;00","any role in body formulation"
"00;26;35;00","00;26;36;09","in new formulations,"
"00;26;36;09","00;26;38;24","which is not clear to me."
"00;26;38;24","00;26;39;20","But even so,"
"00;26;39;20","00;26;40;13","I would say"
"00;26;40;13","00;26;42;04","the other points still remain"
"00;26;42;04","00;26;44;01","and we would like to"
"00;26;44;01","00;26;46;00","to have a clear answer to that"
"00;26;46;00","00;26;48;13","even even if that means that we have to,"
"00;26;48;25","00;26;49;16","I don't know,"
"00;26;49;16","00;26;52;09","say that we were wrong in the end, but"
"00;26;52;09","00;26;53;02","I can see it."
"00;26;53;02","00;26;54;28","So if our paper leads to more clarity"
"00;26;54;28","00;26;56;04","in the literature, that would be"
"00;26;56;04","00;26;58;03","would be fine, we would pursue success."
"00;26;59;12","00;27;01;27","Thanks for that and welcome Blue."
"00;27;01;27","00;27;03;06","So I'll just give one comment"
"00;27;03;06","00;27;04;25","and then Steven."
"00;27;04;25","00;27;08;02","So absolutely about the evolution"
"00;27;08;02","00;27;08;24","and changes."
"00;27;08;24","00;27;10;16","It's a non stationary"
"00;27;10;16","00;27;11;21","or maybe there's a higher level"
"00;27;11;21","00;27;13;17","of a stationary to the literature,"
"00;27;13;17","00;27;15;26","but it's one reason why Blue and I"
"00;27;15;26","00;27;17;02","and maybe you,"
"00;27;17;02","00;27;18;02","if anyone listening"
"00;27;18;02","00;27;20;07","wants to contribute seriously to this,"
"00;27;20;17","00;27;21;21","are very interested"
"00;27;21;21","00;27;25;14","in tracking the nomenclature"
"00;27;25;14","00;27;27;14","and which letters are used to refer"
"00;27;27;14","00;27;28;28","to internal and external states"
"00;27;28;28","00;27;29;24","in which assumptions"
"00;27;29;24","00;27;31;17","are implicit or explicit."
"00;27;31;17","00;27;33;05","How does that play out"
"00;27;33;05","00;27;34;11","with the evolution"
"00;27;34;11","00;27;36;13","of literature in this area?"
"00;27;36;13","00;27;38;17","So that's like something that will"
"00;27;38;17","00;27;40;18","hopefully we'll be able to point to."
"00;27;41;02","00;27;43;10","Maybe it's going to be version 1.4"
"00;27;43;18","00;27;44;15","in this paper"
"00;27;44;15","00;27;46;10","or you know, version 1.4,"
"00;27;46;10","00;27;47;20","the English Gambit."
"00;27;47;20","00;27;49;21","We can name them like chess openings."
"00;27;50;09","00;27;51;06","OK, Stephen."
"00;27;52;15","00;27;53;29","Yeah, I think you make a good point."
"00;27;53;29","00;27;55;14","I mean, I think also I"
"00;27;55;14","00;27;56;07","I do agree"
"00;27;56;07","00;27;57;22","in that the cost of paper station"
"00;27;57;22","00;27;59;13","parity is really given"
"00;27;59;13","00;28;01;18","as another way in to some sort of"
"00;28;02;29","00;28;04;22","state that gets revisited."
"00;28;04;22","00;28;06;16","It doesn't necessarily"
"00;28;06;16","00;28;07;29","take out a legislative,"
"00;28;07;29","00;28;09;15","maybe adds another potential."
"00;28;09;15","00;28;12;01","So there's this this question"
"00;28;13;15","00;28;15;04","doesn't it can't just be answered"
"00;28;15;04","00;28;16;11","from a math perspective."
"00;28;16;11","00;28;18;18","I think it's is this physics"
"00;28;19;28","00;28;20;26","reality?"
"00;28;20;26","00;28;22;06","And maybe this is where"
"00;28;22;06","00;28;23;00","non equilibrium"
"00;28;23;00","00;28;24;13","chemistry starts to come in,"
"00;28;24;13","00;28;26;25","although it's a new field."
"00;28;26;27","00;28;31;04","And I think that your your points are"
"00;28;32;01","00;28;34;07","are useful in clarifying"
"00;28;34;22","00;28;36;08","some of those questions."
"00;28;36;08","00;28;37;05","I suppose the question"
"00;28;37;05","00;28;38;01","that also comes up,"
"00;28;38;01","00;28;40;11","which is maybe less common in physics,"
"00;28;41;01","00;28;44;13","is how much can approximation science"
"00;28;44;13","00;28;45;08","how much can"
"00;28;46;10","00;28;49;04","an a kind of noisy"
"00;28;50;07","00;28;53;22","version of a city be enough?"
"00;28;54;18","00;28;55;28","And at what point,"
"00;28;55;28","00;28;56;06","you know,"
"00;28;56;06","00;28;58;12","how many beers is it before I fall over?"
"00;28;58;15","00;28;59;10","You know,"
"00;29;00;03","00;29;02;11","at what point does"
"00;29;02;12","00;29;03;26","does the active inferences process"
"00;29;03;26","00;29;04;07","come down?"
"00;29;04;07","00;29;05;07","I don't"
"00;29;05;07","00;29;08;14","actually think that's necessarily been"
"00;29;09;00","00;29;09;29","or in"
"00;29;09;29","00;29;10;13","I don't know,"
"00;29;10;13","00;29;11;10","physics knows quite"
"00;29;11;10","00;29;14;00","how to handle that question."
"00;29;14;13","00;29;14;23","Yes."
"00;29;14;23","00;29;16;17","How stringently do specific"
"00;29;16;17","00;29;18;23","realizations or models"
"00;29;18;23","00;29;19;10","especially if"
"00;29;19;10","00;29;21;22","they're being evaluated on utility,"
"00;29;21;22","00;29;24;04","how stringently must they fulfill"
"00;29;24;14","00;29;25;28","some of the underlying frameworks?"
"00;29;25;28","00;29;27;02","Like we talked about"
"00;29;27;02","00;29;28;08","how the T test"
"00;29;28;08","00;29;30;05","is built around equal variances"
"00;29;30;05","00;29;31;08","unless you're using an"
"00;29;31;08","00;29;33;09","equal variance version."
"00;29;33;09","00;29;34;00","And of course,"
"00;29;34;00","00;29;36;17","those will never be precisely realized."
"00;29;37;00","00;29;38;05","But then"
"00;29;38;05","00;29;41;02","how close to being precisely realized"
"00;29;41;08","00;29;45;07","must or should things be maturing or."
"00;29;45;07","00;29;46;12","Patricia, any thoughts"
"00;29;48;23","00;29;50;09","but otherwise"
"00;29;50;09","00;29;51;07","the comment"
"00;29;51;07","00;29;52;18","that came to mind was Patricia"
"00;29;52;18","00;29;53;24","you mentioned"
"00;29;53;24","00;29;56;23","and it was in your 2018 paper,"
"00;29;56;23","00;29;59;06","I think that we looked at in the zero"
"00;29;59;29","00;30;02;14","about how there's the asymptotic"
"00;30;02;19","00;30;04;01","characteristics"
"00;30;04;01","00;30;05;29","and the convergence time."
"00;30;05;29","00;30;08;25","So that was very interesting, just"
"00;30;10;04","00;30;11;18","that there was a, there is, it's"
"00;30;11;18","00;30;13;22","sort of this attractor,"
"00;30;13;22","00;30;15;14","but there was more to the attractor"
"00;30;15;14","00;30;17;17","than just where it was."
"00;30;18;07","00;30;21;03","So maybe I unpack that."
"00;30;21;03","00;30;23;00","And then how did you see that"
"00;30;23;00","00;30;25;17","grafting into or relating to the"
"00;30;26;14","00;30;28;16","comments on FP and active"
"00;30;30;12","00;30;31;01","yeah."
"00;30;31;05","00;30;32;03","That's another"
"00;30;32;03","00;30;34;03","sorry I have to leave now."
"00;30;34;03","00;30;34;11","Thank you."
"00;30;34;11","00;30;36;04","Matteo, I thought this is,"
"00;30;36;04","00;30;38;05","you know, it's been fun."
"00;30;39;17","00;30;41;00","I very sorry."
"00;30;41;00","00;30;41;16","You know, it"
"00;30;41;16","00;30;42;25","lasted only 30 minutes"
"00;30;42;25","00;30;45;05","because I saw some blue joined"
"00;30;45;13","00;30;46;18","and I had answers"
"00;30;46;18","00;30;48;13","to a couple of their questions"
"00;30;48;13","00;30;49;21","in the interview sessions."
"00;30;49;21","00;30;51;17","About the dynamic equilibrium"
"00;30;51;17","00;30;53;28","and why we're using transport"
"00;30;54;16","00;30;57;11","states as active states."
"00;30;57;28","00;31;00;24","Well we can do 31.3"
"00;31;01;06","00;31;02;17","literally any time"
"00;31;02;17","00;31;03;23","we can do it in a year."
"00;31;03;23","00;31;05;24","So that's why we do decimal notation."
"00;31;05;24","00;31;07;14","Any time it's right."
"00;31;07;14","00;31;08;09","Just let us know"
"00;31;08;09","00;31;09;16","and you're always welcome back"
"00;31;09;16","00;31;10;09","for a gas stream"
"00;31;10;09","00;31;11;22","presenting on current work."
"00;31;11;22","00;31;13;02","So good luck with your teaching"
"00;31;13;02","00;31;14;14","responsibilities in season"
"00;31;15;14","00;31;17;19","two, January, the charge of everybody."
"00;31;17;19","00;31;19;29","And thanks for dropping attention"
"00;31;19;29","00;31;23;07","cheers to Patricia Cloud there."
"00;31;24;06","00;31;25;00","OK,"
"00;31;26;17","00;31;27;08","yeah."
"00;31;27;08","00;31;30;05","So yeah, you were mentioning my 2000."
"00;31;30;06","00;31;32;24","I need to basically do it. Yeah."
"00;31;32;24","00;31;33;15","So that"
"00;31;33;23","00;31;35;29","I think the question of us interjects"
"00;31;35;29","00;31;37;04","is related to a question"
"00;31;37;04","00;31;38;14","of approximation science"
"00;31;38;14","00;31;41;11","and I'm interested in both questions"
"00;31;41;24","00;31;44;02","and this is basically what I have done"
"00;31;44;11","00;31;45;03","independently"
"00;31;45;03","00;31;46;27","of the free energy principle"
"00;31;46;27","00;31;48;07","in my research in the last"
"00;31;48;07","00;31;48;27","in the last year."
"00;31;48;27","00;31;49;16","So basically"
"00;31;49;16","00;31;50;04","what I what"
"00;31;50;04","00;31;51;25","I pointed out about asymptotes"
"00;31;51;25","00;31;53;27","in the paper that you were mentioning"
"00;31;53;27","00;31;55;12","is that"
"00;31;55;21","00;31;58;24","in order to make a model realistic,"
"00;31;59;00","00;32;02;07","a model that takes us into, takes"
"00;32;02;07","00;32;03;09","into account in order"
"00;32;03;09","00;32;05;12","to make that model realistic,"
"00;32;05;12","00;32;07;23","we not only have to pay attention"
"00;32;07;23","00;32;08;23","to the solutions"
"00;32;08;23","00;32;10;06","that you get in the limit"
"00;32;10;06","00;32;11;22","when you take a limit,"
"00;32;11;22","00;32;13;01","you also have to pay attention"
"00;32;13;01","00;32;15;08","to how fast that limit converges"
"00;32;15;24","00;32;17;02","and that"
"00;32;17;05","00;32;18;10","that could be considered"
"00;32;18;10","00;32;19;12","relaxation time"
"00;32;19;12","00;32;22;04","or that time that you take that"
"00;32;22;04","00;32;23;29","that the limits need"
"00;32;23;29","00;32;25;24","in order to to"
"00;32;25;24","00;32;27;01","or that we need in order to"
"00;32;27;01","00;32;27;29","achieve that limit"
"00;32;29;05","00;32;31;15","needs to be realistic too."
"00;32;31;29","00;32;33;10","So you don't want"
"00;32;33;11","00;32;35;08","you don't only have to pay attention"
"00;32;35;08","00;32;35;25","to the values"
"00;32;35;25","00;32;37;08","that you take, that you"
"00;32;37;08","00;32;38;26","that you obtain when you take a limit."
"00;32;38;26","00;32;40;03","You also have to check to"
"00;32;40;03","00;32;42;18","to pay attention to that, to"
"00;32;43;19","00;32;44;15","the rate"
"00;32;44;15","00;32;46;16","in which you approach that limit."
"00;32;48;00","00;32;49;08","So that will also help you"
"00;32;49;08","00;32;51;21","to understand how realistic is the model"
"00;32;51;29","00;32;55;04","that you are that you are using"
"00;32;55;22","00;32;57;07","and how would that tie"
"00;32;57;07","00;33;00;29","to approximation science"
"00;33;02;01","00;33;02;23","it depends."
"00;33;02;23","00;33;05;04","Again, some some models"
"00;33;05;20","00;33;06;08","on the models"
"00;33;06;08","00;33;07;20","that you're analyzing in the science"
"00;33;07;20","00;33;09;04","that you are looking at."
"00;33;09;04","00;33;11;12","So if you are"
"00;33;11;22","00;33;14;04","investigating models that use limits,"
"00;33;14;04","00;33;16;07","then there is a very clear"
"00;33;16;07","00;33;18;27","understanding of approximation because"
"00;33;19;11","00;33;22;24","limits give you sort of a neat"
"00;33;22;24","00;33;25;07","understanding of the approximations"
"00;33;25;07","00;33;26;19","that you are using."
"00;33;26;19","00;33;29;11","But approximations are not always"
"00;33;29;20","00;33;30;20","in the form of limits."
"00;33;30;20","00;33;31;26","Sometimes approximations"
"00;33;31;26","00;33;33;16","can be in the form of similarity"
"00;33;33;16","00;33;35;01","and then saying to"
"00;33;35;01","00;33;35;15","what extent"
"00;33;35;15","00;33;36;19","that model is realistic,"
"00;33;36;19","00;33;39;04","it can be a little bit more obscure."
"00;33;39;04","00;33;41;01","So when you're modeling size limits,"
"00;33;41;01","00;33;42;25","then you might have a clear way"
"00;33;42;25","00;33;44;07","of understanding to what extent"
"00;33;44;07","00;33;45;21","your model is close"
"00;33;45;21","00;33;47;23","to or to that to the target that you"
"00;33;47;23","00;33;48;14","are trying to model"
"00;33;52;13","00;33;54;05","very interesting."
"00;33;54;05","00;33;56;28","So one thought that's"
"00;33;57;08","00;33;59;28","come up in a few different context."
"00;33;59;29","00;34;03;00","Is it's almost like a vital ism, 1.0"
"00;34;03;00","00;34;05;07","and a vital ism 2.0."
"00;34;05;07","00;34;08;16","And the 1.0 was like, you know, is there"
"00;34;08;16","00;34;09;28","the élan vital"
"00;34;09;28","00;34;10;11","is there"
"00;34;10;11","00;34;11;21","something more to it"
"00;34;11;21","00;34;14;17","than chemistry in biology?"
"00;34;14;24","00;34;15;19","And, you know,"
"00;34;15;19","00;34;19;18","the synthesis X vitro or X vehicle"
"00;34;19;18","00;34;21;12","should I say, of vitamin C"
"00;34;21;12","00;34;22;00","for some reasons"
"00;34;22;00","00;34;23;09","point to as an example of like"
"00;34;23;09","00;34;24;00","demonstrating that"
"00;34;24;00","00;34;25;28","biological molecules could arise"
"00;34;25;28","00;34;27;23","through chemical synthesis"
"00;34;27;23","00;34;28;07","and therefore"
"00;34;28;07","00;34;30;18","maybe more than just vitamin C,"
"00;34;30;18","00;34;31;10","but maybe DE"
"00;34;31;10","00;34;33;29","could also be made in the test tube."
"00;34;33;29","00;34;36;16","And now we're in a area"
"00;34;36;16","00;34;37;23","where we're asking,"
"00;34;37;23","00;34;41;24","OK, given the grounding of biology"
"00;34;41;24","00;34;44;13","in physics and chemistry, 1.0,"
"00;34;44;24","00;34;45;13","how do we go"
"00;34;45;13","00;34;48;13","from that sort of equilibrium"
"00;34;49;05","00;34;51;25","into homeostasis in our status"
"00;34;52;08","00;34;55;11","and more advanced forms of predictive,"
"00;34;56;03","00;34;59;11","higher level behavior from systems"
"00;34;59;11","00;35;02;29","that are also composed of less strategic"
"00;35;03;10","00;35;04;26","components? So"
"00;35;06;16","00;35;07;16","there's going to be"
"00;35;07;16","00;35;07;28","just like"
"00;35;07;28","00;35;08;21","there were challenges"
"00;35;08;21","00;35;13;07","us going from the physics of a membrane"
"00;35;13;16","00;35;14;17","into understanding how"
"00;35;14;17","00;35;16;26","biological systems deploy membranes."
"00;35;17;19","00;35;18;18","Now we're moving"
"00;35;18;18","00;35;21;05","upper level into the cybernetic"
"00;35;21;05","00;35;22;28","or into the anticipatory space"
"00;35;22;28","00;35;24;23","and asking how those very same"
"00;35;24;23","00;35;26;07","biological systems"
"00;35;26;07","00;35;27;13","which we've deflated away"
"00;35;27;13","00;35;29;22","to be chemical and physical."
"00;35;29;22","00;35;30;18","Now, will"
"00;35;30;18","00;35;33;00","there be another level of deflation"
"00;35;33;00","00;35;34;03","or is this a bubble"
"00;35;34;03","00;35;36;11","that's a little harder to pop?"
"00;35;36;11","00;35;37;20","So Stephen"
"00;35;37;20","00;35;38;15","and then Patricia"
"00;35;38;15","00;35;40;09","or anyone else with thoughts."
"00;35;41;00","00;35;44;26","Yeah, this is a good point about it"
"00;35;44;27","00;35;47;16","being a bit hard. It's a pop"
"00;35;47;16","00;35;49;08","because there's a lot of the once"
"00;35;49;08","00;35;50;08","you get into the chemistry,"
"00;35;50;08","00;35;52;13","there's a lot of then"
"00;35;52;16","00;35;54;11","there's a lot of hidden states"
"00;35;54;11","00;35;55;18","that's true of that."
"00;35;55;18","00;35;56;24","So there's that assumption"
"00;35;56;24","00;35;57;26","that you pass through often"
"00;35;57;26","00;35;59;13","maybe a transition state"
"00;35;59;13","00;36;01;15","when you go from reactants to products,"
"00;36;01;15","00;36;02;24","but it's going from equilibrium"
"00;36;02;24","00;36;03;16","to equilibrium."
"00;36;03;16","00;36;04;23","Either the transitions state"
"00;36;04;23","00;36;07;08","is looked at in terms of its energy"
"00;36;07;23","00;36;11;01","accessibility, but that's again"
"00;36;11;01","00;36;12;13","the kind of a stable state."
"00;36;12;13","00;36;14;25","So this question about something"
"00;36;14;25","00;36;17;15","circling around non equilibrium"
"00;36;18;04","00;36;19;22","or far from equilibrium,"
"00;36;20;21","00;36;22;25","the mix in states,"
"00;36;22;25","00;36;24;04","which is why I think you can't"
"00;36;24;04","00;36;25;03","I think that you say,"
"00;36;25;03","00;36;25;21","OK, this is"
"00;36;25;21","00;36;27;17","you can't be or something along"
"00;36;27;17","00;36;29;27","those lines can't be ignored."
"00;36;29;27","00;36;31;13","Certainly once you get into anything"
"00;36;31;13","00;36;33;29","which is more in the"
"00;36;33;29","00;36;35;06","liquid"
"00;36;36;09","00;36;38;01","context."
"00;36;38;05","00;36;40;11","So the question comes up then is"
"00;36;40;11","00;36;43;23","when you've got these attractors"
"00;36;43;23","00;36;44;24","or these far"
"00;36;44;24","00;36;46;02","from equilibrium states"
"00;36;46;02","00;36;48;25","which are not necessarily"
"00;36;48;25","00;36;51;03","energetically favored"
"00;36;51;03","00;36;54;06","alone, they may be somehow in tropically"
"00;36;54;06","00;36;56;14","favored or somehow complexity"
"00;36;56;14","00;36;59;19","favored through these attractors anyway."
"00;36;59;21","00;37;01;06","Is that something around"
"00;37;01;06","00;37;03;17","how catalysts work in"
"00;37;03;17","00;37;05;14","and in the more sort of"
"00;37;05;14","00;37;06;11","if you were to go in"
"00;37;06;11","00;37;08;13","a more detailed level of modeling?"
"00;37;09;21","00;37;12;15","So I wonder how"
"00;37;12;15","00;37;14;03","your thoughts are around"
"00;37;14;03","00;37;15;27","the sort of catalysis processes"
"00;37;15;27","00;37;17;07","that might be happening"
"00;37;17;07","00;37;20;09","in biological systems and how,"
"00;37;21;00","00;37;21;21","you know,"
"00;37;21;21","00;37;24;18","how do these far from equilibrium states"
"00;37;25;06","00;37;27;19","facilitate these"
"00;37;28;22","00;37;30;19","these abilities to"
"00;37;30;19","00;37;32;29","minimize for energy"
"00;37;36;02","00;37;37;15","if you have any thoughts"
"00;37;37;15","00;37;39;28","not Patricia otherwise blue to"
"00;37;40;19","00;37;42;07","I would leave that to you"
"00;37;42;07","00;37;42;29","with us to work"
"00;37;42;29","00;37;45;20","more on the free energy principle"
"00;37;46;12","00;37;48;28","I don't know I think the assumption"
"00;37;48;28","00;37;49;19","that I've worked more"
"00;37;49;19","00;37;51;04","on the free energy principle is"
"00;37;51;04","00;37;53;07","maybe kind of I don't know"
"00;37;53;24","00;37;55;13","not not not right."
"00;37;55;13","00;37;56;17","I don't really have an answer."
"00;37;56;17","00;37;59;26","Don't let the cat ears deceive you."
"00;38;00;28","00;38;03;07","Bob, but"
"00;38;03;07","00;38;05;22","cool questions."
"00;38;05;22","00;38;08;17","There's many other avenues we can go."
"00;38;08;17","00;38;09;07","But Patricia,"
"00;38;09;07","00;38;13;02","what is your current research or what"
"00;38;13;02","00;38;13;28","do you see"
"00;38;13;28","00;38;16;04","following your work now that it"
"00;38;16;28","00;38;17;25","came out? Like what?"
"00;38;17;25","00;38;20;05","Where do you go from that state update"
"00;38;20;20","00;38;22;15","to your next questions."
"00;38;22;15","00;38;26;03","If they're related or not, it's all good"
"00;38;26;07","00;38;26;15","yeah."
"00;38;26;15","00;38;27;15","I actually I'm thinking"
"00;38;27;15","00;38;30;08","about applying for a pro ject,"
"00;38;30;08","00;38;31;17","which it doesn't have to do"
"00;38;31;17","00;38;32;23","with free energy principle,"
"00;38;32;23","00;38;34;16","but it does have to do with applications"
"00;38;34;16","00;38;37;09","of statistical mechanics. To biology."
"00;38;37;09","00;38;39;10","So I have been working for a few years."
"00;38;39;10","00;38;40;12","I will partly"
"00;38;40;12","00;38;44;14","I so I just finished a book on emergence"
"00;38;44;14","00;38;45;18","and production in physics"
"00;38;45;18","00;38;48;00","so I have been working on a concept of"
"00;38;48;01","00;38;49;00","emergency introduction"
"00;38;49;00","00;38;50;00","for physical systems,"
"00;38;50;00","00;38;50;29","especially thinking about"
"00;38;50;29","00;38;52;19","critical phenomena."
"00;38;52;19","00;38;54;28","What I want to do now is to see"
"00;38;55;07","00;38;56;14","whether that notion"
"00;38;56;14","00;38;58;01","of emergence and production"
"00;38;58;01","00;38;59;10","that I suggest also works"
"00;38;59;10","00;39;01;02","for biological systems,"
"00;39;01;02","00;39;01;23","but I would"
"00;39;01;23","00;39;03;10","focus on biological systems"
"00;39;03;10","00;39;05;21","that can be model as critical phenomena"
"00;39;05;21","00;39;07;02","which means can be model."
"00;39;07;02","00;39;08;28","You see the physics of face transitions."
"00;39;09;27","00;39;10;23","So this is what I"
"00;39;10;23","00;39;11;24","what I have in mind though,"
"00;39;11;24","00;39;15;09","and I intuitively think somewhere in our"
"00;39;16;00","00;39;18;23","hypothesis is that the same concept"
"00;39;18;23","00;39;20;18","doesn't work for biological systems,"
"00;39;20;18","00;39;23;02","and that one needs to distinguish"
"00;39;23;02","00;39;23;19","between them."
"00;39;23;19","00;39;25;14","But I think it would be useful"
"00;39;25;14","00;39;27;15","to look specifically at systems"
"00;39;27;15","00;39;31;14","that can be modern as critical phenomena"
"00;39;33;00","00;39;34;25","to see that this analogy"
"00;39;34;25","00;39;36;22","maybe between biological systems"
"00;39;36;22","00;39;38;11","and physical systems."
"00;39;38;11","00;39;39;02","So that's"
"00;39;39;02","00;39;40;02","maybe the reason why"
"00;39;40;02","00;39;40;24","I would focus"
"00;39;40;24","00;39;42;02","especially on those systems"
"00;39;42;02","00;39;44;00","that can be according to"
"00;39;44;00","00;39;46;06","to too many faces as we model"
"00;39;46;07","00;39;48;00","and biologically model us"
"00;39;48;00","00;39;49;11","could become phenomena"
"00;39;49;25","00;39;50;25","interesting."
"00;39;50;25","00;39;55;15","In fact, criticality is perhaps again"
"00;39;55;16","00;39;57;17","the language analysis will"
"00;39;57;17","00;39;58;22","reveal in the future,"
"00;39;58;22","00;39;59;24","but it's not a term"
"00;39;59;24","00;40;02;01","that gets brought up in the act"
"00;40;02;01","00;40;05;14","in an area that much it's"
"00;40;05;14","00;40;07;12","more apt to describe assist,"
"00;40;07;12","00;40;10;12","although in, for instance, work"
"00;40;10;12","00;40;12;04","on neural systems,"
"00;40;12;04","00;40;14;09","there actually is a lot of it."
"00;40;14;09","00;40;15;09","And so there's actually"
"00;40;15;09","00;40;16;07","so much"
"00;40;16;07","00;40;17;11","in the SPM"
"00;40;17;11","00;40;19;19","and dynamical modeling literature"
"00;40;19;19","00;40;22;12","that is not made it quite over the hill."
"00;40;22;27","00;40;24;26","But I think that there's"
"00;40;24;26","00;40;25;14","more to be said."
"00;40;25;14","00;40;27;17","We'll look forward to that book. Steven"
"00;40;30;03","00;40;30;21","Yeah,"
"00;40;30;29","00;40;32;17","that's an interesting point"
"00;40;32;17","00;40;34;14","in the making because you are."
"00;40;34;14","00;40;37;14","So is it almost like you think"
"00;40;37;14","00;40;38;20","there's a lot of"
"00;40;41;14","00;40;41;24","a lot"
"00;40;41;24","00;40;44;04","of computational processes"
"00;40;44;04","00;40;45;09","that can happen"
"00;40;45;09","00;40;47;06","purely through phase transitions"
"00;40;47;06","00;40;49;19","and statistical processes?"
"00;40;49;19","00;40;50;17","Which"
"00;40;51;09","00;40;52;01","is not quite"
"00;40;52;01","00;40;53;23","the same as the inference process."
"00;40;53;23","00;40;54;12","But is it"
"00;40;54;12","00;40;55;21","maybe more like the sort of thing"
"00;40;55;21","00;40;58;26","you see when modes"
"00;40;58;26","00;41;00;24","find their way to food"
"00;41;00;24","00;41;02;03","and things like that?"
"00;41;02;03","00;41;02;29","So you sort of saying"
"00;41;02;29","00;41;03;25","there's a kind of a,"
"00;41;03;25","00;41;06;09","a physics explanation."
"00;41;06;09","00;41;07;04","There's some things"
"00;41;07;04","00;41;09;22","which doesn't require"
"00;41;10;29","00;41;13;05","the inference process,"
"00;41;13;05","00;41;13;29","and that could do a"
"00;41;13;29","00;41;15;28","lot of the heavy lifting"
"00;41;18;00","00;41;18;16","yeah."
"00;41;18;16","00;41;22;16","So I am I will focus on, on, on models"
"00;41;22;16","00;41;24;11","that use the mathematics of pace"
"00;41;24;11","00;41;26;02","transitions with variation."
"00;41;26;02","00;41;27;08","So you never use exactly"
"00;41;27;08","00;41;28;05","the same mathematics."
"00;41;28;05","00;41;28;22","You have to"
"00;41;28;22","00;41;30;07","you have to make change"
"00;41;30;07","00;41;31;01","spending on the case"
"00;41;31;01","00;41;32;27","study that you're investigating."
"00;41;32;27","00;41;33;15","But I will,"
"00;41;33;15","00;41;37;07","I will focus on, on models that that use"
"00;41;37;07","00;41;38;04","the mathematics"
"00;41;38;04","00;41;39;06","of phase transitions"
"00;41;39;06","00;41;41;17","to understand biological phenomena"
"00;41;42;08","00;41;45;16","in unexpected would be forking"
"00;41;45;24","00;41;47;05","behavior, for example."
"00;41;47;05","00;41;48;10","So there are plenty of models"
"00;41;48;10","00;41;50;10","that use the ABC model or something"
"00;41;50;10","00;41;52;12","like the ICI model"
"00;41;52;12","00;41;54;04","to understand forking behavior,"
"00;41;54;04","00;41;55;25","which is that behavior of words"
"00;41;55;25","00;41;57;24","that seem to be emerging with respect"
"00;41;57;24","00;41;59;12","to the behavior of individual birds"
"00;42;00;18","00;42;02;09","and in other case studies"
"00;42;02;09","00;42;04;01","like melding protein melding,"
"00;42;04;01","00;42;04;22","that can be a"
"00;42;04;22","00;42;07;27","model of a face transition."
"00;42;08;05","00;42;09;24","I'm going to I'm going to analyze"
"00;42;09;24","00;42;11;22","plenty of case studies of research"
"00;42;11;22","00;42;12;14","that have been done"
"00;42;12;14","00;42;16;08","already in physics and in biology is in"
"00;42;16;08","00;42;18;09","the idea would be to understand"
"00;42;18;09","00;42;19;27","what kind of"
"00;42;20;15","00;42;22;07","notion of emergence"
"00;42;22;07","00;42;24;00","do you find in biological systems?"
"00;42;24;00","00;42;24;22","And the question is"
"00;42;24;22","00;42;25;25","whether that is similar"
"00;42;25;25","00;42;27;01","to the notion of emergence"
"00;42;27;01","00;42;30;11","that appears in in physical systems."
"00;42;31;19","00;42;33;13","And as I said, I intuitively"
"00;42;33;13","00;42;34;25","think that it's not the same."
"00;42;34;25","00;42;35;29","But since I would look at"
"00;42;35;29","00;42;37;03","similar case studies,"
"00;42;37;03","00;42;38;21","I think that can show that difference"
"00;42;38;21","00;42;39;29","between biological systems"
"00;42;39;29","00;42;40;28","and physical systems"
"00;42;40;28","00;42;43;06","quite, quite clearly"
"00;42;43;06","00;42;45;16","call Steven as I lab one thing to that."
"00;42;45;16","00;42;47;03","Yes, of course,"
"00;42;47;03","00;42;47;27","nobody's going to say that."
"00;42;47;27","00;42;48;18","I just want to"
"00;42;48;18","00;42;49;17","there's one thing I was curious"
"00;42;49;17","00;42;51;25","then, is it like because this"
"00;42;51;25","00;42;52;22","there's this interesting"
"00;42;52;22","00;42;53;20","when I'm talking to people"
"00;42;53;20","00;42;54;15","who've got maybe"
"00;42;54;15","00;42;55;22","more of a chemistry"
"00;42;55;22","00;42;57;29","background, emergence is more"
"00;42;58;04","00;43;00;20","the emergence of interactions between"
"00;43;01;11","00;43;03;25","things through molecules and stuff."
"00;43;03;25","00;43;05;00","And then you get these kind of"
"00;43;05;00","00;43;05;24","and then you've got this"
"00;43;05;24","00;43;07;25","more process based"
"00;43;07;25","00;43;10;20","kind of inference, dynamical one."
"00;43;11;01","00;43;14;13","So you sort of seen the way of emergence"
"00;43;14;13","00;43;15;10","being able to do"
"00;43;15;10","00;43;16;00","quite a lot"
"00;43;16;00","00;43;17;10","from the kind of"
"00;43;17;10","00;43;18;25","perspective of"
"00;43;18;25","00;43;21;06","things interacting with each other"
"00;43;21;06","00;43;23;02","based on rules"
"00;43;23;02","00;43;24;28","rather than a nonlinear dynamical"
"00;43;26;12","00;43;27;09","approach."
"00;43;28;15","00;43;30;09","Both actually."
"00;43;30;09","00;43;31;16","So you find both"
"00;43;31;16","00;43;33;05","the interface transitions that way."
"00;43;33;05","00;43;33;18","That's why"
"00;43;33;18","00;43;35;02","phase transitions in physics"
"00;43;35;02","00;43;35;28","have been considered"
"00;43;35;28","00;43;37;04","as the prototype"
"00;43;37;04","00;43;40;06","example of emergent behavior,"
"00;43;40;06","00;43;42;16","because you find nonlinear"
"00;43;42;16","00;43;44;28","until you find"
"00;43;44;28","00;43;48;10","a long range correlations."
"00;43;49;19","00;43;50;15","And well,"
"00;43;50;15","00;43;51;17","the interactions in most"
"00;43;51;17","00;43;52;16","systems are local"
"00;43;52;16","00;43;54;04","but you still have these"
"00;43;54;04","00;43;57;06","long range correlations that require"
"00;43;57;06","00;43;58;26","using some fancy"
"00;43;58;26","00;44;01;02","slightly randomization methods."
"00;44;01;02","00;44;02;10","For example,"
"00;44;02;12","00;44;04;17","so you have some notion of collectivity"
"00;44;04;17","00;44;06;26","there in phase transitions in physics,"
"00;44;07;04","00;44;09;00","not because of long range interactions,"
"00;44;09;00","00;44;10;23","but because of long range correlations."
"00;44;10;23","00;44;12;29","So it appears as if the"
"00;44;12;29","00;44;15;05","interaction between between"
"00;44;15;05","00;44;16;23","distant particles would be"
"00;44;16;23","00;44;17;19","would be long range."
"00;44;17;19","00;44;18;08","It is not,"
"00;44;18;08","00;44;19;13","but it appears like that"
"00;44;19;13","00;44;21;26","because you have long range correlations"
"00;44;21;26","00;44;23;17","so I will look at similar"
"00;44;23;17","00;44;25;00","cases in biology"
"00;44;25;00","00;44;25;28","that have been modeled"
"00;44;25;28","00;44;27;19","already using physics."
"00;44;27;19","00;44;29;10","And then I will try to answer"
"00;44;29;10","00;44;31;06","whether that notion of emergence"
"00;44;31;06","00;44;32;21","in terms of non-linearity"
"00;44;32;21","00;44;35;01","and so on are what I suggest"
"00;44;35;01","00;44;36;00","it's emerges."
"00;44;36;00","00;44;37;04","Emergent behavior"
"00;44;37;04","00;44;37;23","in physics"
"00;44;37;23","00;44;40;00","can also be applied to biology."
"00;44;40;00","00;44;41;00","And I think what"
"00;44;41;00","00;44;42;15","but this is this is preliminary."
"00;44;42;15","00;44;43;05","So this is not"
"00;44;43;05","00;44;44;26","these are not the results of my research"
"00;44;44;26","00;44;46;18","because I will be doing that"
"00;44;46;18","00;44;48;01","for the next years."
"00;44;48;01","00;44;50;03","But preliminary thought"
"00;44;51;09","00;44;52;02","is that"
"00;44;52;29","00;44;53;18","you will see a"
"00;44;53;18","00;44;54;11","different spatially"
"00;44;54;11","00;44;55;18","with top down causation"
"00;44;55;18","00;44;57;07","that may happen in biology."
"00;44;57;07","00;44;58;19","That doesn't happen in physics,"
"00;44;58;19","00;45;00;07","but this is just preliminary."
"00;45;00;07","00;45;02;08","So you would try not to say"
"00;45;02;08","00;45;03;06","too much about this"
"00;45;03;06","00;45;05;11","because I haven't done that."
"00;45;05;11","00;45;06;01","I just have done"
"00;45;06;01","00;45;07;09","the research for the project."
"00;45;07;09","00;45;09;10","But then the"
"00;45;09;26","00;45;12;24","you can you can wait for this result."
"00;45;12;24","00;45;13;17","Thank you."
"00;45;13;21","00;45;14;10","Blue"
"00;45;15;26","00;45;17;29","so that's super interesting."
"00;45;17;29","00;45;18;28","And again,"
"00;45;18;28","00;45;21;08","something that I'm very interested in"
"00;45;21;08","00;45;24;08","is this idea of emergence."
"00;45;24;08","00;45;26;06","And when you're you're studying"
"00;45;26;06","00;45;27;20","these transitions"
"00;45;27;20","00;45;29;23","or criticality in physics,"
"00;45;29;23","00;45;32;17","like, for example, just to from a liquid"
"00;45;32;17","00;45;33;12","to a gas,"
"00;45;33;12","00;45;35;18","you know, it's easy to see on a graph"
"00;45;35;18","00;45;37;00","this kind of inflection"
"00;45;37;00","00;45;38;20","point of temperature"
"00;45;38;20","00;45;41;08","where the phase transition occurs."
"00;45;41;08","00;45;42;17","And I just am wondering"
"00;45;42;17","00;45;44;09","what kind of metrics"
"00;45;44;09","00;45;46;13","you're using to quantify emergence"
"00;45;47;11","00;45;48;29","in your future research in"
"00;45;48;29","00;45;50;00","biological systems"
"00;45;54;19","00;45;55;10","and that"
"00;45;55;10","00;45;57;00","dependance again,"
"00;45;57;00","00;45;58;15","sorry that many, many times."
"00;45;58;15","00;45;59;00","My, my,"
"00;45;59;00","00;46;00;07","my answer is the same,"
"00;46;00;07","00;46;01;27","but that depends on the I'm"
"00;46;01;27","00;46;03;23","not using a specific metric"
"00;46;03;23","00;46;05;04","because I'm not proposing"
"00;46;05;04","00;46;07;02","a general framework."
"00;46;07;02","00;46;08;02","I'm just studying"
"00;46;08;02","00;46;09;27","like different case studies."
"00;46;09;27","00;46;11;07","And depending on the case study,"
"00;46;11;07","00;46;12;18","on the kind of phase transition"
"00;46;12;18","00;46;13;19","that I'm studying is"
"00;46;13;19","00;46;14;26","there is the metric"
"00;46;14;26","00;46;16;29","that's attached to it."
"00;46;16;29","00;46;18;28","But I'm not I'm not suggesting"
"00;46;18;28","00;46;20;17","a general formal framework"
"00;46;20;17","00;46;22;14","that has a metric in itself."
"00;46;22;14","00;46;24;23","So I'm setting case by case."
"00;46;25;17","00;46;28;09","So can you maybe provide some examples"
"00;46;28;09","00;46;29;11","or you don't want to say it"
"00;46;29;11","00;46;31;21","too much in biology?"
"00;46;32;02","00;46;34;03","Uh huh, yeah."
"00;46;34;03","00;46;35;05","It's the fucking behavior."
"00;46;35;05","00;46;36;06","So there are different,"
"00;46;36;06","00;46;37;19","different models that I can,"
"00;46;37;19","00;46;38;01","you can,"
"00;46;38;01","00;46;39;17","you can send me an email if you want"
"00;46;39;17","00;46;40;03","and I can"
"00;46;40;03","00;46;42;00","address you to some literature,"
"00;46;42;00","00;46;43;03","but there are plenty of modern"
"00;46;43;03","00;46;45;06","so fucking behavior, right?"
"00;46;45;06","00;46;46;03","But you know"
"00;46;46;03","00;46;46;23","that use"
"00;46;46;23","00;46;47;28","models that are already"
"00;46;47;28","00;46;48;29","so that sort of"
"00;46;48;29","00;46;50;26","migrate models from physics."
"00;46;50;26","00;46;52;13","So some of them use"
"00;46;54;00","00;46;55;22","a slightly revised version of"
"00;46;55;22","00;46;58;19","the, of the icing model"
"00;46;59;25","00;47;00;13","it makes me"
"00;47;00;13","00;47;02;22","think about how the sort of"
"00;47;03;07","00;47;05;13","initial target system,"
"00;47;05;13","00;47;06;14","let's just say a solid"
"00;47;06;14","00;47;08;25","to a liquid phase transition"
"00;47;08;25","00;47;12;12","and then there also are potentially"
"00;47;12;12","00;47;15;15","critical dynamics related to information"
"00;47;16;06","00;47;17;25","and decision making"
"00;47;17;25","00;47;19;02","which comes into play"
"00;47;19;02","00;47;22;03","in active inference where you could have"
"00;47;23;07","00;47;25;20","a non-linear"
"00;47;25;20","00;47;26;11","relationship"
"00;47;26;11","00;47;27;27","between information coming in"
"00;47;27;27","00;47;29;06","and then it's in policy mode."
"00;47;29;06","00;47;31;27","A And then there's a phase transition to"
"00;47;32;06","00;47;35;01","policy B, and so"
"00;47;35;01","00;47;36;06","it's kind of like again, that vital"
"00;47;36;06","00;47;37;22","ism 1.0, 2.0"
"00;47;37;22","00;47;39;13","there's going to be a lower bar,"
"00;47;39;13","00;47;41;04","a phase transition to talk about,"
"00;47;41;04","00;47;41;28","well, the protein"
"00;47;41;28","00;47;43;28","folding in the cell, it's"
"00;47;43;28","00;47;45;04","going to be a special"
"00;47;45;04","00;47;46;24","surrounding that facilitates it"
"00;47;46;24","00;47;47;05","to do"
"00;47;47;05","00;47;50;05","special kind of transitions physically."
"00;47;50;21","00;47;51;05","But then"
"00;47;51;05","00;47;54;07","how do we think about higher order"
"00;47;54;14","00;47;56;00","behavioral properties,"
"00;47;56;00","00;47;58;26","especially when they exhibit some"
"00;47;59;08","00;48;01;11","tantalizing similarity"
"00;48;01;11","00;48;03;07","or analogy or metaphor"
"00;48;03;07","00;48;06;07","like we've been discussing, but"
"00;48;06;15","00;48;09;07","can we just take those same models"
"00;48;09;12","00;48;10;09","and think that it's going to be"
"00;48;10;09","00;48;12;22","as clean all the way up blue?"
"00;48;12;22","00;48;13;18","And then Steven"
"00;48;16;01","00;48;18;17","so in the flocking model,"
"00;48;19;12","00;48;20;20","for example, like"
"00;48;20;20","00;48;21;00","and you're"
"00;48;21;00","00;48;24;02","talking about downward causation"
"00;48;24;02","00;48;24;28","and something"
"00;48;24;28","00;48;26;18","as something that you wish to study."
"00;48;26;18","00;48;26;25","And so"
"00;48;26;25","00;48;27;24","I'm sure that you've"
"00;48;27;24","00;48;29;12","maybe read the Information"
"00;48;29;12","00;48;30;28","Theory of Individuality paper"
"00;48;30;28","00;48;32;07","by David Krakauer"
"00;48;32;07","00;48;34;01","and the group at the Institute."
"00;48;34;01","00;48;37;05","So there's a point in which,"
"00;48;37;18","00;48;39;00","you know, this, like group of birds"
"00;48;39;00","00;48;40;21","that's like flying around,"
"00;48;40;21","00;48;43;07","you know, kind of chaotically"
"00;48;43;07","00;48;45;19","assembles and forms like a flock and"
"00;48;45;19","00;48;47;14","and flies together"
"00;48;47;14","00;48;49;16","in like a kind of patterns way."
"00;48;49;16","00;48;50;14","And so,"
"00;48;50;14","00;48;50;23","like,"
"00;48;50;23","00;48;51;26","I'm interested in"
"00;48;51;26","00;48;55;21","in terms of criticality at what point is"
"00;48;56;04","00;48;58;07","the does downward causation occur?"
"00;48;58;23","00;49;00;11","And is that the point that then"
"00;49;00;11","00;49;02;06","it stops being like that"
"00;49;02;06","00;49;04;15","the ensemble becomes a group, a unit"
"00;49;04;15","00;49;05;15","that's functional,"
"00;49;05;15","00;49;06;01","like, you know,"
"00;49;06;01","00;49;07;23","because it's like that's a good"
"00;49;07;23","00;49;10;18","kind of way to look at emergence."
"00;49;10;18","00;49;12;26","But how do you find that point"
"00;49;13;07","00;49;14;18","in which there's"
"00;49;14;18","00;49;16;14","that bidirectional information flow?"
"00;49;16;14","00;49;17;13","So the so that's that's"
"00;49;17;13","00;49;18;06","maybe a better way"
"00;49;18;06","00;49;19;20","to phrase my question."
"00;49;19;20","00;49;20;07","Yeah."
"00;49;20;07","00;49;22;01","So I say this great."
"00;49;22;01","00;49;22;28","Discuss this with you."
"00;49;22;28","00;49;24;21","But as I said, having done"
"00;49;24;21","00;49;25;25","the whole research,"
"00;49;25;25","00;49;28;17","I'm happy to discuss my two issues here"
"00;49;29;18","00;49;30;23","with both of you."
"00;49;30;23","00;49;32;00","But that's it."
"00;49;32;00","00;49;33;01","Yeah."
"00;49;34;15","00;49;37;05","I saw one of the hypotheses that I have"
"00;49;37;05","00;49;38;20","is that you might find something"
"00;49;38;20","00;49;39;06","like I'm"
"00;49;39;06","00;49;41;03","well known work in downward"
"00;49;41;03","00;49;43;00","causation in biological systems"
"00;49;43;00","00;49;44;10","I'm not sure of looking"
"00;49;44;10","00;49;46;03","behavior would be the place"
"00;49;46;03","00;49;48;10","to find them, work on them, but"
"00;49;48;10","00;49;49;19","I'm thinking about them work."
"00;49;49;19","00;49;52;00","I've done one session in terms of cell"
"00;49;53;11","00;49;55;02","and it might be that"
"00;49;55;02","00;49;57;09","you need some high order properties"
"00;49;58;16","00;50;00;29","so that so that high order properties"
"00;50;00;29","00;50;04;05","explain some fitness"
"00;50;04;05","00;50;06;28","and that in that way that calls somehow"
"00;50;06;28","00;50;08;11","all the way down."
"00;50;08;11","00;50;09;12","But"
"00;50;10;06","00;50;12;15","at the micro scale, at the micro level,"
"00;50;12;15","00;50;13;17","you observe some behavior"
"00;50;13;17","00;50;16;00","as a result that fitness that is"
"00;50;16;20","00;50;18;27","of course great or high."
"00;50;20;17","00;50;22;11","So I'm thinking about that vocalization"
"00;50;22;11","00;50;24;12","in that in those terms,"
"00;50;25;05","00;50;26;04","but you might find"
"00;50;26;04","00;50;28;05","other notions of downward causation"
"00;50;28;08","00;50;30;10","there and I might found them in"
"00;50;30;19","00;50;31;13","doing the research"
"00;50;32;29","00;50;34;01","now in the flocking"
"00;50;34;01","00;50;35;05","behavior, I'm not sure,"
"00;50;35;05","00;50;38;15","but you might think that they're the"
"00;50;38;28","00;50;41;19","the ability of many of many birds to"
"00;50;41;19","00;50;43;02","to go in a particular"
"00;50;43;02","00;50;44;11","to do a particular"
"00;50;44;11","00;50;45;26","pattern, has some"
"00;50;45;26","00;50;48;09","some fitness associated to it."
"00;50;48;09","00;50;51;04","And he saw that fitness which is fitness"
"00;50;51;19","00;50;53;08","of a group, might explain"
"00;50;53;08","00;50;54;23","the individual behavior."
"00;50;54;23","00;50;55;27","So if that's correct,"
"00;50;55;27","00;50;56;18","then you might have"
"00;50;56;18","00;50;57;29","a notion of done workouts"
"00;50;57;29","00;50;59;12","and that you don't find"
"00;50;59;12","00;51;00;28","necessarily in physics."
"00;51;00;28","00;51;03;04","But this is just"
"00;51;03;04","00;51;06;04","these are preliminary intuitions."
"00;51;06;06","00;51;08;11","Thank you bloop."
"00;51;08;25","00;51;11;05","So like going towards like"
"00;51;11;19","00;51;13;08","along those lines"
"00;51;13;08","00;51;16;07","and going back maybe to the attractor."
"00;51;16;26","00;51;19;11","So so when there is like a"
"00;51;19;12","00;51;21;06","the emergence of a group, does"
"00;51;21;06","00;51;22;23","does that like rain,"
"00;51;22;23","00;51;25;03","all of the individuals in the group"
"00;51;25;03","00;51;26;06","like closer"
"00;51;26;06","00;51;28;09","to a new attractive state"
"00;51;28;09","00;51;30;00","or closer together"
"00;51;30;00","00;51;31;14","like tighter like a tighter"
"00;51;31;14","00;51;33;10","cluster around an attractive state"
"00;51;33;10","00;51;35;03","or is it like the new attractor state"
"00;51;35;03","00;51;36;25","is an emergent property of the group"
"00;51;36;25","00;51;39;11","or how do those two fit together?"
"00;51;39;11","00;51;41;21","Like in terms of fitness"
"00;51;41;21","00;51;43;24","and you know, in biological fitness"
"00;51;43;24","00;51;45;00","you have to be able to maintain"
"00;51;45;00","00;51;45;22","this kind of non"
"00;51;45;22","00;51;48;00","equilibrium steady state density"
"00;51;48;25","00;51;50;21","so in terms of fitness of a group"
"00;51;50;21","00;51;51;17","or a cluster"
"00;51;51;17","00;51;53;03","and biological systems,"
"00;51;53;03","00;51;55;13","is that that the new attractor"
"00;51;55;13","00;51;57;12","or is there"
"00;51;57;12","00;51;58;17","just what are your intuitions"
"00;51;58;17","00;51;59;07","maybe about that?"
"00;52;00;09","00;52;00;28","Yeah, so"
"00;52;00;28","00;52;02;05","I wouldn't I wouldn't"
"00;52;02;05","00;52;03;24","try to describe the notion"
"00;52;03;24","00;52;05;06","of emergence here"
"00;52;05;06","00;52;06;14","in terms of structures,"
"00;52;06;14","00;52;08;21","but it may be useful in the end."
"00;52;09;12","00;52;11;25","But I would like to"
"00;52;11;25","00;52;15;00","to have a notion of emergence that is"
"00;52;15;04","00;52;15;18","that doesn't"
"00;52;15;18","00;52;17;05","rely necessarily on attractors,"
"00;52;17;05","00;52;19;03","because I think that"
"00;52;19;09","00;52;21;07","finding attractive is is a hard"
"00;52;21;07","00;52;22;14","task in biology."
"00;52;22;14","00;52;23;28","And some of these models don't work"
"00;52;23;28","00;52;25;03","with that practice anyway."
"00;52;25;03","00;52;26;01","So I don't I don't"
"00;52;26;01","00;52;28;05","I don't think the notion of convergence"
"00;52;28;05","00;52;29;17","needs to be associated."
"00;52;29;17","00;52;31;29","This is only to attract to"
"00;52;31;29","00;52;33;03","maybe in some cases"
"00;52;33;03","00;52;34;03","it would be useful"
"00;52;34;03","00;52;35;23","to understand emergence in that sense."
"00;52;35;23","00;52;36;22","But I wouldn't"
"00;52;36;22","00;52;37;10","think that it's"
"00;52;37;10","00;52;39;01","necessary to understand emergence"
"00;52;39;01","00;52;40;28","and sense of stuff attract."
"00;52;40;28","00;52;42;09","And I agree with you."
"00;52;42;09","00;52;45;16","But but like the coupling of emergence"
"00;52;45;16","00;52;47;09","maybe to fitness"
"00;52;47;09","00;52;50;05","to me, like I link fitness to a chapter."
"00;52;50;11","00;52;52;27","And so it's hard for me to separate them"
"00;52;53;07","00;52;57;05","if if fitness is linked to it active,"
"00;52;57;05","00;53;00;06","but fitness is is not linked to"
"00;53;00;22","00;53;02;20","or is also linked to emergence,"
"00;53;02;20","00;53;03;03","then that"
"00;53;03;03","00;53;04;16","that draws a line for me"
"00;53;04;16","00;53;06;25","between emergence and chapter"
"00;53;06;28","00;53;08;09","if that makes sense. Yes."
"00;53;08;09","00;53;09;12","So that's why I will work"
"00;53;09;12","00;53;11;06","with biologists on this project."
"00;53;11;06","00;53;12;22","I'm not a biologist myself,"
"00;53;12;22","00;53;15;19","but I think that fitness can be"
"00;53;15;19","00;53;17;08","defined also independent"
"00;53;17;08","00;53;19;01","emotional attractors."
"00;53;19;01","00;53;20;28","And I would try to take those notions"
"00;53;22;06","00;53;23;04","who we would try to"
"00;53;23;04","00;53;25;12","adopt this those definitions."
"00;53;25;12","00;53;26;05","So, Dave,"
"00;53;26;05","00;53;27;16","just because you haven't"
"00;53;27;16","00;53;29;23","asked the question yet then. Steve."
"00;53;29;23","00;53;30;00","Yeah."
"00;53;30;02","00;53;31;03","One of the reasons"
"00;53;31;03","00;53;32;28","that looking for attract,"
"00;53;32;28","00;53;33;15","let's spend"
"00;53;33;15","00;53;34;05","too much time"
"00;53;34;05","00;53;36;15","looking for attractors associated"
"00;53;36;15","00;53;36;25","with them"
"00;53;36;25","00;53;38;19","with emergence is"
"00;53;38;19","00;53;40;07","among the things that happens"
"00;53;40;07","00;53;41;08","when you get emergent"
"00;53;41;08","00;53;42;07","behavior is"
"00;53;42;07","00;53;44;07","there is a more differentiated"
"00;53;44;24","00;53;48;17","set of interfaces with the outer world."
"00;53;49;05","00;53;50;13","And because of that,"
"00;53;50;13","00;53;52;10","there's less duplication"
"00;53;52;10","00;53;53;21","and less"
"00;53;53;21","00;53;58;03","resemblance among the subsystems"
"00;53;58;03","00;54;01;13","already within the overall system."
"00;54;05;01","00;54;05;14","Cool."
"00;54;05;14","00;54;07;13","Thank you Steven."
"00;54;09;18","00;54;10;25","Yeah, that's a good point"
"00;54;10;25","00;54;12;09","around the challenge"
"00;54;12;09","00;54;13;29","of identifying that that attract"
"00;54;13;29","00;54;14;24","especially if you've got this"
"00;54;14;24","00;54;16;19","multi scale nested."
"00;54;16;19","00;54;18;00","I mean so you've got attractors"
"00;54;18;00","00;54;20;23","that are only present for nanoseconds,"
"00;54;21;09","00;54;21;28","you know,"
"00;54;21;28","00;54;22;27","even if they're there"
"00;54;22;27","00;54;23;27","and there's millions and"
"00;54;23;27","00;54;24;22","billions of them"
"00;54;26;09","00;54;26;19","then on"
"00;54;26;19","00;54;27;20","top of that you"
"00;54;27;20","00;54;27;28","so I"
"00;54;27;28","00;54;28;14","can imagine"
"00;54;28;14","00;54;29;23","that it could be really useful."
"00;54;29;23","00;54;32;00","And I I'm curious"
"00;54;33;06","00;54;35;04","how you see that, you know,"
"00;54;35;04","00;54;37;13","the freezing of ice"
"00;54;37;13","00;54;38;06","and the way that,"
"00;54;38;06","00;54;40;04","you know, water becomes more dense"
"00;54;40;04","00;54;41;18","and actually"
"00;54;41;18","00;54;43;03","about two degrees and starts"
"00;54;43;03","00;54;44;20","to get less dense"
"00;54;44;20","00;54;46;12","and as it approaches freezing"
"00;54;46;12","00;54;47;03","and then you sort of"
"00;54;47;03","00;54;50;15","have this phase transition"
"00;54;50;15","00;54;53;00","and I think there's a real use in that"
"00;54;53;05","00;54;54;20","also being learned"
"00;54;54;20","00;54;56;24","about for acts of influence"
"00;54;56;24","00;54;57;29","because although an active influence"
"00;54;57;29","00;54;58;13","doesn't happen"
"00;54;58;13","00;55;01;05","directly in the field of anything"
"00;55;01;05","00;55;02;07","to do with entropy,"
"00;55;02;07","00;55;04;07","there's this common misconception"
"00;55;04;07","00;55;05;22","of nick entropy"
"00;55;05;22","00;55;06;22","as if you actually get"
"00;55;06;22","00;55;09;00","a negative form of entropy,"
"00;55;09;00","00;55;10;25","which is kind of in the"
"00;55;10;25","00;55;12;15","in the kind of common usage."
"00;55;12;15","00;55;13;20","But there's no such thing"
"00;55;13;20","00;55;15;25","directly as innate entropy it is a"
"00;55;16;04","00;55;18;12","as a negative change in entropy."
"00;55;18;28","00;55;19;09","You know,"
"00;55;19;09","00;55;21;00","there can be a variation in in topic,"
"00;55;21;00","00;55;22;11","but it's not"
"00;55;22;16","00;55;23;18","the stable state"
"00;55;23;18","00;55;24;26","in the same way that you get"
"00;55;24;26","00;55;26;16","with energy. But that that"
"00;55;27;16","00;55;27;27","I think that"
"00;55;27;27","00;55;30;00","can be a misconception."
"00;55;30;29","00;55;32;15","So creeps in quite a lot."
"00;55;32;15","00;55;34;20","I'd be curious if"
"00;55;34;27","00;55;36;28","I, you know,"
"00;55;38;03","00;55;40;04","effectively, you know, there's,"
"00;55;40;04","00;55;40;16","there's,"
"00;55;40;16","00;55;42;26","there's a value of entropy"
"00;55;42;26","00;55;43;18","that goes down"
"00;55;43;18","00;55;45;04","with spooky value of entropy,"
"00;55;45;04","00;55;46;09","which no one quite knows"
"00;55;46;09","00;55;47;19","what's going on with the entropy."
"00;55;47;19","00;55;48;21","We know there's a value"
"00;55;48;21","00;55;51;07","for entropy, that entropy goes"
"00;55;51;21","00;55;53;25","changes in from ice to water"
"00;55;54;11","00;55;56;08","but you know, even"
"00;55;56;08","00;55;57;21","Richard Feynman used to say, well,"
"00;55;57;21","00;55;58;16","no one quite knows"
"00;55;58;16","00;55;59;19","what's going on there."
"00;55;59;19","00;56;01;07","And maybe this is"
"00;56;01;07","00;56;02;17","something that you're trying to sort of"
"00;56;02;17","00;56;03;10","get into"
"00;56;03;10","00;56;04;13","is what's going on"
"00;56;04;13","00;56;06;11","in those phase transitions"
"00;56;06;11","00;56;07;28","and these entropic changes,"
"00;56;07;28","00;56;10;08","which doesn't have the benefit,"
"00;56;10;08","00;56;11;24","like you say, of some agents"
"00;56;11;24","00;56;14;12","who drive of the free energy"
"00;56;14;12","00;56;15;20","principle to make it happen."
"00;56;15;20","00;56;17;11","So I don't know what your thoughts are,"
"00;56;17;11","00;56;18;21","but how that might even"
"00;56;18;21","00;56;20;20","how that might be useful"
"00;56;20;20","00;56;21;25","to help people"
"00;56;21;25","00;56;23;27","who aren't as heavily into physics."
"00;56;24;05","00;56;27;16","Just think about the idea of change"
"00;56;27;23","00;56;29;01","and entropy,"
"00;56;29;01","00;56;30;07","because I think it's it's"
"00;56;30;07","00;56;31;07","going to become something"
"00;56;31;07","00;56;33;18","that more and more people are using"
"00;56;33;18","00;56;34;26","outside of physics."
"00;56;40;18","00;56;42;24","If you have any thoughts."
"00;56;42;24","00;56;43;11","Otherwise, just"
"00;56;43;11","00;56;46;03","the maximum density is for C for water."
"00;56;46;21","00;56;48;17","And it's super, super slight,"
"00;56;48;17","00;56;51;01","but a very interesting pattern"
"00;56;54;06","00;56;54;29","OK,"
"00;56;56;23","00;56;58;17","we can turn to well,"
"00;56;58;17","00;57;01;03","if anyone wants to raise their hand"
"00;57;02;03","00;57;04;29","or give a thought"
"00;57;05;21","00;57;07;27","Steven, you said that the entropy as"
"00;57;08;04","00;57;09;19","it might not exist"
"00;57;09;19","00;57;10;10","was one thing"
"00;57;10;10","00;57;12;21","and there's no such thing as entropy."
"00;57;13;03","00;57;13;27","Well, yeah."
"00;57;13;27","00;57;16;11","I also wanted to sorry about that."
"00;57;16;28","00;57;20;05","Yeah, I yeah, I also wanted to, to,"
"00;57;20;07","00;57;22;06","to stress that in equilibrium"
"00;57;22;06","00;57;23;06","phase transitions,"
"00;57;23;06","00;57;24;11","if this if you don't use"
"00;57;24;11","00;57;25;23","the notion of negative entropy,"
"00;57;25;23","00;57;28;26","of course you use entropy and standard"
"00;57;28;26","00;57;29;26","statistical mechanics"
"00;57;29;26","00;57;33;08","plus randomization group methods"
"00;57;34;05","00;57;36;29","so that my, my B"
"00;57;37;10","00;57;38;12","and a symmetry"
"00;57;38;12","00;57;39;26","with some of the case studies"
"00;57;39;26","00;57;41;15","that I analyzed in biology. But"
"00;57;42;13","00;57;43;23","I would"
"00;57;44;15","00;57;46;27","and one of the fundamental tradeoffs"
"00;57;46;27","00;57;48;16","discussed in the paper"
"00;57;48;16","00;57;51;04","was this generality versus"
"00;57;51;04","00;57;52;07","the plausibility"
"00;57;52;07","00;57;55;13","and the realism do attractors even exist"
"00;57;55;23","00;57;58;28","or is it just as if a system is moving"
"00;57;58;29","00;58;00;15","towards something but does,"
"00;58;00;15","00;58;02;07","does something that"
"00;58;02;13","00;58;04;29","is not realized exist?"
"00;58;04;29","00;58;06;26","And so this kind of"
"00;58;06;26","00;58;09;15","takes us to talking about"
"00;58;09;15","00;58;11;01","whether we're describing the system"
"00;58;11;01","00;58;14;04","as it is or rather situating the system"
"00;58;14;18","00;58;15;22","in a broader space"
"00;58;15;22","00;58;17;04","of how it could exist."
"00;58;17;04","00;58;17;25","And that was one of"
"00;58;17;25","00;58;19;15","the fundamental points of the paper"
"00;58;19;15","00;58;20;16","about the challenges"
"00;58;20;16","00;58;21;13","of discovering"
"00;58;21;13","00;58;23;11","the appropriate face space"
"00;58;23;11","00;58;25;26","for a biological system."
"00;58;25;26","00;58;26;20","So"
"00;58;28;01","00;58;30;16","it's just cool because these are not"
"00;58;31;00","00;58;34;22","knock down punches for fip and active,"
"00;58;35;25","00;58;37;21","nor are they trivial."
"00;58;37;21","00;58;39;04","They're in that"
"00;58;39;04","00;58;40;29","optimally informative"
"00;58;40;29","00;58;42;23","or confusing space,"
"00;58;42;23","00;58;43;22","you know, between zero"
"00;58;43;22","00;58;47;12","and one probability where it does matter"
"00;58;47;26","00;58;50;19","and where philosophy comes into play and"
"00;58;51;08","00;58;51;23","where the"
"00;58;51;23","00;58;53;09","the specifics of the situation"
"00;58;53;09","00;58;53;25","come into play, we"
"00;58;53;25","00;58;54;29","can't just simply make"
"00;58;57;25","00;58;59;06","arguments without reference"
"00;58;59;06","00;59;01;13","to a specific model."
"00;59;01;13","00;59;02;07","But then are"
"00;59;02;07","00;59;03;27","we trap to just describing"
"00;59;03;27","00;59;05;27","specific models, specific papers,"
"00;59;05;27","00;59;08;21","or are we able to go beyond that ever"
"00;59;12;22","00;59;13;29","I'm just looking through"
"00;59;13;29","00;59;15;12","if anyone wants to raise their hand"
"00;59;15;12","00;59;17;12","or any about that."
"00;59;17;12","00;59;18;04","Sorry."
"00;59;19;10","00;59;22;12","So we do raise a concern"
"00;59;22;12","00;59;24;16","about the existence of structures."
"00;59;25;15","00;59;26;19","Of course, structures"
"00;59;26;19","00;59;28;18","don't exist in nature"
"00;59;28;18","00;59;29;12","because you need"
"00;59;29;12","00;59;30;28","you need take in infinite limits"
"00;59;30;28","00;59;32;28","in order to find structures in a model."
"00;59;33;01","00;59;34;16","And you cannot decide"
"00;59;34;16","00;59;36;12","infinite are not realistic, right?"
"00;59;36;12","00;59;38;17","So we can not take systems"
"00;59;39;05","00;59;40;05","and take an infinite"
"00;59;40;05","00;59;41;03","amount of processes."
"00;59;41;03","00;59;42;25","Don't take any for that amount of time."
"00;59;42;25","00;59;45;25","And you cannot repeat an iteration"
"00;59;45;25","00;59;46;09","in rendering"
"00;59;46;09","00;59;47;22","applications of transformation"
"00;59;47;22","00;59;50;02","infinitely many times in a"
"00;59;50;02","00;59;50;25","realistic way."
"00;59;50;25","00;59;52;28","Of course, these are all idealization."
"00;59;52;28","00;59;53;22","But in principle"
"00;59;53;22","00;59;55;21","I wanted to stress that we don't have"
"00;59;55;21","00;59;57;25","we don't have a problem with that."
"00;59;57;25","00;59;58;15","So of course"
"00;59;58;15","00;59;59;07","any model"
"00;59;59;07","01;00;00;16","that uses attractors wouldn't"
"01;00;00;16","01;00;02;27","be realistic in a way."
"01;00;02;27","01;00;05;05","So you will be using an idealization."
"01;00;05;05","01;00;06;10","That's true,"
"01;00;06;10","01;00;08;11","but we don't have a problem with that."
"01;00;08;11","01;00;11;01","If the idealization can be justified."
"01;00;11;01","01;00;12;11","I think in many cases,"
"01;00;12;11","01;00;13;21","especially for example,"
"01;00;13;21","01;00;14;27","in, in,"
"01;00;14;27","01;00;17;27","in, in the treatment of face transitions"
"01;00;18;04","01;00;20;18","in physics where you use limits,"
"01;00;21;01","01;00;22;13","there's a way of justifying"
"01;00;22;13","01;00;23;23","those limits and justifying"
"01;00;23;23","01;00;25;14","the existence of structures."
"01;00;25;14","01;00;26;29","And therefore,"
"01;00;26;29","01;00;29;00","even if you meet some realism"
"01;00;29;00","01;00;30;09","in the model of your view"
"01;00;30;09","01;00;32;03","of your physical system,"
"01;00;32;03","01;00;34;04","since that idealization is justified,"
"01;00;34;04","01;00;35;10","but that is plausible"
"01;00;35;10","01;00;37;14","so that that that model is plausible"
"01;00;37;14","01;00;39;01","and it's legitimate"
"01;00;39;01","01;00;40;11","what we are what we are"
"01;00;41;25","01;00;44;00","worrying about in the paper is that it"
"01;00;44;00","01;00;46;11","may happen that sometimes"
"01;00;46;11","01;00;48;28","the models that they try to model"
"01;00;49;12","01;00;50;12","many systems"
"01;00;50;12","01;00;52;23","in terms of structures are not really."
"01;00;52;23","01;00;54;05","So they can not justify"
"01;00;54;05","01;00;56;05","the organizations that have been made"
"01;00;56;05","01;00;56;17","in order"
"01;00;56;17","01;00;57;14","to model"
"01;00;57;14","01;00;58;12","plenty of systems"
"01;00;58;12","01;01;00;18","in terms of attractors."
"01;01;00;18","01;01;02;22","So I just wanted to clarify that"
"01;01;02;22","01;01;03;06","because we"
"01;01;03;06","01;01;05;05","don't disagree in principle"
"01;01;05;05","01;01;07;04","with the idea of"
"01;01;07;04","01;01;09;12","using models that appeal to attractors,"
"01;01;09;21","01;01;11;05","even if attractive don't exist."
"01;01;11;05","01;01;11;27","In reality,"
"01;01;11;27","01;01;13;06","our problem is one"
"01;01;13;06","01;01;13;29","with the possibility"
"01;01;13;29","01;01;15;04","of finding structures"
"01;01;15;04","01;01;15;26","in the first place"
"01;01;15;26","01;01;18;01","or finding asymptotic solutions."
"01;01;18;16","01;01;21;13","And the second is about the possibility"
"01;01;21;13","01;01;22;10","of justifying"
"01;01;22;10","01;01;23;26","the stations that are involved"
"01;01;23;26","01;01;25;09","when you use"
"01;01;25;20","01;01;26;10","attractors"
"01;01;26;10","01;01;29;00","or when you appeal to attractive."
"01;01;29;00","01;01;29;19","Yes."
"01;01;29;19","01;01;32;26","And like many other arguments"
"01;01;32;26","01;01;34;04","in biology, it's a little bit"
"01;01;34;04","01;01;35;13","like the anthropic"
"01;01;35;13","01;01;36;25","principle or fallacy, depending"
"01;01;36;25","01;01;37;26","on which side you're on."
"01;01;37;26","01;01;38;27","It's like"
"01;01;38;29","01;01;40;11","you mentioned in the paper,"
"01;01;40;11","01;01;41;19","you have to prove the existence"
"01;01;41;19","01;01;42;26","of the attractor"
"01;01;42;26","01;01;43;09","as well"
"01;01;43;09","01;01;44;07","as, as we discussed,"
"01;01;44;07","01;01;45;28","the time to convergence"
"01;01;45;28","01;01;48;12","and then justify why certain attractors"
"01;01;48;29","01;01;50;26","denote homeostatic states."
"01;01;50;26","01;01;53;14","And one biologists answer is just"
"01;01;53;19","01;01;55;13","those are the living systems."
"01;01;55;13","01;01;57;19","If the attractor weren't"
"01;01;57;19","01;01;58;28","a homeostatic state"
"01;01;58;28","01;02;00;24","or a high fitness state,"
"01;02;00;24","01;02;02;07","that is not going to be"
"01;02;02;07","01;02;04;04","an anti sea around for long."
"01;02;04;04","01;02;06;14","And so we can just say that"
"01;02;06;23","01;02;08;12","if there is an attractor"
"01;02;08;12","01;02;08;29","and indeed"
"01;02;08;29","01;02;10;28","it's as if there's an attractor"
"01;02;10;28","01;02;12;20","for persistent systems,"
"01;02;12;20","01;02;14;19","that's the adaptive one period."
"01;02;14;19","01;02;17;04","And the second that it's not that way"
"01;02;17;04","01;02;18;23","the system fails to exist."
"01;02;18;23","01;02;20;25","So that's the sort of circular"
"01;02;21;03","01;02;24;14","but often impenetrable tautology"
"01;02;24;21","01;02;27;26","of selection and persistence of systems."
"01;02;28;01","01;02;28;12","Blue"
"01;02;30;26","01;02;32;08","So that's a nice"
"01;02;32;08","01;02;32;29","transition"
"01;02;32;29","01;02;34;09","perhaps into the question"
"01;02;34;09","01;02;37;01","that I've had about"
"01;02;37;03","01;02;38;21","dynamic equilibrium"
"01;02;38;21","01;02;40;23","versus a non equilibrium"
"01;02;40;23","01;02;42;11","steady state density."
"01;02;42;11","01;02;42;25","So I don't know"
"01;02;42;25","01;02;43;23","if you want to flip to that"
"01;02;43;23","01;02;45;18","slide, Daniel, but"
"01;02;45;22","01;02;48;02","there's several quotes in the paper"
"01;02;48;02","01;02;52;05","where the the I'm not sure exactly"
"01;02;52;05","01;02;53;21","what's referred to"
"01;02;53;21","01;02;55;19","as a dynamic equilibrium."
"01;02;55;19","01;02;58;03","I'm assuming that it's"
"01;02;58;03","01;03;00;23","homeostasis but"
"01;03;00;23","01;03;02;05","I just was wondering why."
"01;03;02;05","01;03;04;26","Because a dynamic equilibrium is"
"01;03;05;19","01;03;07;28","a reversible chemical reaction"
"01;03;08;15","01;03;11;24","and there's nothing about homeostasis"
"01;03;11;24","01;03;12;16","that is."
"01;03;12;16","01;03;12;24","I mean,"
"01;03;12;24","01;03;13;19","there may be some things,"
"01;03;13;19","01;03;14;15","but not everything"
"01;03;14;15","01;03;16;19","about maintaining homeostasis"
"01;03;16;19","01;03;19;05","is has to do with reversibility."
"01;03;20;09","01;03;22;14","So I just was wondering,"
"01;03;23;12","01;03;25;15","all biological systems actively maintain"
"01;03;25;15","01;03;26;21","a dynamic equilibrium"
"01;03;26;21","01;03;27;17","with their environment"
"01;03;27;17","01;03;30;24","and what is meant by that"
"01;03;33;25","01;03;36;17","this was a quote from the paper"
"01;03;48;15","01;03;49;12","about your muted Patricia."
"01;03;49;12","01;03;51;29","But if you have any thoughts"
"01;03;54;08","01;03;54;24","yeah."
"01;03;54;24","01;03;55;20","So sorry"
"01;03;55;20","01;03;57;26","I was missing the screen somehow."
"01;03;57;26","01;04;00;06","OK, so"
"01;04;00;23","01;04;01;16","yeah."
"01;04;01;16","01;04;02;25","So actually,"
"01;04;02;25","01;04;04;00","unfortunately, my dear,"
"01;04;04;00","01;04;06;21","I wanted to answer that in a, in a"
"01;04;07;09","01;04;08;27","in a need way."
"01;04;08;27","01;04;09;25","Basically,"
"01;04;09;25","01;04;11;03","we took these"
"01;04;11;03","01;04;13;03","from Frank Freestone himself."
"01;04;13;03","01;04;14;29","So he refers in many places"
"01;04;14;29","01;04;16;17","and he had liquidations and so on."
"01;04;16;17","01;04;17;19","I don't have that at the moment."
"01;04;17;19","01;04;20;03","I can try to look at it, but"
"01;04;20;15","01;04;20;24","know."
"01;04;20;24","01;04;22;07","So you might be right."
"01;04;22;07","01;04;23;24","It's not the right way of,"
"01;04;23;24","01;04;26;06","of describing the almost steady state,"
"01;04;26;06","01;04;27;26","but I think it's a mistake"
"01;04;27;26","01;04;29;25","that that frees himself thus."
"01;04;29;25","01;04;30;19","I think so"
"01;04;30;19","01;04;31;15","this is basically"
"01;04;31;15","01;04;33;21","what Matthew wanted to say,"
"01;04;33;28","01;04;36;17","and he had this quotations in the papers"
"01;04;36;17","01;04;38;01","where he's upset."
"01;04;38;01","01;04;41;12","So if you want to email him, he will"
"01;04;41;13","01;04;43;17","he will address you to those words."
"01;04;43;17","01;04;44;14","But not no."
"01;04;44;14","01;04;47;03","So not so much in our paper."
"01;04;47;03","01;04;48;10","Depends on that notion."
"01;04;48;10","01;04;48;23","Actually,"
"01;04;48;23","01;04;50;23","so that might be a mistake that we make,"
"01;04;50;23","01;04;55;05","I think because to give freedom in"
"01;04;56;05","01;04;59;02","a but not so much depends on that."
"01;04;59;02","01;05;02;00","So basically our criticisms have to do"
"01;05;02;00","01;05;04;28","with the idea of modeling"
"01;05;05;25","01;05;07;07","all biological states"
"01;05;07;07","01;05;09;15","in terms of random dynamical systems,"
"01;05;09;26","01;05;11;10","in understanding"
"01;05;11;10","01;05;12;11","almost static state"
"01;05;12;11","01;05;13;12","in terms of"
"01;05;13;12","01;05;14;28","dynamical structures"
"01;05;14;28","01;05;17;11","as they're described in the paper."
"01;05;17;11","01;05;20;06","But we don't rely so"
"01;05;20;07","01;05;20;18","much from"
"01;05;20;18","01;05;22;05","the notion of dynamic equilibrium."
"01;05;22;05","01;05;24;18","So that might be just a loose way of the"
"01;05;24;22","01;05;27;20","of understanding almost static states."
"01;05;27;29","01;05;29;01","So it's referring"
"01;05;29;01","01;05;31;10","to homeostasis, though, not dynamics."
"01;05;31;10","01;05;33;25","Yes. OK, yes, yes, yes. To most S's."
"01;05;33;26","01;05;35;14","Yes. Yes."
"01;05;35;20","01;05;37;28","Thank you, Stephen."
"01;05;38;06","01;05;38;12","I mean,"
"01;05;38;12","01;05;40;12","this could be an interesting"
"01;05;40;12","01;05;41;06","area for the"
"01;05;41;06","01;05;43;04","for the ontological work"
"01;05;43;04","01;05;44;16","that's happening in the lab,"
"01;05;44;16","01;05;47;02","because this question of,"
"01;05;47;02","01;05;49;14","you know, is it dynamic equilibrium?"
"01;05;49;14","01;05;50;15","I think like Blue were saying,"
"01;05;50;15","01;05;52;17","there can can be that kind of backwards"
"01;05;52;17","01;05;53;24","and forwards of which"
"01;05;53;24","01;05;54;15","this may be a bit"
"01;05;54;15","01;05;55;25","more of an arrow in one direction."
"01;05;55;25","01;05;56;21","And then you've maybe got"
"01;05;57;27","01;05;58;08","the word"
"01;05;58;08","01;06;00;10","equilibrium as opposed to non"
"01;06;01;10","01;06;03;03","equilibrium."
"01;06;03;03","01;06;03;22","And then you've got this."
"01;06;03;22","01;06;06;19","So he has this nice term, dynamic, cool"
"01;06;07;07","01;06;10;01","systems, you know,"
"01;06;10;06","01;06;11;10","and"
"01;06;12;00","01;06;13;22","as opposed to system dynamics,"
"01;06;13;22","01;06;15;14","which is the kind of the way"
"01;06;15;14","01;06;17;03","that say chemistry"
"01;06;17;03","01;06;17;29","like equilibrium"
"01;06;17;29","01;06;19;01","work is more"
"01;06;19;01","01;06;21;23","system dynamics with dynamic systems."
"01;06;22;26","01;06;24;18","And you've got this interesting thing"
"01;06;24;18","01;06;25;29","because you got this"
"01;06;25;29","01;06;26;22","nonlinear"
"01;06;26;22","01;06;30;14","dynamical work happening at the sort of"
"01;06;30;15","01;06;32;11","the physics level"
"01;06;32;11","01;06;34;09","and this emergent property level."
"01;06;34;09","01;06;36;18","And then at some point,"
"01;06;37;03","01;06;39;09","as it appears from the organisms"
"01;06;39;09","01;06;40;17","perspectives,"
"01;06;40;17","01;06;41;23","we might start turning"
"01;06;41;23","01;06;43;16","and using the language of dynamic"
"01;06;43;16","01;06;45;22","equilibrium ecologically, you know,"
"01;06;45;25","01;06;47;29","ecological equilibrium."
"01;06;47;29","01;06;50;23","And this this shift in"
"01;06;51;15","01;06;54;28","the way that the ontologies present,"
"01;06;55;03","01;06;56;19","which may be true"
"01;06;56;19","01;06;58;20","because as things persist"
"01;06;59;01","01;06;59;27","and they're interacted"
"01;06;59;27","01;07;01;20","with as an entity as"
"01;07;02;25","01;07;04;20","they appear to be,"
"01;07;04;20","01;07;05;18","you know,"
"01;07;05;18","01;07;08;00","in a in a different type of dynamic."
"01;07;08;00","01;07;10;03","But we are seeing from"
"01;07;10;03","01;07;11;08","the active influence"
"01;07;11;08","01;07;13;18","that that dynamic may in itself"
"01;07;13;18","01;07;16;13","be more dynamic than we perceive."
"01;07;16;28","01;07;17;21","So I don't know,"
"01;07;17;21","01;07;19;27","I just thought I'd mention"
"01;07;19;27","01;07;22;08","I don't know if we need an answer."
"01;07;22;08","01;07;23;20","Maybe, Daniel, you got a thought."
"01;07;23;20","01;07;26;11","But there's something about"
"01;07;26;12","01;07;29;05","this shift between biology"
"01;07;29;05","01;07;31;22","and physics at the sort of"
"01;07;32;16","01;07;34;28","at this sort of very"
"01;07;34;28","01;07;37;09","molecular stroke,"
"01;07;37;09","01;07;39;08","you know, theoretical level."
"01;07;39;08","01;07;41;02","And then you've got the idea"
"01;07;41;02","01;07;42;10","of what that means for biology,"
"01;07;42;10","01;07;43;04","and then you've got the idea"
"01;07;43;04","01;07;43;24","of what that means"
"01;07;43;24","01;07;47;08","for biological organisms."
"01;07;47;08","01;07;49;20","And maybe this is something that"
"01;07;49;20","01;07;50;13","we've talked about."
"01;07;50;13","01;07;52;29","This pluralistic ontology"
"01;07;52;29","01;07;55;15","needs to be feasible in the field"
"01;07;55;19","01;07;58;17","because like I say, it depends a thing"
"01;07;58;17","01;08;00;18","that was a very good point."
"01;08;00;18","01;08;01;26","It does depend on"
"01;08;01;26","01;08;04;25","where your models are based and grounded"
"01;08;07;13","01;08;08;14","thanks."
"01;08;08;17","01;08;11;00","Mateo has some very interesting work"
"01;08;11;00","01;08;13;03","on pluralism in biology"
"01;08;13;16","01;08;14;28","and the philosophy of science."
"01;08;14;28","01;08;17;07","So I'd recommend people look there."
"01;08;17;23","01;08;20;08","Now, contingent explanations"
"01;08;20;08","01;08;21;26","are not necessarily plural."
"01;08;21;26","01;08;23;04","One can be an absolutist"
"01;08;23;04","01;08;24;24","and say it depends on the particulars."
"01;08;24;24","01;08;26;25","And there's only one correct story"
"01;08;26;25","01;08;28;17","so it's an open question"
"01;08;28;17","01;08;30;02","to what extent pluralism"
"01;08;30;02","01;08;32;03","and particularity will coexist"
"01;08;32;18","01;08;35;20","and agreed that at the high level"
"01;08;36;04","01;08;38;21","as we mix metaphors,"
"01;08;38;26","01;08;40;27","take ideas across different fields,"
"01;08;41;26","01;08;43;04","we have to be aware"
"01;08;43;04","01;08;44;20","of what is gained and lost,"
"01;08;44;20","01;08;45;16","what are the challenges"
"01;08;45;16","01;08;46;20","and opportunities"
"01;08;46;20","01;08;48;06","of applying"
"01;08;48;06","01;08;50;07","terms from mathematics to physics"
"01;08;50;24","01;08;52;23","and from physics to biology"
"01;08;52;23","01;08;54;11","and taking us all the way"
"01;08;54;11","01;08;57;03","up and down that xkcd comic"
"01;08;57;03","01;09;00;06","that we were looking at earlier."
"01;09;00;06","01;09;02;25","One question area, Patricia,"
"01;09;02;25","01;09;06;16","that I had was about action in the loop."
"01;09;07;09","01;09;07;22","So"
"01;09;09;28","01;09;11;17","maybe there's two parts to it."
"01;09;11;17","01;09;12;03","The first is"
"01;09;12;03","01;09;15;03","just we often hear about FFP"
"01;09;15;03","01;09;16;00","as being akin"
"01;09;16;00","01;09;18;10","to a principle of least action."
"01;09;18;10","01;09;20;29","So just from a physics background,"
"01;09;21;14","01;09;23;12","what does it mean"
"01;09;23;12","01;09;25;10","to be a principal of least action, or"
"01;09;25;10","01;09;25;24","what would it mean"
"01;09;25;24","01;09;28;15","to be like a principal of least action?"
"01;09;28;15","01;09;29;24","And then"
"01;09;30;06","01;09;33;23","how does it change the formalisms"
"01;09;33;23","01;09;34;26","or not?"
"01;09;34;26","01;09;37;15","When we're integrating control"
"01;09;38;01","01;09;38;26","of behavior"
"01;09;38;26","01;09;40;04","kind of control theory,"
"01;09;40;04","01;09;42;04","formalisms or cybernetics"
"01;09;42;04","01;09;44;20","into ensemble modeling?"
"01;09;46;12","01;09;47;25","Because the actions of molecules"
"01;09;47;25","01;09;48;15","are implicit"
"01;09;48;15","01;09;50;26","in the phase transition of"
"01;09;50;26","01;09;52;11","the ensemble of water."
"01;09;52;11","01;09;53;17","But what happens"
"01;09;53;17","01;09;54;23","when we actually have"
"01;09;54;23","01;09;58;00","a control parameter in our equations"
"01;09;59;05","01;10;00;20","like policy"
"01;10;03;04","01;10;03;25","OK, thank you."
"01;10;03;25","01;10;04;27","So first of all, I did"
"01;10;04;27","01;10;05;23","find the papers"
"01;10;05;23","01;10;07;04","where were present uses"
"01;10;07;04","01;10;08;27","the notion of dynamic equilibrium."
"01;10;08;27","01;10;10;17","So for for blue"
"01;10;10;17","01;10;14;10","and he uses a of almost S's."
"01;10;14;10","01;10;16;21","But I cannot use the chart, can you?"
"01;10;17;00","01;10;18;26","Oh, it's on the left side."
"01;10;18;26","01;10;20;05","The bottom left,"
"01;10;20;05","01;10;21;04","it says that enter"
"01;10;21;04","01;10;23;16","a nickname to use to chat you can pick"
"01;10;24;01","01;10;27;12","if you could write it was kind of bust"
"01;10;27;12","01;10;29;23","with this it's ok me trim tab"
"01;10;31;24","01;10;32;16","OK"
"01;10;33;21","01;10;34;04","so"
"01;10;35;00","01;10;36;05","there's sort of a password"
"01;10;36;05","01;10;37;04","so it doesn't have"
"01;10;37;04","01;10;39;16","to do allow everyone to write them but"
"01;10;39;16","01;10;41;11","it doesn't require a title inside name"
"01;10;41;11","01;10;42;25","but the paper"
"01;10;43;14","01;10;45;13","ok good."
"01;10;45;13","01;10;46;21","Those are the papers."
"01;10;46;21","01;10;48;26","So you can take a look at this."
"01;10;48;26","01;10;50;24","So yeah,"
"01;10;50;24","01;10;51;21","but as I said, no,"
"01;10;51;21","01;10;53;22","so not so much in our paper"
"01;10;53;22","01;10;55;16","there have been some that notion of then"
"01;10;55;16","01;10;56;15","so you might disagree"
"01;10;56;15","01;10;57;29","with that lack of recourse."
"01;10;57;29","01;11;00;02","There is,"
"01;11;00;02","01;11;02;13","but yeah, I don't blame us for that."
"01;11;02;13","01;11;04;00","We just OK nice."
"01;11;04;00","01;11;05;22","That was interestingly"
"01;11;05;22","01;11;07;22","not in a peer review paper."
"01;11;07;22","01;11;08;21","Not that it"
"01;11;09;00","01;11;09;24","explains everything,"
"01;11;09;24","01;11;11;04","but he may be speaking"
"01;11;11;04","01;11;12;08","maybe informally"
"01;11;12;08","01;11;14;08","in this essay on peace exactly."
"01;11;14;08","01;11;15;27","I think, I think it's just. Yeah."
"01;11;15;27","01;11;17;18","Or loose way of talking about it."
"01;11;17;18","01;11;19;14","And we also use it because it's useful"
"01;11;19;14","01;11;20;08","then when you speak"
"01;11;20;08","01;11;21;19","about dynamical attractors."
"01;11;21;19","01;11;23;04","So if you have a notion of dynamic"
"01;11;23;04","01;11;24;05","equilibrium, it's just"
"01;11;25;07","01;11;25;22","useful."
"01;11;25;22","01;11;26;01","But of"
"01;11;26;01","01;11;26;23","course we when"
"01;11;26;23","01;11;28;19","we were thinking about the there,"
"01;11;28;19","01;11;29;26","then the proper"
"01;11;29;26","01;11;32;06","definition of dynamical equilibrium"
"01;11;33;29","01;11;35;19","would not just return to the action"
"01;11;35;19","01;11;36;01","question."
"01;11;36;01","01;11;40;02","Yeah, OK, gosh, I got OK."
"01;11;40;02","01;11;43;11","So yeah, again, so we are here."
"01;11;43;11","01;11;45;22","So sorry that I excuse myself"
"01;11;45;22","01;11;48;09","from summarizing the work that presented"
"01;11;49;15","01;11;50;06","but here we are"
"01;11;50;06","01;11;51;06","just summarizing"
"01;11;51;06","01;11;52;26","so we don't give a proper definition"
"01;11;52;26","01;11;54;05","of principle of least action."
"01;11;54;05","01;11;54;10","We're"
"01;11;54;10","01;11;55;19","just relying"
"01;11;55;19","01;11;58;02","on, on, for instance, own definition"
"01;11;58;02","01;12;01;29","and he basically in that paper of 2012,"
"01;12;02;01","01;12;04;02","he needs the principle of,"
"01;12;04;02","01;12;05;15","of least action"
"01;12;05;15","01;12;06;22","in order to formulate"
"01;12;06;22","01;12;08;00","the free energy principle."
"01;12;08;00","01;12;09;14","So the principle of least action"
"01;12;09;14","01;12;11;28","is a step, an intermediate step"
"01;12;12;21","01;12;14;28","to formulate the free energy principle,"
"01;12;15;07","01;12;16;15","nothing more."
"01;12;16;15","01;12;18;09","Then I would be more careful"
"01;12;18;09","01;12;18;29","in talking about"
"01;12;18;29","01;12;21;24","principles of least action in, in the in"
"01;12;21;25","01;12;23;07","phase transitions in physics."
"01;12;23;07","01;12;24;08","I think"
"01;12;24;20","01;12;26;24","you might not even require"
"01;12;26;24","01;12;28;24","any principle of least action there."
"01;12;28;24","01;12;30;22","Or you might talk about those"
"01;12;30;22","01;12;31;20","ground states"
"01;12;31;20","01;12;32;13","as principle"
"01;12;32;13","01;12;34;20","as sort of relying"
"01;12;34;20","01;12;36;03","on a principle of less action,"
"01;12;36;03","01;12;37;07","but I would be more careful"
"01;12;37;07","01;12;39;16","about exporting that notion too"
"01;12;39;16","01;12;41;04","to the physics of face transition."
"01;12;44;19","01;12;45;12","OK,"
"01;12;46;29","01;12;47;18","yes."
"01;12;47;18","01;12;48;21","So that's the first part"
"01;12;48;21","01;12;50;07","about the principle of least action."
"01;12;50;07","01;12;51;04","And then just"
"01;12;51;26","01;12;53;25","is there something"
"01;12;53;25","01;12;55;22","that is changed markedly"
"01;12;55;22","01;12;57;08","when we introduce"
"01;12;57;08","01;12;59;14","these control theoretic"
"01;12;59;14","01;13;02;03","formalisms like policy selection"
"01;13;02;19","01;13;04;20","into physical,"
"01;13;06;06","01;13;09;19","physically inspired or based models"
"01;13;10;02","01;13;12;06","that entail activity"
"01;13;12;16","01;13;14;27","like the thermal motion of particles"
"01;13;15;09","01;13;16;19","but are not approached"
"01;13;16;19","01;13;18;16","from a control theoretic"
"01;13;18;16","01;13;22;15","or behavioral regulatory perspective."
"01;13;25;19","01;13;26;12","Are you thinking about"
"01;13;26;12","01;13;29;26","social systems, for example,"
"01;13;30;26","01;13;32;17","perhaps different kinds of systems,"
"01;13;32;17","01;13;36;29","but mainly just a a particular system"
"01;13;38;00","01;13;40;05","in the way that a free energy"
"01;13;40;05","01;13;41;22","principle for a particular physics"
"01;13;41;22","01;13;43;28","first in 2019 work"
"01;13;43;28","01;13;45;24","like the particle is the blanket"
"01;13;45;24","01;13;47;00","and the internal states"
"01;13;47;00","01;13;49;06","that's engaging in active inference"
"01;13;49;08","01;13;50;09","let's say."
"01;13;50;13","01;13;53;19","And so it is implementing"
"01;13;53;28","01;13;55;20","inference on policy,"
"01;13;55;20","01;13;58;03","it's selecting policy, it's behaving."
"01;13;58;15","01;14;01;24","And so is that sort of policy"
"01;14;01;24","01;14;04;13","selection latent within"
"01;14;05;06","01;14;08;06","non control theoretic activity"
"01;14;08;06","01;14;10;10","based physics models again"
"01;14;10;10","01;14;12;11","like the thermal motion of molecules"
"01;14;12;11","01;14;15;07","or when we introduce policy inference,"
"01;14;16;01","01;14;19;14","does that change some of the qualities"
"01;14;19;14","01;14;20;02","of the system"
"01;14;22;20","01;14;24;02","I think so."
"01;14;24;02","01;14;25;12","It's an interesting question."
"01;14;25;12","01;14;27;19","I would need to think about that"
"01;14;27;19","01;14;28;07","more carefully,"
"01;14;28;07","01;14;29;23","but my intuition is studied"
"01;14;29;23","01;14;32;13","that it changes the the way"
"01;14;33;11","01;14;35;29","you send face transitions in physics"
"01;14;37;02","01;14;38;07","and"
"01;14;38;27","01;14;41;18","I think that requires change"
"01;14;41;18","01;14;43;10","in formalism and again"
"01;14;43;10","01;14;45;15","requires important"
"01;14;45;15","01;14;47;05","what make an important difference"
"01;14;47;05","01;14;50;08","in your in your model with respect to to"
"01;14;50;09","01;14;51;05","how you modern face"
"01;14;51;05","01;14;53;08","transitions in physics."
"01;14;53;15","01;14;54;12","Thanks."
"01;14;54;22","01;14;55;06","I agree"
"01;14;55;06","01;14;56;12","something changes"
"01;14;56;12","01;14;57;22","and it's not for linear"
"01;14;57;22","01;14;58;19","time discussion"
"01;14;58;19","01;15;00;09","necessarily to unpack,"
"01;15;00;09","01;15;02;00","but these are the kinds of questions"
"01;15;02;00","01;15;03;02","that we're getting."
"01;15;03;02","01;15;04;23","Absolutely. So blue."
"01;15;04;23","01;15;07;03","Yes, yes, I think so."
"01;15;07;10","01;15;11;08","So I just want to reference the articles"
"01;15;11;08","01;15;12;18","that you posted in the chat."
"01;15;12;18","01;15;13;14","So the A,"
"01;15;13;14","01;15;14;21","I think they did say"
"01;15;14;21","01;15;15;22","dynamic equilibrium,"
"01;15;15;22","01;15;18;28","but like I like don't trust like op"
"01;15;18;28","01;15;20;10","ed science writers"
"01;15;20;10","01;15;23;12","to make correct quotations."
"01;15;24;02","01;15;25;24","And in the rancid paper"
"01;15;25;24","01;15;27;18","that was cited in your paper,"
"01;15;27;18","01;15;28;27","The Markov Blankets of Life,"
"01;15;28;27","01;15;30;16","it specifies that dynamic"
"01;15;30;16","01;15;32;20","equilibrium specifically is not"
"01;15;33;05","01;15;34;15","the state of homeostasis."
"01;15;34;15","01;15;35;11","It says"
"01;15;35;11","01;15;37;04","the very existence of living systems"
"01;15;37;04","01;15;38;11","can therefore be construed"
"01;15;38;11","01;15;40;24","as a process of boundary conservation,"
"01;15;41;02","01;15;42;13","where the boundary of a system"
"01;15;42;13","01;15;44;02","is its Markov blanket."
"01;15;44;02","01;15;46;06","That means that the dependencies induced"
"01;15;46;06","01;15;48;14","by the presence of a Markov blanket"
"01;15;48;14","01;15;49;07","are what keep"
"01;15;49;07","01;15;50;11","the system far"
"01;15;50;11","01;15;51;10","removed from"
"01;15;51;10","01;15;53;12","thermodynamically equilibrium,"
"01;15;53;12","01;15;54;14","not to be confused"
"01;15;54;14","01;15;56;11","with dynamic equilibrium"
"01;15;56;11","01;15;58;21","so I mean, specifically, like there"
"01;15;58;24","01;16;00;19","it's not dynamic equilibrium."
"01;16;00;19","01;16;01;11","It's it's"
"01;16;01;11","01;16;03;11","far from thermodynamic equilibrium."
"01;16;03;11","01;16;04;12","But but still,"
"01;16;04;12","01;16;05;12","dynamic equilibrium"
"01;16;05;12","01;16;06;26","is not not a part of that."
"01;16;06;26","01;16;08;08","And so that's why that reference"
"01;16;08;08","01;16;10;07","was very confusing to me."
"01;16;10;07","01;16;12;09","And like they on paper is like, yeah,"
"01;16;13;09","01;16;13;18","yeah."
"01;16;13;26","01;16;15;26","And we made, we made the same mistake"
"01;16;15;26","01;16;17;09","that he made without correcting."
"01;16;17;09","01;16;20;13","That's the way that Ramses can be."
"01;16;20;13","01;16;21;14","So I agree."
"01;16;21;14","01;16;23;12","We were talking loosely there"
"01;16;23;12","01;16;24;00","and we were"
"01;16;24;00","01;16;24;26","what we were having in"
"01;16;24;26","01;16;25;24","mind was the notion"
"01;16;25;24","01;16;27;23","of dynamical attractors."
"01;16;27;23","01;16;29;08","So that's why we found"
"01;16;29;08","01;16;30;27","a dynamic equilibrium very,"
"01;16;30;27","01;16;33;15","very like a nice term."
"01;16;33;15","01;16;35;15","But, but we might be talking"
"01;16;35;15","01;16;36;05","closely there."
"01;16;36;05","01;16;36;26","But as I said,"
"01;16;36;26","01;16;39;08","so that might be a mistake,"
"01;16;39;08","01;16;42;15","but not so much dependance"
"01;16;42;15","01;16;44;07","on that notion."
"01;16;44;07","01;16;44;22","Well, also"
"01;16;44;22","01;16;46;04","and the notion of attractor"
"01;16;46;04","01;16;49;06","in the, the, in the state of homeostasis"
"01;16;49;06","01;16;50;11","is specifically"
"01;16;50;11","01;16;52;14","a far from equilibrium, removes"
"01;16;52;28","01;16;55;01","the space that a biological system"
"01;16;55;01","01;16;55;21","exists in."
"01;16;55;21","01;16;57;25","And so it's just kind of"
"01;16;58;00","01;16;58;27","confusing to me."
"01;16;58;27","01;16;59;22","I thought"
"01;17;03;27","01;17;05;17","interesting,"
"01;17;05;24","01;17;08;13","you know, it's a challenge to say enough"
"01;17;08;25","01;17;10;07","to identify"
"01;17;11;08","01;17;11;25","what we're"
"01;17;11;25","01;17;12;23","talking about,"
"01;17;12;23","01;17;14;25","but especially when we're"
"01;17;14;25","01;17;18;01","crossing disciplinary boundaries"
"01;17;18;17","01;17;21;10","to know which"
"01;17;21;22","01;17;22;25","pieces of baggage"
"01;17;22;25","01;17;25;16","make it through one border or another,"
"01;17;25;23","01;17;28;27","like dynamical"
"01;17;29;17","01;17;32;03","could merely just mean involving time."
"01;17;32;03","01;17;34;21","But it also brings on a lot more meaning"
"01;17;34;21","01;17;36;22","in different areas."
"01;17;38;22","01;17;39;22","It's a great yeah."
"01;17;39;22","01;17;40;11","So we talk"
"01;17;40;11","01;17;41;09","we talk in the paper"
"01;17;41;09","01;17;44;08","about the possibility of"
"01;17;44;08","01;17;46;08","attractors like that change."
"01;17;46;08","01;17;46;14","Well,"
"01;17;46;14","01;17;48;03","we want to try to follow in another."
"01;17;48;03","01;17;50;21","So we understood that loosely"
"01;17;50;21","01;17;52;16","as a notion of dynamic equilibrium."
"01;17;52;16","01;17;53;16","But you're right"
"01;17;53;16","01;17;54;19","that using the term"
"01;17;54;19","01;17;57;05","rigorously probabilistic"
"01;17;58;13","01;18;01;12","let's turn in the sort of home"
"01;18;01;15","01;18;03;01","stretch of however long"
"01;18;03;01","01;18;05;00","we want to speak to the"
"01;18;05;00","01;18;07;28","short and concise conclusion"
"01;18;07;28","01;18;10;21","so you you in the last"
"01;18;10;21","01;18;11;23","paragraph brought up"
"01;18;11;23","01;18;13;29","this really interesting point"
"01;18;13;29","01;18;17;10","about the EP as a definition for"
"01;18;17;10","01;18;19;02","a system. And so"
"01;18;20;18","01;18;21;22","I wondered"
"01;18;22;00","01;18;24;12","what else could it be or might be?"
"01;18;24;12","01;18;26;13","What might we want"
"01;18;26;13","01;18;27;01","a framework"
"01;18;27;01","01;18;29;03","to be other than a definition"
"01;18;29;08","01;18;31;04","like what else"
"01;18;31;04","01;18;32;11","in the counterfactuals"
"01;18;32;11","01;18;33;22","of the way that this paragraph"
"01;18;33;22","01;18;35;01","could have been written,"
"01;18;35;01","01;18;36;15","what else could the FFP"
"01;18;36;15","01;18;37;09","or another framework"
"01;18;37;09","01;18;39;12","be other than a definition?"
"01;18;40;19","01;18;41;25","Is that synonymous"
"01;18;41;25","01;18;44;04","or complimentary with a description?"
"01;18;44;25","01;18;47;04","With what other pieces"
"01;18;47;04","01;18;49;03","come into play here?"
"01;18;50;13","01;18;51;26","Can you can you repeat the question?"
"01;18;51;26","01;18;53;15","I don't know if I understood it."
"01;18;53;15","01;18;55;15","If the FFP"
"01;18;56;03","01;18;57;08","is not a definition,"
"01;18;57;08","01;18;59;05","what else could it be?"
"01;18;59;28","01;19;01;23","Or other than a definition,"
"01;19;01;23","01;19;04;10","what do we want for a full"
"01;19;04;21","01;19;06;25","fledged principle?"
"01;19;06;25","01;19;07;06","Yeah,"
"01;19;08;12","01;19;09;17","what would make it a principle?"
"01;19;09;17","01;19;10;21","I think of"
"01;19;11;24","01;19;15;19","something that can be can explain life."
"01;19;15;24","01;19;18;19","I can explain"
"01;19;18;19","01;19;19;06","it. Yeah."
"01;19;19;06","01;19;20;29","Why, why? Why?"
"01;19;22;19","01;19;25;24","Biological systems"
"01;19;25;24","01;19;28;02","apparently violate the second law."
"01;19;28;02","01;19;31;03","Why do they stay in that far from"
"01;19;31;03","01;19;34;07","equilibrium, steady state?"
"01;19;34;07","01;19;35;22","I think"
"01;19;36;07","01;19;38;29","many defenders or advocates"
"01;19;38;29","01;19;42;02","of this of the principle understand"
"01;19;42;02","01;19;43;15","these sort of as a principle"
"01;19;43;15","01;19;45;20","that explain that has explanatory power,"
"01;19;46;06","01;19;48;08","that explain them"
"01;19;49;17","01;19;51;06","not only the existence,"
"01;19;51;06","01;19;53;16","even the existence of living system,"
"01;19;53;19","01;19;54;29","but especially why"
"01;19;54;29","01;19;57;28","those living systems stay"
"01;19;59;03","01;20;02;16","far from, from equilibrium"
"01;20;02;16","01;20;03;21","or from from Maxwell"
"01;20;03;21","01;20;06;15","Boltzmann equilibrium for a long time."
"01;20;06;15","01;20;09;00","We're not in a steady state"
"01;20;09;24","01;20;11;14","great point."
"01;20;11;14","01;20;15;25","So yeah, that's smart and explanation,"
"01;20;15;25","01;20;16;28","which of course goes"
"01;20;16;28","01;20;18;24","beyond or is complimentary"
"01;20;18;24","01;20;20;09","to definition."
"01;20;20;09","01;20;23;07","Explanation is one of the key"
"01;20;23;24","01;20;24;25","terms and themes"
"01;20;24;25","01;20;25;18","in the history"
"01;20;25;18","01;20;27;10","of the philosophy of science."
"01;20;27;10","01;20;30;11","And since an explanation is evaluated"
"01;20;31;03","01;20;33;15","subjectively or inter subjectively like"
"01;20;33;15","01;20;35;21","was that an adequate explanation?"
"01;20;35;21","01;20;36;09","That's a statement"
"01;20;36;09","01;20;37;06","about the relationship"
"01;20;37;06","01;20;38;01","between"
"01;20;38;06","01;20;41;04","a perceiver and the explanation itself."
"01;20;41;16","01;20;42;25","And so it"
"01;20;42;25","01;20;46;06","dumps the entire mass back into the lap"
"01;20;46;06","01;20;47;16","of almost a"
"01;20;47;16","01;20;49;09","psycho historical"
"01;20;49;09","01;20;51;06","perspective on science,"
"01;20;51;06","01;20;53;10","because good explanation"
"01;20;53;20","01;20;55;16","is about the inculturation"
"01;20;55;16","01;20;56;16","of the person"
"01;20;56;16","01;20;58;27","evaluating how good that explanation is."
"01;20;59;07","01;21;00;21","So Stephen Alden Blue"
"01;21;03;25","01;21;05;21","Yeah, I was just"
"01;21;05;21","01;21;06;20","looking up"
"01;21;06;20","01;21;10;02","regarding dynamical and dynamics."
"01;21;10;02","01;21;14;11","So dynamical the adjective means"
"01;21;14;18","01;21;17;10","relating to the study of dynamics."
"01;21;17;27","01;21;19;13","And so it says a dynamic"
"01;21;19;13","01;21;20;21","system is a system"
"01;21;20;21","01;21;22;24","exhibiting continual change."
"01;21;23;12","01;21;25;17","So dynamic system is continual change."
"01;21;25;17","01;21;27;25","A dynamical system is a system"
"01;21;28;20","01;21;31;08","related to the study of the dynamics"
"01;21;31;27","01;21;33;03","that dynamical system"
"01;21;33;03","01;21;35;18","is going to be a system working with"
"01;21;35;18","01;21;38;25","the dynamics of a system and"
"01;21;40;05","01;21;41;03","dynamic itself"
"01;21;41;03","01;21;42;14","just talks about the actual fact"
"01;21;42;14","01;21;44;08","that there's change happening."
"01;21;44;08","01;21;45;26","So that's kind of"
"01;21;46;14","01;21;47;11","that's kind of interesting"
"01;21;47;11","01;21;48;08","and be interesting as well."
"01;21;48;08","01;21;50;09","Whether you get dynamical things,"
"01;21;50;25","01;21;52;03","whether it has to be systems,"
"01;21;52;03","01;21;55;25","you know, like the, the, the, the,"
"01;21;55;29","01;21;57;28","the is there"
"01;21;57;28","01;21;59;07","in that maybe where there's"
"01;21;59;07","01;22;01;14","some sort of interest in a play between"
"01;22;03;03","01;22;04;27","three phase transitions as well."
"01;22;04;27","01;22;06;15","Like maybe there's some"
"01;22;06;15","01;22;07;25","there's a dynamic going on."
"01;22;07;25","01;22;08;20","Is there a dynamic"
"01;22;08;20","01;22;09;24","that is set"
"01;22;09;24","01;22;12;04","in order to reverse dynamic in some way?"
"01;22;12;04","01;22;14;11","So that that's kind of interesting."
"01;22;14;11","01;22;18;10","Yes, things in processes and static"
"01;22;18;27","01;22;20;00","versus dynamic."
"01;22;20;00","01;22;23;17","And then loose but acceptable"
"01;22;23;17","01;22;26;14","in many cases use of language."
"01;22;26;26","01;22;28;27","And again"
"01;22;28;27","01;22;32;27","the text modeling will be superlative"
"01;22;33;10","01;22;34;16","when we can establish"
"01;22;34;16","01;22;37;17","where these adjectives and nouns"
"01;22;37;17","01;22;40;20","and verbs are being used appropriately."
"01;22;40;20","01;22;43;00","Versus inappropriately"
"01;22;43;00","01;22;45;03","or at the very least suggesting"
"01;22;45;03","01;22;47;21","more precision or less precision than"
"01;22;48;27","01;22;50;03","warranted."
"01;22;50;05","01;22;51;13","So blue"
"01;22;53;07","01;22;54;24","oh, Dave has a great comment there."
"01;22;54;24","01;22;56;03","Historical"
"01;22;56;03","01;22;57;13","examined by historians"
"01;22;57;13","01;22;58;04","using founded"
"01;22;58;04","01;23;00;05","methods versus historic,"
"01;23;00;05","01;23;02;01","which is like about the event itself."
"01;23;02;01","01;23;03;16","Like it was a historic victory"
"01;23;03;16","01;23;04;13","or something like that."
"01;23;04;13","01;23;05;22","So it's"
"01;23;05;22","01;23;07;16","interesting how we give the disciplinary"
"01;23;07;16","01;23;10;19","nod with that Al on the adjective"
"01;23;14;02","01;23;15;13","I was just thinking about"
"01;23;15;13","01;23;16;08","the difference"
"01;23;16;08","01;23;17;05","like linguistically"
"01;23;17;05","01;23;19;06","between historic and historic."
"01;23;20;27","01;23;23;20","Like what might what might that be?"
"01;23;23;20","01;23;25;07","So my question"
"01;23;25;07","01;23;27;20","unrelated to historic sentence hysterics"
"01;23;28;17","01;23;31;12","really goes back to"
"01;23;31;12","01;23;32;16","what Patricia was saying"
"01;23;32;16","01;23;33;16","about the second lot"
"01;23;33;16","01;23;34;03","and touches"
"01;23;34;03","01;23;35;09","back to"
"01;23;35;09","01;23;37;16","what Stephen was saying earlier about"
"01;23;38;25","01;23;40;26","the the nonexistence"
"01;23;40;26","01;23;42;14","of negative entropy."
"01;23;42;14","01;23;43;28","And"
"01;23;44;08","01;23;46;24","I'm curious about that because I think,"
"01;23;47;25","01;23;51;09","you know, a lot of the steps"
"01;23;51;09","01;23;55;00","is is grounded in information dynamics"
"01;23;55;00","01;23;56;12","which depend"
"01;23;56;12","01;23;58;04","greatly on the existence"
"01;23;58;04","01;23;59;01","of negative entropy,"
"01;23;59;01","01;24;01;18","like the minimization of surprise"
"01;24;02;11","01;24;04;06","in the terms of information theory."
"01;24;04;06","01;24;06;27","So I was wondering if physics"
"01;24;06;27","01;24;08;25","and information theory are different."
"01;24;08;25","01;24;10;05","Are they one in the same"
"01;24;10;05","01;24;11;18","what are the differences?"
"01;24;11;18","01;24;13;12","How do we clarify them?"
"01;24;13;12","01;24;15;15","And similarly,"
"01;24;15;15","01;24;15;29","you know,"
"01;24;15;29","01;24;17;05","one of the claims in the paper"
"01;24;17;05","01;24;19;00","is to pay attention"
"01;24;19;00","01;24;20;08","to the differences between"
"01;24;20;08","01;24;21;12","physics and biology."
"01;24;21;12","01;24;22;19","And, you know,"
"01;24;22;19","01;24;23;08","I've always thought"
"01;24;23;08","01;24;25;00","that the laws of physics"
"01;24;25;00","01;24;28;22","are universally applicable, and perhaps"
"01;24;29;08","01;24;30;11","they're not. But but"
"01;24;31;19","01;24;32;24","I think that they should be."
"01;24;32;24","01;24;33;25","And, you know,"
"01;24;33;25","01;24;35;25","this defiance of the second law, like,"
"01;24;36;06","01;24;37;14","ah, do the laws of physics"
"01;24;37;14","01;24;38;29","not apply in biology"
"01;24;38;29","01;24;40;03","and biological systems?"
"01;24;40;03","01;24;43;11","And it's is it's negative entropy"
"01;24;43;11","01;24;45;05","that that biological systems do."
"01;24;45;05","01;24;46;01","I mean, Scott David"
"01;24;46;01","01;24;47;17","always classically refers"
"01;24;47;17","01;24;49;28","to the entropy secretion"
"01;24;49;28","01;24;52;04","of, you know, biological systems."
"01;24;52;04","01;24;53;29","And so I just was wondering"
"01;24;53;29","01;24;56;00","how do we reconcile these differences?"
"01;24;56;00","01;24;56;22","Maybe"
"01;24;56;29","01;24;59;19","because that's got great questions."
"01;24;59;19","01;25;00;16","Stephen, you want to go"
"01;25;00;16","01;25;02;11","on that topic or."
"01;25;02;11","01;25;03;21","Yeah, I think I think this is"
"01;25;03;21","01;25;04;15","really good."
"01;25;04;25","01;25;07;10","I think this is important because"
"01;25;07;10","01;25;08;09","you see"
"01;25;09;01","01;25;11;03","neg entropy kind of"
"01;25;11;12","01;25;12;24","is a bit like"
"01;25;12;25","01;25;14;16","a negative enthalpy"
"01;25;14;16","01;25;15;29","in the way it's formulated."
"01;25;15;29","01;25;18;21","I but the thing is,"
"01;25;18;21","01;25;21;25","you have a reduction only relative"
"01;25;22;23","01;25;24;26","to starting state"
"01;25;24;26","01;25;26;14","start in equilibrium state"
"01;25;26;14","01;25;27;20","in terms of entropy."
"01;25;27;20","01;25;29;15","It's it might have gone down"
"01;25;29;15","01;25;31;06","in terms of a start and state,"
"01;25;31;06","01;25;34;03","but it's not actually lower in an"
"01;25;35;08","01;25;35;22","energy"
"01;25;35;22","01;25;36;18","is energy right"
"01;25;36;18","01;25;38;28","you it can't be made can't be lost,"
"01;25;39;17","01;25;42;02","you know, but the entropy"
"01;25;42;26","01;25;45;04","you can have in variation in the entropy"
"01;25;45;04","01;25;47;02","and the variation can be noisy"
"01;25;47;02","01;25;47;22","going up and down."
"01;25;47;22","01;25;50;18","You can then extract information,"
"01;25;50;18","01;25;51;20","you can have things"
"01;25;51;20","01;25;53;17","which are more ordered."
"01;25;53;17","01;25;54;17","Now that's fair enough."
"01;25;54;17","01;25;57;16","You can have more order but neg entropy"
"01;25;58;23","01;26;01;00","isn't something which is"
"01;26;02;20","01;26;05;00","a value in that way."
"01;26;05;00","01;26;08;06","It's just a convenient piece of"
"01;26;09;24","01;26;11;20","temporary"
"01;26;12;21","01;26;14;11","mathematics"
"01;26;14;11","01;26;14;24","to help"
"01;26;14;24","01;26;16;28","see whether you're going to have a force"
"01;26;16;28","01;26;19;15","driving or reducing a reaction,"
"01;26;20;17","01;26;21;03","which."
"01;26;21;03","01;26;23;17","So that's where the challenge is"
"01;26;23;17","01;26;24;13","because it's"
"01;26;24;13","01;26;26;09","you're guessing it from the variations,"
"01;26;26;09","01;26;28;02","not from something"
"01;26;28;02","01;26;29;26","which is an equilibrium state."
"01;26;29;26","01;26;30;26","Because as soon as you say"
"01;26;30;26","01;26;31;28","neg entropy makes"
"01;26;31;28","01;26;32;25","it sound like it's"
"01;26;32;25","01;26;33;10","sitting there"
"01;26;33;10","01;26;35;10","with a particular amount of entropy"
"01;26;35;28","01;26;37;17","that makes sense"
"01;26;37;20","01;26;40;06","and it's not really like that."
"01;26;40;06","01;26;40;29","So this, this is,"
"01;26;40;29","01;26;42;09","this is like one of the kind of"
"01;26;43;16","01;26;45;16","misplaced misunderstandings"
"01;26;45;16","01;26;49;09","I think it rounds entropy"
"01;26;50;00","01;26;51;26","OK, interesting."
"01;26;51;26","01;26;54;09","One other view blue on your question"
"01;26;54;09","01;26;56;19","about information and thermodynamics."
"01;26;58;00","01;27;00;23","We have some very slam dunk"
"01;27;01;06","01;27;03;29","info, thermo synthesis"
"01;27;04;20","01;27;06;15","on the processor scale,"
"01;27;06;15","01;27;09;18","like the amount of heat that is emitted"
"01;27;09;18","01;27;10;20","or absorbed"
"01;27;10;20","01;27;14;06","by certain very, very granular atomic"
"01;27;14;22","01;27;16;09","in multiple senses,"
"01;27;16;09","01;27;18;17","informational transitions"
"01;27;18;17","01;27;20;13","and so it's almost like"
"01;27;20;13","01;27;22;12","that's like the, the stem"
"01;27;22;12","01;27;23;03","and there's that."
"01;27;23;03","01;27;25;12","We know that there is a connection there"
"01;27;26;16","01;27;28;21","either as if"
"01;27;29;07","01;27;31;26","to be sure, if not in actuality."
"01;27;32;03","01;27;34;05","So map and territory information"
"01;27;34;05","01;27;35;11","thermodynamics potentially"
"01;27;35;11","01;27;36;18","coming together"
"01;27;36;18","01;27;39;25","and part of our curiosity and drive"
"01;27;39;25","01;27;41;14","with active inference"
"01;27;41;14","01;27;44;01","is whether info dynamics"
"01;27;44;25","01;27;45;24","might apply"
"01;27;45;24","01;27;47;29","to higher orders of organization"
"01;27;48;20","01;27;49;25","and whether we can use"
"01;27;49;25","01;27;51;26","some of these models and ideas"
"01;27;51;26","01;27;53;03","to describe"
"01;27;53;03","01;27;56;02","informational patterns and thermodynamic"
"01;27;56;13","01;27;58;14","eventually even bioenergy stick"
"01;27;59;10","01;28;00;17","patterns and phenomena"
"01;28;01;19","01;28;03;17","beyond the CPU."
"01;28;03;17","01;28;06;10","And that's where it's going to be."
"01;28;06;10","01;28;08;28","This question of OK, maybe we generalize"
"01;28;09;26","01;28;12;02","and it's useful, but"
"01;28;12;02","01;28;15;16","we've lost some reality touch."
"01;28;15;23","01;28;17;24","So the parameter"
"01;28;17;24","01;28;19;19","a temperature parameter on decision"
"01;28;19;19","01;28;21;07","making doesn't refer"
"01;28;21;07","01;28;24;15","to the thermometer reading of the brain."
"01;28;25;08","01;28;28;14","I think we're OK with that so in a way,"
"01;28;28;14","01;28;30;02","we are lifting"
"01;28;30;02","01;28;32;07","away from the physical grounding"
"01;28;32;07","01;28;33;27","because we're using terms"
"01;28;33;27","01;28;35;12","like temperature"
"01;28;35;12","01;28;36;14","entropy"
"01;28;36;14","01;28;37;15","in their information"
"01;28;37;15","01;28;39;23","and not their physical capacity."
"01;28;40;21","01;28;42;00","And as the"
"01;28;42;00","01;28;44;08","key questions raised in this paper"
"01;28;45;16","01;28;48;14","brought to this discussion,"
"01;28;48;14","01;28;50;18","there are opportunities and challenges"
"01;28;50;18","01;28;51;23","with making those kinds"
"01;28;51;23","01;28;52;27","of generalizations."
"01;28;52;27","01;28;55;14","It's not just a simple win,"
"01;28;55;14","01;28;58;16","it's things are gained, things are lost."
"01;28;58;16","01;29;00;18","Some things come into resolution,"
"01;29;00;18","01;29;01;11","other things"
"01;29;01;11","01;29;03;28","become incapable of being resolved."
"01;29;04;16","01;29;05;26","So that's like the"
"01;29;05;26","01;29;08;01","some of the excellent questions"
"01;29;08;01","01;29;10;00","that I think the paper"
"01;29;10;00","01;29;11;20","brings to the table."
"01;29;11;20","01;29;14;11","And it combines those questions"
"01;29;14;27","01;29;15;27","along with just"
"01;29;17;08","01;29;20;17","tantalizingly a look at the history"
"01;29;21;05","01;29;23;22","and the development of active inference"
"01;29;23;22","01;29;25;05","as a framework."
"01;29;25;05","01;29;27;20","And so we can be clear about"
"01;29;27;29","01;29;30;03","which papers said what, when,"
"01;29;30;23","01;29;32;08","and then where are we headed,"
"01;29;32;08","01;29;34;08","what would be our preferences"
"01;29;34;08","01;29;37;10","for a thermodynamic model"
"01;29;37;10","01;29;38;20","of decision making?"
"01;29;38;20","01;29;40;05","Will we only succeed"
"01;29;40;05","01;29;40;18","when it's"
"01;29;40;18","01;29;43;27","about the temperature of the brain?"
"01;29;44;01","01;29;45;26","It might be for some person."
"01;29;45;26","01;29;48;05","However, other people might just say"
"01;29;48;05","01;29;49;08","if there is a temperature"
"01;29;49;08","01;29;50;26","like parameter in the sense"
"01;29;50;26","01;29;52;26","that that parameters formalism"
"01;29;52;26","01;29;55;29","looks like temperature of water"
"01;29;56;11","01;29;57;18","in a test tube,"
"01;29;57;18","01;29;59;11","then we have something"
"01;29;59;11","01;30;01;19","that's already useful and interesting"
"01;30;02;04","01;30;04;29","and that's where"
"01;30;04;29","01;30;06;21","the train ends for me."
"01;30;06;21","01;30;08;23","And then somebody else may continue"
"01;30;08;23","01;30;10;28","to build the rails off"
"01;30;11;06","01;30;12;05","towards wondering"
"01;30;12;05","01;30;14;23","whether is it metaphysically"
"01;30;15;04","01;30;16;18","a temperature of decision making,"
"01;30;16;18","01;30;18;12","all these other areas that people"
"01;30;18;12","01;30;18;28","can take it."
"01;30;20;16","01;30;21;13","And so"
"01;30;21;25","01;30;22;18","it's the trade off"
"01;30;22;18","01;30;23;17","between realism"
"01;30;23;17","01;30;24;25","for generality"
"01;30;24;25","01;30;27;04","and utility that we've come to these"
"01;30;28;03","01;30;30;11","meta modeling discussions before"
"01;30;30;26","01;30;34;01","in number 14 and beyond"
"01;30;35;17","01;30;36;10","OK,"
"01;30;39;00","01;30;41;08","anyone wants to ask a question"
"01;30;41;08","01;30;43;22","in the chat or raise their hand here."
"01;30;44;10","01;30;47;00","Otherwise, let's see back to our dot one"
"01;30;47;18","01;30;48;05","questions"
"01;30;48;05","01;30;49;18","and see if there's any threads"
"01;30;49;18","01;30;53;05","from dot one that we want to just"
"01;30;54;01","01;30;54;25","recap or see"
"01;30;54;25","01;30;57;08","if we have a different perspective on"
"01;30;57;08","01;30;59;08","and then we can just sort of"
"01;31;00;11","01;31;04;15","close the dot two and jump off into"
"01;31;06;11","01;31;07;09","the next steps."
"01;31;07;09","01;31;09;10","So in one,"
"01;31;11;05","01;31;13;14","we started with some questions again"
"01;31;13;14","01;31;16;17","from the more history of FFP and active"
"01;31;17;13","01;31;20;27","about in what ways has physics"
"01;31;21;08","01;31;25;02","been used to investigate the FFP?"
"01;31;25;14","01;31;26;14","We talked a little bit"
"01;31;26;14","01;31;30;28","about how the cost of paper that was 26"
"01;31;31;10","01;31;32;04","B.C mechanics"
"01;31;32;04","01;31;33;25","for stationary processes"
"01;31;33;25","01;31;35;06","relates to the city"
"01;31;35;06","01;31;37;26","stationary discussion or not."
"01;31;37;26","01;31;38;09","We'll see"
"01;31;41;07","01;31;42;25","we talked about then and also"
"01;31;42;25","01;31;43;09","a little bit"
"01;31;43;09","01;31;46;19","today, is the FFP a theory of life?"
"01;31;46;22","01;31;48;12","Well, in the conclusion"
"01;31;48;12","01;31;50;08","it was said to be a definition"
"01;31;50;08","01;31;51;18","and we talked about some other things."
"01;31;51;18","01;31;53;14","It could be blue"
"01;31;56;26","01;31;58;04","so I still have to unmute."
"01;31;58;04","01;31;59;11","You'd think I would learn"
"01;31;59;11","01;32;00;21","after all this time."
"01;32;00;21","01;32;01;07","Never learned."
"01;32;01;07","01;32;02;11","Don't change"
"01;32;03;18","01;32;05;09","the the urgency thing."
"01;32;05;09","01;32;05;21","I think"
"01;32;05;21","01;32;08;25","maybe you guys discuss that before"
"01;32;08;25","01;32;09;15","I got here."
"01;32;09;15","01;32;11;11","But, but I think like one of the,"
"01;32;11;11","01;32;14;00","the points that was made in this paper"
"01;32;14;00","01;32;15;17","addressing the ERG, the city"
"01;32;15;17","01;32;17;29","and the fact that"
"01;32;18;24","01;32;21;00","you know, biological systems are"
"01;32;21;10","01;32;23;00","I mean, I don't think I can"
"01;32;23;00","01;32;23;14","I don't think"
"01;32;23;14","01;32;24;12","biological systems"
"01;32;24;12","01;32;26;05","can be described as as ergodic."
"01;32;26;05","01;32;27;11","And this is a discussion"
"01;32;27;11","01;32;29;14","that Daniel and I have had many times."
"01;32;30;05","01;32;30;24","I mean, sure."
"01;32;30;24","01;32;34;28","Within a very restricted space, like,"
"01;32;34;28","01;32;35;26","you know, by body"
"01;32;35;26","01;32;37;08","temperature, for example,"
"01;32;37;08","01;32;38;24","in the range from I mean,"
"01;32;38;24","01;32;40;21","can I survive like 105"
"01;32;40;21","01;32;41;24","Fahrenheit probably"
"01;32;41;24","01;32;44;18","and you know, maybe 95 Fahrenheit."
"01;32;44;18","01;32;46;02","So I have like this ten degree range."
"01;32;46;02","01;32;46;20","And I'm sure"
"01;32;46;20","01;32;48;10","at some point in my lifetime"
"01;32;48;10","01;32;49;15","I will visit all the space"
"01;32;49;15","01;32;50;28","within that range"
"01;32;50;28","01;32;52;08","because you can't skip over"
"01;32;52;08","01;32;55;15","you don't go from 96 to 100 and skip"
"01;32;55;15","01;32;56;26","any of the points in between."
"01;32;56;26","01;32;57;24","So like, you know,"
"01;32;57;24","01;32;59;27","it's incrementally like of course"
"01;32;59;27","01;33;02;07","a visit, all of that space."
"01;33;02;07","01;33;04;06","And so I do think that, that,"
"01;33;04;06","01;33;05;12","that's an important question."
"01;33;05;12","01;33;06;23","But yeah, that,"
"01;33;06;23","01;33;08;13","that was really"
"01;33;08;13","01;33;12;00","addressed by Acosta in that 26"
"01;33;12;13","01;33;15;06","livestream about, you know,"
"01;33;16;00","01;33;19;22","homeostasis is a quasi stationary"
"01;33;19;22","01;33;21;06","because it's not perfectly stationary."
"01;33;21;06","01;33;21;13","Right."
"01;33;21;13","01;33;22;19","It's like a,"
"01;33;22;19","01;33;25;02","it's a squishy stationary, but it's not,"
"01;33;25;11","01;33;25;19","you know,"
"01;33;25;19","01;33;26;03","it doesn't,"
"01;33;26;03","01;33;26;24","it doesn't sample"
"01;33;26;24","01;33;28;04","the entire we don't sample"
"01;33;28;04","01;33;29;24","the entire state space of"
"01;33;29;24","01;33;30;18","say temperature,"
"01;33;31;18","01;33;32;28","you know, as a biological"
"01;33;32;28","01;33;33;09","system"
"01;33;33;09","01;33;33;29","that must maintain"
"01;33;33;29","01;33;34;23","a certain temperature."
"01;33;34;23","01;33;36;20","So I think that that was resolved"
"01;33;36;20","01;33;38;12","but did you guys discuss that before"
"01;33;38;12","01;33;39;22","I got here?"
"01;33;41;08","01;33;43;23","Not the bounded ness per se,"
"01;33;44;25","01;33;45;15","but"
"01;33;46;12","01;33;49;20","potentially some relevant pieces"
"01;33;49;20","01;33;52;25","about the city and stationary."
"01;33;52;28","01;33;54;07","Yeah. So may I say something?"
"01;33;54;07","01;33;55;02","Sorry that"
"01;33;55;07","01;33;56;19","I had to turn off the video"
"01;33;56;19","01;33;58;11","am with my baby here."
"01;33;58;11","01;33;59;23","Hello, baby."
"01;34;01;01","01;34;03;07","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"01;34;03;08","01;34;05;10","So we didn't we? I agree with you."
"01;34;05;10","01;34;06;27","I think that's one of the things"
"01;34;06;27","01;34;09;04","that we that we discussed in the paper."
"01;34;09;08","01;34;10;20","So it's very problematic"
"01;34;10;20","01;34;11;11","to understand"
"01;34;11;11","01;34;13;14","biological systems such as body systems."
"01;34;14;27","01;34;17;19","But in the discussion last week"
"01;34;17;19","01;34;19;22","you were saying or Maxwell was saying"
"01;34;19;22","01;34;21;15","that new formulations"
"01;34;21;15","01;34;22;07","of the free energy"
"01;34;22;07","01;34;24;04","principles don't rely"
"01;34;24;04","01;34;25;01","on that assumptions"
"01;34;25;01","01;34;26;01","that they dropped"
"01;34;26;01","01;34;26;24","that assumption"
"01;34;26;24","01;34;27;24","in the new formulations"
"01;34;27;24","01;34;29;15","of the free energy principle"
"01;34;29;15","01;34;31;27","and what I was saying before today"
"01;34;31;27","01;34;32;21","is that"
"01;34;32;21","01;34;34;09","it's still in new formulations"
"01;34;34;09","01;34;36;05","of the free energy principle."
"01;34;36;05","01;34;38;12","They rely on the existence"
"01;34;38;12","01;34;39;25","of weakly mixing random"
"01;34;39;25","01;34;40;28","dynamical systems,"
"01;34;40;28","01;34;42;07","and to my understanding,"
"01;34;42;07","01;34;43;23","mixing systems required"
"01;34;43;23","01;34;45;01","implicitly anyhow."
"01;34;45;01","01;34;46;29","So it's not clear"
"01;34;46;29","01;34;48;22","that they have really dropped"
"01;34;48;22","01;34;50;18","the assumption in the new formulations."
"01;34;50;18","01;34;52;22","And if so, I would like to see"
"01;34;52;22","01;34;54;20","exactly how this framework will work"
"01;34;54;20","01;34;56;26","without the assumption of implicitly."
"01;34;56;26","01;34;58;11","I haven't seen that explicitly."
"01;34;58;11","01;35;00;03","I, I my believe that"
"01;35;00;03","01;35;01;14","that can be done, but I would like"
"01;35;01;14","01;35;02;13","to, to cede"
"01;35;05;07","01;35;05;29","and"
"01;35;06;05","01;35;07;17","we don't evade requirements"
"01;35;07;17","01;35;09;10","just by not mentioning them."
"01;35;09;10","01;35;11;19","So it's about what papers do"
"01;35;11;20","01;35;13;07","mention as well as reading"
"01;35;13;07","01;35;14;02","between the lines"
"01;35;14;02","01;35;15;07","between the formalisms,"
"01;35;15;07","01;35;16;24","between the citations"
"01;35;16;24","01;35;18;29","to really what is the bedrock"
"01;35;19;19","01;35;21;08","or tautology"
"01;35;21;08","01;35;23;00","that the theories rest upon."
"01;35;23;00","01;35;23;22","Stephen"
"01;35;25;03","01;35;25;09","You"
"01;35;26;09","01;35;26;10","know,"
"01;35;26;11","01;35;28;23","I think this also might point to your"
"01;35;28;23","01;35;31;08","cybernetics point, Daniel, and"
"01;35;31;08","01;35;34;05","in the sense of, you know, where"
"01;35;34;05","01;35;36;02","does something happen,"
"01;35;36;02","01;35;38;27","this kind of early uptake"
"01;35;39;19","01;35;41;14","process of mixed in"
"01;35;41;14","01;35;43;25","and where may happen through a"
"01;35;44;13","01;35;45;26","higher level"
"01;35;45;26","01;35;47;13","cybernetic mechanism"
"01;35;47;13","01;35;49;16","that the organism has"
"01;35;49;18","01;35;52;29","that is enabled by"
"01;35;54;00","01;35;56;14","sort of ergodic"
"01;35;56;14","01;35;58;28","act of inference or whatever processes"
"01;35;59;15","01;36;01;25","are emergent."
"01;36;01;25","01;36;03;05","But the fact that it's emerged"
"01;36;03;05","01;36;05;19","from ergodic processes"
"01;36;05;19","01;36;06;21","at multiple nested"
"01;36;06;21","01;36;07;10","levels doesn't"
"01;36;07;10","01;36;08;05","necessarily mean"
"01;36;08;05","01;36;09;27","that some of the high level"
"01;36;09;27","01;36;12;27","ways of keeping something within bounds"
"01;36;13;18","01;36;15;26","then has to follow that"
"01;36;16;24","01;36;17;15","because,"
"01;36;17;22","01;36;20;13","you know, you can create a system"
"01;36;20;13","01;36;22;22","out of all the cells"
"01;36;22;22","01;36;25;04","that are doing their thing, so to speak."
"01;36;25;21","01;36;27;10","They'll be in their thing."
"01;36;27;10","01;36;30;29","So we we this is where it can maybe"
"01;36;33;14","01;36;33;24","be that"
"01;36;33;24","01;36;34;20","danger that"
"01;36;34;20","01;36;35;20","yeah, there's an"
"01;36;35;20","01;36;37;09","extension of a certain process."
"01;36;37;09","01;36;37;17","It's like,"
"01;36;37;17","01;36;39;16","OK, where does something"
"01;36;39;16","01;36;42;26","which is relying on ergodic processes"
"01;36;44;04","01;36;47;00","or some other approaches"
"01;36;47;21","01;36;50;20","able to give way to"
"01;36;50;20","01;36;53;13","another type of"
"01;36;54;01","01;36;55;23","control theory?"
"01;36;56;27","01;36;57;17","Yes."
"01;36;57;17","01;37;00;16","And over short time horizons, is it"
"01;37;00;16","01;37;02;02","possible to have sensory"
"01;37;02;02","01;37;03;24","motor loops that work,"
"01;37;03;24","01;37;06;23","whether or not some infinite case"
"01;37;08;10","01;37;09;14","is what it rests upon?"
"01;37;09;14","01;37;10;03","Blue"
"01;37;11;25","01;37;12;27","So Patricia,"
"01;37;12;27","01;37;14;22","I'm curious to know"
"01;37;14;22","01;37;16;15","or to know what you think about"
"01;37;16;15","01;37;18;12","if you've read the de Costa Paper"
"01;37;18;12","01;37;21;18","about Bayesian, Bayesian theory"
"01;37;21;18","01;37;22;29","processes for"
"01;37;23;01","01;37;23;24","Bayesian forces,"
"01;37;23;24","01;37;24;19","Bayesian mechanics"
"01;37;24;19","01;37;27;09","for stationary passes. Vega"
"01;37;27;09","01;37;28;14","So I'm curious to know"
"01;37;28;14","01;37;29;02","if you've read that"
"01;37;29;02","01;37;29;28","and what you felt"
"01;37;29;28","01;37;31;16","was perhaps lacking"
"01;37;31;16","01;37;35;02","from that mathematical description"
"01;37;35;11","01;37;39;14","to meet the requirements that you were"
"01;37;39;14","01;37;42;16","referring to for mixing systems and"
"01;37;42;25","01;37;43;08","a city"
"01;37;48;00","01;37;48;11","yeah."
"01;37;48;11","01;37;48;25","Thank you."
"01;37;48;25","01;37;50;22","I did look at that,"
"01;37;50;22","01;37;52;16","but we explicitly wanted"
"01;37;52;16","01;37;54;03","to focus on other assumptions,"
"01;37;54;03","01;37;55;08","not on the Bayesian"
"01;37;55;08","01;37;56;16","assumptions of the paper."
"01;37;56;16","01;37;58;06","We didn't also mention"
"01;37;58;06","01;37;58;23","the Markov"
"01;37;58;23","01;37;59;22","blanket assumption,"
"01;37;59;22","01;38;00;13","which is, quote,"
"01;38;00;13","01;38;01;06","a core assumption"
"01;38;01;06","01;38;02;27","in the free energy principle."
"01;38;02;27","01;38;05;10","And we left that out deliberately."
"01;38;05;10","01;38;06;29","First of all, because of lack of space,"
"01;38;06;29","01;38;08;16","the paper is long enough."
"01;38;08;16","01;38;08;29","Second,"
"01;38;08;29","01;38;10;20","because there is much more literature"
"01;38;10;20","01;38;11;01","on that"
"01;38;11;01","01;38;12;20","than on these other assumptions"
"01;38;12;20","01;38;14;26","that we discuss in our paper."
"01;38;14;26","01;38;16;28","So I think this formulation of,"
"01;38;17;13","01;38;17;21","well,"
"01;38;17;21","01;38;18;19","I don't"
"01;38;18;19","01;38;20;07","have that paper on the top of my head,"
"01;38;20;07","01;38;22;13","but I think they, again,"
"01;38;23;09","01;38;26;20","rely on weakly mixing dynamical systems"
"01;38;26;20","01;38;28;12","in the paper. Right."
"01;38;28;27","01;38;30;05","They don't"
"01;38;30;24","01;38;32;09","we can check they"
"01;38;32;09","01;38;34;22","they use that framework"
"01;38;34;22","01;38;36;03","so I think to the extent"
"01;38;36;03","01;38;37;04","that they use that framework,"
"01;38;37;04","01;38;38;04","if I'm not mistaken,"
"01;38;38;04","01;38;40;05","then the same criticisms applied."
"01;38;40;23","01;38;42;24","You need to apply in faith basis"
"01;38;42;24","01;38;43;28","and you need the existence"
"01;38;43;28","01;38;45;07","of attractive or at least"
"01;38;49;18","01;38;50;14","cool"
"01;38;51;28","01;38;53;03","I just imagined, like"
"01;38;53;03","01;38;56;12","these networks of citations, like a,"
"01;38;57;19","01;38;59;29","some sort of biological metaphor,"
"01;39;00;02","01;39;01;10","some swarm of citations"
"01;39;01;10","01;39;03;02","with words being traced"
"01;39;03;02","01;39;03;18","between them"
"01;39;03;18","01;39;04;25","and connections of the words."
"01;39;04;25","01;39;05;20","And"
"01;39;07;00","01;39;10;13","I think we're in the boutique artisan,"
"01;39;10;13","01;39;11;07","the farmer's market"
"01;39;11;07","01;39;13;27","phase of these kinds of analyzes."
"01;39;14;07","01;39;15;01","And there"
"01;39;15;01","01;39;17;01","there will be a time not so far away"
"01;39;17;12","01;39;19;05","when these questions"
"01;39;19;05","01;39;21;23","can be resolved better blue"
"01;39;23;14","01;39;24;08","so yeah,"
"01;39;24;08","01;39;26;08","just like the paper aside,"
"01;39;26;08","01;39;26;15","I mean,"
"01;39;26;15","01;39;28;07","I definitely realize that there's space"
"01;39;28;07","01;39;29;24","constraints and also like,"
"01;39;29;24","01;39;32;03","what was the timing of your paper versus"
"01;39;32;03","01;39;33;04","the cost of paper?"
"01;39;33;04","01;39;35;00","And did you have time to, like,"
"01;39;35;00","01;39;36;11","incorporate all of those"
"01;39;36;11","01;39;39;09","the new, like, updated"
"01;39;39;09","01;39;41;19","version of the math so"
"01;39;42;10","01;39;45;07","there's not weekly mixing or mixing"
"01;39;45;16","01;39;47;00","mentioned in the cost of paper."
"01;39;47;00","01;39;49;03","And so I really just would be curious,"
"01;39;49;03","01;39;51;20","maybe you want to follow up via email"
"01;39;51;20","01;39;55;15","to to know what what was missing from"
"01;39;55;15","01;39;57;17","that that formulation"
"01;39;57;17","01;39;58;20","and in your mind,"
"01;39;58;20","01;40;00;23","for it to be plausible?"
"01;40;00;23","01;40;01;19","Because for me, too,"
"01;40;01;19","01;40;03;06","it was very"
"01;40;03;08","01;40;05;19","like the foundation of the FCP"
"01;40;05;27","01;40;07;19","existing in"
"01;40;07;19","01;40;08;29","in regard to city"
"01;40;08;29","01;40;09;25","or requiring"
"01;40;09;25","01;40;10;23","or the city"
"01;40;10;23","01;40;13;13","for applicability was very jarring."
"01;40;13;20","01;40;14;16","Like I felt like"
"01;40;14;16","01;40;15;21","that's, that can't be right."
"01;40;16;21","01;40;18;19","But I felt that it"
"01;40;18;19","01;40;19;17","was really resolved"
"01;40;19;17","01;40;20;28","by the cost of paper."
"01;40;20;28","01;40;24;15","And so I'm curious if you don't feel"
"01;40;24;15","01;40;25;24","the same way,"
"01;40;25;24","01;40;27;27","what your hesitation would be."
"01;40;27;27","01;40;29;06","So maybe we want to follow up"
"01;40;29;06","01;40;31;11","and at some point."
"01;40;32;05","01;40;33;01","Yeah, maybe."
"01;40;33;01","01;40;34;11","Or maybe by email."
"01;40;34;11","01;40;37;07","So I would definitely look at this paper"
"01;40;37;07","01;40;38;08","and other new research"
"01;40;38;08","01;40;39;04","because that was published"
"01;40;39;04","01;40;40;23","this year, right?"
"01;40;40;23","01;40;42;13","It's very recent."
"01;40;42;13","01;40;45;00","So the papers that we were focusing"
"01;40;45;00","01;40;45;12","a little bit"
"01;40;45;12","01;40;46;23","more on in the, in"
"01;40;46;23","01;40;48;17","our baby was part of it."
"01;40;48;17","01;40;51;26","Which is also very new and present 2019."
"01;40;51;26","01;40;52;17","This put"
"01;40;52;17","01;40;54;05","this free energy principle"
"01;40;54;05","01;40;56;08","for particle physics"
"01;40;56;17","01;40;59;10","and the other papers we look at them"
"01;40;59;21","01;41;00;23","very briefly"
"01;41;00;23","01;41;02;25","because they were actually out"
"01;41;02;25","01;41;04;20","after our paper was accepted"
"01;41;04;20","01;41;06;11","or maybe during the review process."
"01;41;06;11","01;41;08;02","So it wasn't part"
"01;41;08;02","01;41;10;01","of our research systematic research"
"01;41;10;01","01;41;12;03","but we did take a look at them."
"01;41;13;08","01;41;14;03","I think we may"
"01;41;14;03","01;41;17;09","have even caught that paper but yeah."
"01;41;17;09","01;41;19;21","So I would like to take a look at that."
"01;41;19;21","01;41;22;23","Again, I'm not sure whether they use"
"01;41;22;23","01;41;23;11","if they use"
"01;41;23;11","01;41;24;26","the notion of information geometry,"
"01;41;24;26","01;41;26;16","then they're probably also"
"01;41;26;16","01;41;28;14","relying on weekly dynamical systems."
"01;41;28;14","01;41;31;28","But I would have to look at that again"
"01;41;31;28","01;41;35;15","so we can continue the conversation by"
"01;41;37;03","01;41;39;20","counterfactual paper spaces."
"01;41;39;24","01;41;40;07","You know,"
"01;41;40;07","01;41;41;26","you have some sort of clause"
"01;41;41;26","01;41;43;17","that gets triggered"
"01;41;43;17","01;41;44;23","if something happens"
"01;41;44;23","01;41;45;16","in the literature"
"01;41;45;16","01;41;48;11","then this paragraph should be deleted,"
"01;41;48;26","01;41;50;28","like pending a future word on this."
"01;41;50;28","01;41;53;01","This could be deleted"
"01;41;54;00","01;41;56;20","in the last little bit."
"01;41;56;20","01;42;00;03","Maybe we can just have any thoughts."
"01;42;00;19","01;42;04;02","Just why does this whole"
"01;42;04;02","01;42;05;10","discussion matter"
"01;42;05;10","01;42;07;27","for the FSP and for active?"
"01;42;08;10","01;42;11;07","Well, the validity and the adequacy"
"01;42;11;21","01;42;12;17","were how"
"01;42;12;17","01;42;15;03","it was described by this paper, why"
"01;42;15;20","01;42;17;03","it it matters."
"01;42;17;03","01;42;19;23","So it's kind of cool because often"
"01;42;20;08","01;42;22;04","the citations that we discuss,"
"01;42;22;04","01;42;24;23","they don't always lay out on the table"
"01;42;24;23","01;42;27;23","why it matters to understand this topic."
"01;42;28;16","01;42;31;11","And I think we got that very"
"01;42;31;21","01;42;33;25","clearly from this work."
"01;42;34;02","01;42;36;00","So I really appreciate that."
"01;42;36;00","01;42;38;05","And it also laid out"
"01;42;38;05","01;42;40;09","many of the next steps directly,"
"01;42;40;14","01;42;42;26","not every next step, but"
"01;42;42;26","01;42;44;27","the specific key"
"01;42;44;27","01;42;48;01","themes and challenges are addressed."
"01;42;48;01","01;42;50;27","And if there is a obvious or non"
"01;42;50;27","01;42;52;17","obvious response"
"01;42;52;17","01;42;54;17","that'll be a citation that somebody can"
"01;42;54;18","01;42;56;13","swoop on. Stephen"
"01;42;59;04","01;43;01;18","Yeah, I think it's important"
"01;43;01;18","01;43;06;03","because we are seeing a lot of interest"
"01;43;06;15","01;43;08;16","and a huge amount of interest"
"01;43;08;24","01;43;09;20","in activism"
"01;43;09;20","01;43;12;18","and embodied work and physicality"
"01;43;12;23","01;43;15;14","and how these things can shape up"
"01;43;15;14","01;43;17;17","and therefore"
"01;43;17;23","01;43;21;07","your mathematical arguments"
"01;43;22;07","01;43;24;09","will limit things."
"01;43;24;09","01;43;26;11","I think getting into the nitty gritty"
"01;43;26;11","01;43;27;16","of the physics,"
"01;43;27;16","01;43;29;01","which in itself"
"01;43;29;01","01;43;31;13","is best in with some of this"
"01;43;31;13","01;43;31;24","because it's"
"01;43;31;24","01;43;33;14","kind of cutting edge for them"
"01;43;33;14","01;43;34;04","in terms of"
"01;43;34;04","01;43;35;21","that is really important"
"01;43;35;21","01;43;36;02","I think,"
"01;43;36;02","01;43;38;08","because you see some of the criticisms"
"01;43;38;08","01;43;40;17","coming around in activism"
"01;43;41;07","01;43;43;04","and trying to get arrested on things."
"01;43;43;04","01;43;45;06","And I do think I will say that I think"
"01;43;45;26","01;43;49;26","maybe sometimes saying go visit the map,"
"01;43;50;16","01;43;52;20","which is ultimately based in this city,"
"01;43;52;20","01;43;54;24","which is basically a physics principle"
"01;43;54;24","01;43;57;21","as much as a math principle in terms of"
"01;43;57;21","01;43;59;20","how that comes to be present"
"01;44;01;07","01;44;01;25","comes up."
"01;44;01;25","01;44;02;22","So I think this is"
"01;44;02;22","01;44;04;27","this is a really important"
"01;44;06;01","01;44;08;11","area that physics and"
"01;44;09;29","01;44;10;29","and maybe the so"
"01;44;10;29","01;44;12;22","at the areas of applied physics"
"01;44;12;22","01;44;18;19","start to come into yes."
"01;44;19;00","01;44;20;07","And we'll just send them"
"01;44;20;07","01;44;20;28","on the run around."
"01;44;20;28","01;44;21;29","OK, go to the math"
"01;44;21;29","01;44;22;27","and I'll go to the physics."
"01;44;22;27","01;44;24;29","OK, now to the philosophers."
"01;44;24;29","01;44;25;13","You go"
"01;44;25;13","01;44;26;11","and then"
"01;44;26;11","01;44;27;18","back to another"
"01;44;27;18","01;44;30;03","maybe non academic department."
"01;44;30;03","01;44;31;25","Is that run around the answer?"
"01;44;31;25","01;44;33;01","What if there is a station"
"01;44;33;01","01;44;36;05","charity in the run around"
"01;44;36;09","01;44;36;25","but"
"01;44;37;25","01;44;40;29","very good points"
"01;44;42;07","01;44;42;24","it's kind of fun"
"01;44;42;24","01;44;45;03","because we've had these questions"
"01;44;45;03","01;44;47;04","for a long time, if not"
"01;44;48;14","01;44;50;25","the longest time yet."
"01;44;51;13","01;44;54;21","Many of them were explicitly addressed"
"01;44;54;21","01;44;58;04","by this paper and by the 31 discussions"
"01;45;00;09","01;45;02;01","so that's kind of cool to see,"
"01;45;02;01","01;45;03;17","like a sort of it's"
"01;45;03;17","01;45;05;28","not a conclusion on our series,"
"01;45;05;28","01;45;07;03","but these,"
"01;45;07;03","01;45;08;03","these questions"
"01;45;08;03","01;45;10;18","which are often the next step"
"01;45;10;18","01;45;11;19","for other papers"
"01;45;13;14","01;45;14;02","discussed in the"
"01;45;14;02","01;45;14;23","DOT to"
"01;45;14;23","01;45;16;02","discuss the, the conclusion"
"01;45;16;02","01;45;17;06","or the discussion."
"01;45;17;06","01;45;20;21","That's where this work picked up."
"01;45;21;10","01;45;23;17","And so that that's a,"
"01;45;23;17","01;45;24;17","a different attribute"
"01;45;24;17","01;45;25;09","than we've seen"
"01;45;25;09","01;45;27;09","from some of the other literature"
"01;45;27;10","01;45;29;07","we discussed"
"01;45;32;13","01;45;33;11","Blue."
"01;45;33;20","01;45;35;07","Dave, do you have any other thoughts?"
"01;45;35;07","01;45;37;03","Patricia would you like to give any"
"01;45;37;03","01;45;38;27","final comments"
"01;45;42;01","01;45;44;04","I think I have said, you know,"
"01;45;44;04","01;45;48;03","unless you have a last question"
"01;45;48;03","01;45;49;22","what papers I am,"
"01;45;49;22","01;45;50;27","I am a little bigger print."
"01;45;50;27","01;45;52;16","Sorry, I'm a little bit of an outsider"
"01;45;52;16","01;45;53;23","in the free energy principle,"
"01;45;53;23","01;45;54;21","I must confess."
"01;45;54;21","01;45;55;14","But"
"01;45;56;17","01;45;59;25","I I would like to see how it progress."
"01;45;59;25","01;46;02;01","So I say, as I said at the beginning,"
"01;46;02;06","01;46;05;10","we are not against the free energy"
"01;46;05;10","01;46;06;21","principle Apriori."
"01;46;06;21","01;46;08;14","So if our paper can lead"
"01;46;08;14","01;46;09;25","to more research"
"01;46;09;25","01;46;10;16","in the free energy"
"01;46;10;16","01;46;11;14","principle direction,"
"01;46;11;14","01;46;12;08","we would be happy"
"01;46;12;08","01;46;13;22","and we would consider it a success."
"01;46;13;22","01;46;16;02","So we are not necessarily enemies"
"01;46;16;02","01;46;16;29","of the free energy"
"01;46;16;29","01;46;18;26","principle and I'm in principle"
"01;46;18;26","01;46;19;23","very interested"
"01;46;19;23","01;46;20;23","in the application"
"01;46;20;23","01;46;22;07","of statistical mechanics"
"01;46;22;07","01;46;23;09","and even the language"
"01;46;23;09","01;46;25;04","of dynamical systems to biology."
"01;46;25;04","01;46;27;10","So I am in principle interested"
"01;46;27;10","01;46;29;08","in this type of research"
"01;46;29;08","01;46;30;07","and also in the active"
"01;46;30;07","01;46;30;29","in, for instance,"
"01;46;30;29","01;46;32;29","interdisciplinary research."
"01;46;32;29","01;46;34;21","So I would be very interested in"
"01;46;34;21","01;46;35;28","see how this evolved."
"01;46;35;28","01;46;38;04","And if we as philosophers can contribute"
"01;46;38;04","01;46;38;17","to that"
"01;46;38;17","01;46;39;17","by criticizing"
"01;46;39;17","01;46;41;07","some points that we find"
"01;46;41;07","01;46;42;28","non rigorous enough, then"
"01;46;42;28","01;46;43;25","our job is done."
"01;46;43;25","01;46;45;08","So that's basically our goal"
"01;46;46;29","01;46;48;03","thanks Patricia."
"01;46;48;03","01;46;50;24","Totally agree this."
"01;46;50;24","01;46;53;13","Hopefully we can enact the kind of"
"01;46;53;13","01;46;54;18","dialog at the micro"
"01;46;54;18","01;46;57;09","like a conversation and a disciplinary"
"01;46;58;00","01;46;59;13","or scholarly dialog"
"01;46;59;13","01;47;01;08","that plays out over years"
"01;47;01;08","01;47;03;12","and the philosophers"
"01;47;03;12","01;47;05;27","have a very important role in that blue"
"01;47;08;13","01;47;10;19","to what Patricia was just saying"
"01;47;10;19","01;47;11;28","reminds me of,"
"01;47;11;28","01;47;12;21","you know, when"
"01;47;12;21","01;47;13;27","we discussed Mike"
"01;47;13;27","01;47;16;18","Levin's paper in the summer"
"01;47;16;18","01;47;18;09","the computational boundary of the self,"
"01;47;18;09","01;47;19;27","it's, it's,"
"01;47;19;27","01;47;20;09","you know,"
"01;47;20;09","01;47;22;16","there's the instrumentalist view"
"01;47;22;16","01;47;24;16","and then the realist view"
"01;47;24;16","01;47;27;10","and then the utility axis in that"
"01;47;27;10","01;47;28;21","in that diagram."
"01;47;28;21","01;47;30;06","And so definitely"
"01;47;30;06","01;47;32;08","I thought that this paper was useful"
"01;47;32;08","01;47;34;12","in provoking dialog and"
"01;47;35;18","01;47;39;02","really kind of I would like to leverage"
"01;47;39;02","01;47;40;11","your vantage point"
"01;47;40;11","01;47;41;18","to kind of grind"
"01;47;41;18","01;47;43;02","into some of the deeper,"
"01;47;43;02","01;47;44;12","maybe more mathematical stuff"
"01;47;44;12","01;47;45;13","that's kind of beyond me"
"01;47;45;13","01;47;46;18","because it's not really my"
"01;47;46;18","01;47;47;16","my background,"
"01;47;47;16","01;47;48;14","but to kind of,"
"01;47;48;14","01;47;49;27","you know, dig into that whole"
"01;47;49;27","01;47;50;23","and make sure that there's"
"01;47;50;23","01;47;53;01","a solid foundation under the holder."
"01;47;53;02","01;47;53;26","Is that a hole that pokes"
"01;47;53;26","01;47;55;06","all the way through and leads"
"01;47;55;06","01;47;56;07","to nothing on the other end?"
"01;47;56;07","01;47;57;21","So I think,"
"01;47;57;21","01;47;58;12","you know, it's useful"
"01;47;58;12","01;47;59;18","for for getting at"
"01;47;59;18","01;48;01;05","those those questions."
"01;48;02;24","01;48;05;04","My last question, Patricia, would be"
"01;48;05;04","01;48;08;08","what areas of literature or papers"
"01;48;08;08","01;48;11;11","might you recommend that we dove into"
"01;48;11;26","01;48;15;00","so that we can have a comprehensive view"
"01;48;15;07","01;48;17;22","and know where we're coming from"
"01;48;17;22","01;48;19;00","and where we're going"
"01;48;21;00","01;48;23;15","I, I can mention many, many babies."
"01;48;23;15","01;48;25;17","I can do that better. But email again."
"01;48;25;17","01;48;27;14","So if you're interested in literature"
"01;48;27;14","01;48;29;13","and some specific"
"01;48;31;07","01;48;33;07","research or topic,"
"01;48;33;07","01;48;34;13","just send me an email"
"01;48;34;13","01;48;36;09","and I can recommend philosophically to"
"01;48;36;09","01;48;38;02","but I would like to specially recommend"
"01;48;38;02","01;48;40;20","one paper so I can choose"
"01;48;40;20","01;48;43;03","and I don't know the title."
"01;48;43;03","01;48;43;14","Right,"
"01;48;43;16","01;48;44;08","so hopefully,"
"01;48;44;08","01;48;47;07","but it's, it's a Baby by Kareem Tibor"
"01;48;48;23","01;48;49;29","who is called Something"
"01;48;49;29","01;48;52;00","about Imperialism and Migration."
"01;48;52;00","01;48;53;22","So I can look at that now"
"01;48;53;22","01;48;55;19","because it really it's"
"01;48;55;19","01;48;57;02","a very general paper"
"01;48;57;02","01;48;59;17","in philosophy of science where"
"01;49;01;04","01;49;02;23","they draw a very nice"
"01;49;02;23","01;49;04;00","distinction between"
"01;49;04;00","01;49;06;26","migration of models and imperialism"
"01;49;07;02","01;49;07;24","of models"
"01;49;07;24","01;49;08;09","that I think"
"01;49;08;09","01;49;08;19","would be"
"01;49;08;19","01;49;09;10","also useful"
"01;49;09;10","01;49;10;25","in the interdisciplinary research"
"01;49;10;25","01;49;12;12","that you are doing"
"01;49;12;26","01;49;15;09","because they, they stress the difference"
"01;49;15;09","01;49;16;28","about using the methods"
"01;49;16;28","01;49;17;26","for or exploiting"
"01;49;17;26","01;49;18;09","the methods"
"01;49;18;09","01;49;21;20","from one discipline to the other"
"01;49;21;20","01;49;23;10","in a non"
"01;49;23;10","01;49;24;10","imperialist way,"
"01;49;24;10","01;49;25;12","which would imply"
"01;49;25;12","01;49;26;29","that in the new discipline"
"01;49;26;29","01;49;28;22","you have to justify"
"01;49;28;22","01;49;31;17","the model, you have to justify"
"01;49;31;17","01;49;33;23","their mathematical methods."
"01;49;33;23","01;49;35;07","That's, that's the one model"
"01;49;35;07","01;49;36;24","from the migration imperialism."
"01;49;36;24","01;49;37;17","Brilliant."
"01;49;38;00","01;49;38;28","And they distinguish"
"01;49;38;28","01;49;39;15","between that,"
"01;49;39;15","01;49;41;15","that they call migration of models"
"01;49;41;15","01;49;43;07","from imperial imperialism"
"01;49;43;07","01;49;44;19","in which you just"
"01;49;44;19","01;49;46;20","extrapolate the same models"
"01;49;46;20","01;49;48;18","from one discipline to the other"
"01;49;48;18","01;49;51;09","and you try to expand your discipline,"
"01;49;51;09","01;49;52;29","which would be sort of the,"
"01;49;52;29","01;49;55;17","the attitude that you wear your"
"01;49;56;29","01;49;57;11","and that"
"01;49;57;11","01;49;58;06","was illustrated"
"01;49;58;06","01;49;58;14","in the,"
"01;49;58;14","01;50;00;11","in the comics that you were discussing"
"01;50;00;11","01;50;02;00","class last week."
"01;50;02;00","01;50;03;03","So I think that paper"
"01;50;03;03","01;50;05;03","especially useful for, for,"
"01;50;05;03","01;50;05;26","for people doing"
"01;50;05;26","01;50;07;04","interdisciplinary search"
"01;50;07;04","01;50;09;13","because it's a very useful distinction."
"01;50;09;29","01;50;12;04","This model is on the move."
"01;50;12;13","01;50;14;11","Thanks for the awesome suggestion."
"01;50;14;11","01;50;17;18","So just to the point about"
"01;50;17;18","01;50;18;06","emails"
"01;50;18;06","01;50;19;13","or however it goes,"
"01;50;19;13","01;50;22;01","just consider the dialog opened."
"01;50;22;01","01;50;23;25","We really appreciate that"
"01;50;23;25","01;50;25;19","both of you came to discuss"
"01;50;25;19","01;50;27;29","and also interacted with the Zero"
"01;50;27;29","01;50;29;24","and one videos."
"01;50;29;24","01;50;33;13","So just awesome work with research"
"01;50;33;13","01;50;37;03","and thanks again for helping our lab"
"01;50;37;15","01;50;38;25","do what it does."
"01;50;38;25","01;50;41;09","And this is also an excellent suggestion"
"01;50;42;00","01;50;44;21","because it's a it's a provocative title,"
"01;50;45;06","01;50;47;09","but we're talking about"
"01;50;47;09","01;50;51;06","provocative ideas and with broad scope"
"01;50;51;06","01;50;52;04","and this kind of takes"
"01;50;52;04","01;50;54;20","that map territory discussion"
"01;50;55;10","01;50;57;11","to a new place,"
"01;50;57;29","01;51;00;03","potentially talking about"
"01;51;00;03","01;51;03;06","movements and imperialism and"
"01;51;04;12","01;51;05;19","colonization"
"01;51;05;19","01;51;06;20","all these other"
"01;51;06;20","01;51;08;23","things that come up in different terms."
"01;51;08;23","01;51;10;02","But we've noted this"
"01;51;10;02","01;51;12;28","in our upcoming Streams calendar."
"01;51;13;25","01;51;16;24","So after our lab meeting next week,"
"01;51;17;21","01;51;19;06","we'll have stochastic chaos"
"01;51;19;06","01;51;20;19","and Markov blankets"
"01;51;20;19","01;51;21;14","that will complement"
"01;51;21;14","01;51;22;06","some of the things"
"01;51;22;06","01;51;25;06","that we didn't talk about in 31"
"01;51;25;06","01;51;27;13","we'll talk in 33, thinking like a state"
"01;51;27;24","01;51;30;00","with a model survival."
"01;51;30;19","01;51;33;03","And then I have two more slots open, so"
"01;51;33;03","01;51;34;18","perhaps we'll select one of these"
"01;51;34;18","01;51;36;07","that we've already listed"
"01;51;36;07","01;51;39;01","or perhaps somebody wants to join"
"01;51;39;05","01;51;41;15","if an author wants to discuss."
"01;51;41;15","01;51;42;12","And"
"01;51;43;14","01;51;44;21","other than that,"
"01;51;44;26","01;51;47;09","I think that brings us to a close today."
"01;51;47;09","01;51;48;26","So again,"
"01;51;48;26","01;51;50;21","big appreciation to the authors"
"01;51;50;21","01;51;52;04","for their work and engagement"
"01;51;52;04","01;51;52;22","with the lab."
"01;51;52;22","01;51;53;28","And thanks, Steven"
"01;51;53;28","01;51;54;24","Dave and Blue"
"01;51;54;24","01;51;55;21","and everyone else"
"01;51;55;21","01;51;57;14","who participated and Maxwell"
"01;51;57;14","01;51;59;06","for joining the Dark One."
"01;51;59;06","01;52;02;14","So good times and we will see you"
"01;52;02;14","01;52;02;28","next time."
"01;52;04;25","01;52;05;12","Thank you."
"01;52;05;12","01;52;06;22","Thank you very much. Bye."
