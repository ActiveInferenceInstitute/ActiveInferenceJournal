"Unknown","00;00;08;02","00;00;39;12","Hello and welcome everyone to act in five live stream number 31.1. Yes, we are live so today it's October 19th 2021 and we're going to be having a discussion on the paper non equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology. So welcome to the Active Inference Lab everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;39;25","00;01;01;20","You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for lectures. At this short link, you can see the past and upcoming live streams."
"Unknown","00;01;01;24","00;01;23;04","Here we are at the end of October 2021 in paper number 31 and today we're going to be having an awesome group discussion and then next week we hope to have one or both of the authors join us. So we'll be taking a lot of notes today and bringing up good things to talk with them on. And all of these are participatory live streams."
"Unknown","00;01;23;04","00;01;51;27","So if you want to join or if you want to co-organized with us, just let us know. Today in 31.1, we're just going to be learning and discussing this paper of Palacios and Colombo, and we're just putting out some perspective, giving some affordances for others to join in and hopefully learning along the way. So we have a few questions that Blue and others have prepared."
"Unknown","00;01;52;13","00;02;26;13","Maxwell also prepared some notes to talk about, and we're just pretty much going to look through the questions that we have already written up. We'll add more. Anyone in the YouTube live chat who wants to ask a question? They're more than welcome to do so, and we'll just hop around wherever we need to go. We'll start off with the introductions, so we'll just say hi and maybe something that we liked about the paper or something that stuck with us or something that brought us to this conversation."
"Unknown","00;02;26;19","00;02;55;19","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I think something I'm excited about today maybe would be to look at this intersection of biology and thermodynamics and talk a little bit about the different ways we can approach that intersection. This paper has some formalisms, but not all the formalisms. There weren't figures, but there's so many graphical intuitions related to free energy landscapes and some other pieces."
"Unknown","00;02;55;19","00;03;24;27","So it just kind of cool to think about what are the different ways that we come to learn about the intersections of these cool ideas. And I'll pass to Steven. Hello. Yes, Stephen, I'm in Toronto in Canada. Pleased to be here again. And I'm interested in this paper, the general topic of Ergot. This city comes up and I'm interested to see I often see these papers which have sort of free energy principal focus rather than say active inference focus."
"Unknown","00;03;24;28","00;03;59;01","So just to see how in that when that tree gets shaken, how that helps or hinders the sort of more process theory work, which is probably closer to where I'm interested in. But this is all very interesting. Thanks. I'll pass it over to Maxwell and Maxwell Ramstad. I'm the CEO of Nested Mines Network and active in Friends I start up and I am a fellow at the Welcome Center for Human Neuroimaging UCL in London."
"Unknown","00;04;01;02","00;04;41;17","I'm looking forward to discussing this paper. I think there's a lot to disagree with and I'll try to be collegial in my criticism. Beautiful. What more could we ask for? Let's start with the big question and of course other of you if you have a different take or there's other big questions. But this big question, which is in this paper as well as the broader literature, what fundamental ideas from physics are utilized in free energy principle and active inference?"
"Unknown","00;04;41;17","00;05;05;22","And how and just what are the implications or tradeoffs associated with the use of this idea? Does it lend credibility to a theory to be grounded in physics? What does it mean to a theory for it to be grounded in a certain physical idea? Does it constrain does it prevent us from making the kinds of conclusions that we might want to draw about biological systems?"
"Unknown","00;05;06;04","00;05;48;13","So that's kind of the big question. Do either of you have any other sort of big questions that this raises, or what is the alignment of the vector of this paper with the bigger ongoing threads in our research community? Well, I mean, I guess one outstanding question for me is what is the horizon a relevant literature in terms of time course that one needs to consider before trying to engage with and criticize this material it's something that comes up."
"Unknown","00;05;48;13","00;06;28;29","I think it might be useful to discuss maybe before we go into the specifics there, just when we're engaging in interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary scholarship or we're diving into fields where we might not have taken courses to the undergraduate or higher level, just it's a really important question, how do we make appropriate claims? You know, how do you take a little bit of a of a dip into the rabbit hole and come out with something that's useful rather than just being more confused than when you made the initial search?"
"Unknown","00;06;29;12","00;06;58;04","So these are big questions. Any thoughts or just how do we determine what literature are relevant? Like if we wanted to write a paper on something that related to active inference or just in general, what do we do? Do we do keywords do we only look at the last five years are you asking the question rhetorically or do you want us to trying to maybe Stephen first with the recent, but then just either I mean, Stephen, I don't yes."
"Unknown","00;07;00;14","00;07;25;12","Stephen unmute and then continue. I'm probably not the best person because I keep digging and digging and digging, but I think it's a good question. I'm from a chemistry background, a long way back, and I always find it interesting as well because, you know, a lot of stuff that's used is well developed, comes from chemistry actually and uses physics."
"Unknown","00;07;25;12","00;07;51;07","But you know, the like you say that we're in this kind of need to approximate and an approximation like there's so many things that come up that are like new, new ways of describing stuff, which makes total sense. Like I've read through the free energy principle and Kristen's work about the talk about approximation science and that science is ultimately an approximation."
"Unknown","00;07;52;02","00;08;24;15","And then, you know, it takes me a couple of days to then get my head around that. And it's like, yeah, that totally makes sense. But the implications of all of that are huge. The implications of being in non equilibrium states itself disrupts a lot of the accuracy of, of certain ways that you can roll out things from physics and how you roll it out into chemistry, which is normally equilibrium chemistry like we've all in our straight into biology, we roll it out into something slightly different with all this modeling."
"Unknown","00;08;24;15","00;08;53;06","So I think it does cause some challenges in terms of discussions because it's easy for other people to start and in the free energy principle and active inference community what they are and then start telling them and framing what they're not and by which point it's kind of hard to have a discussion because it's like the straw man's been set up."
"Unknown","00;08;54;13","00;09;22;16","And I think that can be a little bit challenging for some conversations to move forward because now you've got a complex idea trying to, first of all, counter the fact that other people's paradigms have been challenged. So I think that itself, I don't know if that's a literature thing or whether that's a cognitive thing. But I think that that is part of the challenge that seems to be faced I agree."
"Unknown","00;09;22;16","00;09;43;02","Stephen, thanks for that. And it's maybe a good segue way. Maxwell, we can just start to hear some of your thoughts and I'll be typing some notes and maybe asking some follow ups and unpacking because I know you have a lot to say on this, so maybe just go for it and I'll just type along and we'll see where we go."
"Unknown","00;09;43;07","00;10;17;14","I mean, I guess that's probably the thing that I find most puzzling about the paper is that it claims to be the first in the literature, essentially to be looking at the connection between the physics of the free energy physics and the free energy principle. And and I find this puzzling because it seems to me that the connection between physics and the free energy principle has been really maybe thus the focus of active research in our community for like four years or so."
"Unknown","00;10;19;08","00;11;06;17","So, I mean, you know, the that Carl published, or at least preprinted his particular physics monograph in January, 2019. And you know, prior to that we had all been working on, I mean, effectively the connections, the physics. So I find this problematic because the work that we're going to discuss today focuses on, you know, older formulations of the free energy principle where the connections to physics were maybe less obvious I mean, as most of us in the community know now, the formal foundations of the free energy principle been subject to extensive debate over the last three years or so."
"Unknown","00;11;08;17","00;11;38;20","Kind of Martin Beal and colleagues kind of started, started, started us off in this direction. And, you know, since Martin and, you know, a few other groups have produced, you know, a stimulated interesting discussion through their very interesting and technically rigorous critiques of the free energy principle. But really, it seems to me that this has been a focus of our discussions for the last several years, the connections to physics and so on."
"Unknown","00;11;40;13","00;12;33;08","And where this has gotten us is the Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes, paper that was recently released, which accounts for the critical remarks that have been raised. And, you know, so really where we're at now is that we have formulations that start from non equilibrium statistical mechanics and information geometry and, and you know, saying, well, all systems that have stationary density dynamics and a march, all blanket will look as if their internal states are, you know, modeling in a loose sense or in a more technical sense encoding the parameters of probability distributions or Bayesian beliefs about external states."
"Unknown","00;12;33;11","00;13;00;13","That's sort of where we're left with. And you get it, you get to this from the physics. So I just found that the, the remark was a bit puzzling and the choice of literature was also, I think, a little puzzling for the the same reasons. I mean, I have more specific thoughts, but I mean, this is sort of for your first bullet point in response to the last one that we had."
"Unknown","00;13;00;13","00;13;35;00","And what's the relevant time horizon I feel like a rapidly developing theory, like the active inference framework and the free energy principle. I mean, if you're going to be producing technical critical material, you should probably be working from the most recent versions. I mean, I find it puzzling for instance, that the authors spend so much time talking about airgood the city when the word ergodic doesn't appear or just just about never appears in the particular physics monograph."
"Unknown","00;13;35;09","00;14;07;19","So anyway, I just find that there's a kind of disconnect between what's presented here and the actual work on the physics of the free energy principle that that we have seen. And I think that leads to several of the arguments being proposed, being a bit missing their mark, to put it diplomatically. Thank you for the concise summary, Maxwell."
"Unknown","00;14;07;19","00;14;32;17","So Steven, with arrays hand and then we'll continue could I ask a little question as well relates to this is in the very first part of the abstract, it talks about the inevitable, an emergent property of any exotic random dynamic system of non equilibrium steady state that possesses a mark of blanket. So that's a quote from the paper from 2013."
"Unknown","00;14;33;05","00;15;12;20","The thing is it says before that according to the free energy principle, life is an in and then it quotes inevitable an emergent property which is the quote. But I'm not sure that life is ever talked of as an inevitable an emergent property of any event. Got it. Random dynamical system in terms of how it's reference and I'm wondering if there's a bit of a confusion in the paper there where it talks about this that quote but makes it as if that's what life that life is an emergent and an emergent property."
"Unknown","00;15;12;20","00;15;45;22","And I think it's I think what we're talking about is adaptive reduction of surprise or Bayesian inference properties is an inevitable an emergent property. But I don't know if that would be life. I don't know what your thoughts are on that or whether I'm misreading that. That reminds me of one of my favorite papers. What is life answering Schrodinger's question by Maxwell at all in 2018?"
"Unknown","00;15;47;05","00;16;20;27","Because maybe you could even say something to this. What is the relationship between reducing surprise and life? And do these recent technical developments in FFP help bridge the gap between inanimate and living cognitive or computational processes? And where does physics play into that that's that's very interesting. I mean, I think the, the FTP itself, uh, is not a theory of life just in and of itself."
"Unknown","00;16;21;01","00;16;51;19","Right. What, what it is, it's a theory to understand, uh, systems that are able to maintain themselves in non equilibrium regime effectively. So or I mean more precisely, you know, stationary systems with the blanket, which is to say the same according to the theory so I've gone on the record as saying that the free energy principle can allow us to construct a theory of life."
"Unknown","00;16;53;03","00;17;33;26","But the claim isn't just that the free energy principle in and of itself allows you to do that. I think, you know, the EP needs to appeal to auxiliary hypotheses from biological and other sciences to really do that. I mean it's a theory of things ness in physical systems that interest us and a subclass of those systems, our biological systems so I mean, it is an aid in the formulation and probably the foundation of the formulation of living systems."
"Unknown","00;17;33;28","00;17;56;20","So, so long as we agree that living systems are a subclass of persisting systems. And I mean, there's some talk in this paper that maybe this persistence, living system of this persistence might not be the right way to think about life. But yeah, I think it acts as a foundation. I mean, but then you need to add a lot more to turn that into a theory of life."
"Unknown","00;17;56;20","00;18;31;03","I mean, if you read my Schrodinger paper carefully, for example, what we propose is a variational approach to neuro mythology. We're not saying that the free energy principle in and of itself can just offer this like the free energy principle have two uses. It has to be used as a foundation from which you can build these variational approaches to neuropathology, the new construction to ecology or what have you so I mean, you know, that that might just be picking, nit picking."
"Unknown","00;18;31;03","00;19;13;29","So like I well, I don't want to double down on that too much. It's good points and it's almost related to the definition or the distinction between like a discipline and a trans discipline. If FFP is a discipline versus if it's connecting other disciplines, variational neuropathology, it's right there in the title, we're connecting across different areas and the framework of thinking this is one of those enabling features that helps it be an integrative theory, but potentially it doesn't fulfill the disciplinary uses of theory."
"Unknown","00;19;13;29","00;19;53;19","So that's one interesting idea. I guess there's many other ways to go or things to ask. I guess I'm just I'm curious again, like Maxwell, what do you think in the last few years, how have we clarified or learned more about where active inference and fip are related to each other? So how was that thought of in five years ago, maybe when you were in grad school and then what do you think is sort of contemporary Greetings Blue in terms of the distinction between active inference and FFP and then yellow and blue and you can add anything you'd like."
"Unknown","00;19;54;06","00;20;20;00","And I know some people want to mark the difference between the two. I think personally I think it's more of a sociological thing because no one or just about no one is contesting the validity of active inference models of cognitive systems. But there's a lot of pressure from different circles on the free energy formulation. So I mean, it might be a sociological thing where it's just easier to say, Oh, I don't work on this more."
"Unknown","00;20;20;06","00;20;37;20","You know, metaphysics sounding thing. I just work on computational neuroscience and that's straightforward. I think there's no warrant for that. From a mathematical point of view, you should just, for example, look at the way that things are derived in the Bayesian Mechanics paper."
"Unknown","00;20;40;19","00;21;20;10","Yeah, I feel like active inference just falls out of the the core Bayesian mechanics. I mean, I'd recommend everyone to read through that Bayesian Mechanics paper. It's really fantastic. It's very clear one of the big differences between it and the previous three energy papers is that it's authored by or at least there are two authors out of the four on the paper who are proper mathematicians working on the mathematics of non equilibrium statistical mechanics effectively."
"Unknown","00;21;20;10","00;22;17;03","So, you know, that paper really I think meets the standards of rigor in mathematics. You know, you have an existence proof for the synchronization manifold that's sort of at the core of the whole formal construct, the thing that links internal and external states, and then you have a construction of it. I mean, it's very straightforward and having having established, you know, the kind of core formal apparatus it's unfolding and by the end you know, you what you do is ask, well, all right, let's split the blanket states up into sensory and active states and active inference just falls out of making the active states subject to the dynamics that those are unfolded throughout the paper."
"Unknown","00;22;17;03","00;22;49;13","So in my view, the connection is immediate yeah. I will grant that, you know, some of the computational models that we're using are a bit more they look a lot more like just vanilla you know, computational neuroscience model, you know, their ponds and stuff like that. But but what the math that underwrites it all is the math of the 300 principle."
"Unknown","00;22;49;13","00;23;15;10","So I don't really I don't really think the two can be separated. Thanks, Maxwell. And the Basic Mechanics paper we discussed in Live stream number 26 so it's it is a lot to keep up with sometimes but that was a very fascinating discussion so blue and then anyone else I was wondering if that was Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes."
"Unknown","00;23;15;10","00;23;43;03","The one we did. Yeah, that's precisely it. Yeah. So I, sorry I'm late on the scene, but I'm curious about whether is there a theory of life or does it allow us to construct one and does it only apply to life or can we take it in this kind of psychic direction where even molecules like one to minimize the free energy and self-assemble to become structures that's a very good question."
"Unknown","00;23;44;07","00;24;02;20","I would say that the free energy principle is not a metaphysics so it's it's a physics. So it's a formal framework that may or may not give us grip on the systems that we're interested in."
"Unknown","00;24;04;29","00;24;32;10","So, I mean, you know, I and I know there is some philosophical literature that's presented as more like, you know, a metaphysical statement about what life is but I think it's more useful to think about the Bayesian mechanics is just an extension of mechanics effectively. You know, the the same way the statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics are flavors of mechanics."
"Unknown","00;24;32;10","00;25;02;17","The Bayesian mechanics is also, you know, and I realize that, you know, it's a little deflationary. It's a more instrumentalist reading of the free energy principle, but it's not completely deflationary in the sense that it's the model says that the best model of living and other existing systems is as a model of their environment. So, you know, there's a kind of double instrumental ism at play, I think in the free energy stuff."
"Unknown","00;25;04;22","00;25;15;05","To answer your question a bit more directly, I think it is it can be the can be used to construct the theory of life in and of itself. It's a theory of being yes."
"Unknown","00;25;18;08","00;25;49;15","Yeah. It's a great set of questions to discuss. And I mean, this is only my view. Like, I don't mean to settle this once and for all. There are people who want to defend a more metaphysical view on this I guess the question is how far do you want to take the commitment of the free energy principle? I mean, you know, there are kind of two irreducible assumptions that go into the now there's stationary, which, by the way, is not the same as aggregate a city."
"Unknown","00;25;50;04","00;26;41;09","So, you know, I think the whole section of this argument just doesn't apply at all anymore. The one presented by Columbia and Palacios and Marcos Blanket so I mean, you know, if if you think that, uh, you know, systems that exist at some scale have to be stationary and you think that, you know, systems that exist really do have a mark of a blanket, then you can be realist about the assumptions but I kind of feel that it works whether or not you take the additional philosophical step of committing hard core to the realist assumption you know, it works just as it works as you know, and as if theory, if you will."
"Unknown","00;26;41;09","00;27;15;06","I mean, the whole thing tells you like living systems that existed on a non equilibrium steady state. It had an have a mark all blank. It will look as if they're inferring external states. And I mean yeah, I think this this looks as if stuff is really important. And I realize that, you know, for some of us, it may be a little bit deflationary but I don't know if more is warranted from the math."
"Unknown","00;27;15;06","00;27;51;02","I think that there's a yeah, we just need to be kind of careful thanks for identifying those two key pieces and maybe we'll have more to think about with the stationary and ergot a city so blue with the right hand. Then Stephen so just a couple of things. Like when I say plants like ism, I wasn't trying to go into like the metaphysical realm, but because it's physics, because it's not metaphysics can it then apply to life and non life?"
"Unknown","00;27;51;04","00;28;13;04","Like, can we just go all the way down? Yes. And so in that kind of way, I wasn't really implying as metaphysical constructs, but more in the direct. Does it broadly apply to non-life as well as life? Yeah. And then also just a couple more things. So systems have a Markov blanket like Maxwell. That's you being entirely realist."
"Unknown","00;28;13;29","00;28;39;01","Like I don't have a Marco blanket, but can I be modeled with Markov like it probably so. So I don't, I don't know, like, you know, I don't curl up in my Marco blanket at night when I go to bed, but it's comfy and then just lastly, like going back to the paper, this like so I don't know, that was one of the main questions that I have for the authors is this concept of they say like systems are in dynamic equilibrium."
"Unknown","00;28;39;13","00;29;01;07","Like, I don't think that the non equilibrium steady state density is the same as dynamic equilibrium at all. And that was one of the main questions that I raised. And like dynamic equilibrium really is not it's a chemical process, like a reversible chemical reaction. So I don't I really kind of miss that. That was one of the key things in the paper that I just didn't understand it all."
"Unknown","00;29;01;17","00;29;26;14","Yeah, I, I mean I, I very much agree with you on the point that you're saying, the response that you're raising here. So I mean, regarding the Penn psych ism thing, I mean yeah, you can from physics now kind of say that any system that exists kind of looks as if it has a mind. Then you might not want to go full on the metaphysics of stance like ism, but it certainly warrants that kind of claim."
"Unknown","00;29;26;22","00;29;53;27","I mean, in my view, this paper is making a few critical mistakes, and this is echoed a lot in a lot of the literature coming from more like for people writing about this. I'm just going to cite you know, two sentences from a paper reprinted this year I won't I won't name names, but you'll see the style of what I mean to be as fair as possible."
"Unknown","00;29;53;27","00;30;34;25","We'll do this as in criticize the CEP by attending to the more recent published versions and variants of these claims. And then the next section starts literally the next sentence the work presented in first in 2013 is central to practically all the proposals comparing the CEP and an action and it just goes on and stuff and it's I sort of feel like the physics foundation has moved forward like blue you're pointing it out it's all about non equilibrium steady state and a non equilibrium steady state dynamics and stationary that's importantly different from good city."
"Unknown","00;30;35;09","00;31;20;10","You know the were the nice things about the Bayesian mechanics paper is that it abstracts away from those assumptions. I mean to be clear the free energy principle at its core never really required that the systems that you studied be ergodic we assume and regarding density in some of the earlier publications because it allows us to stand, that's one step in the derivation substituting the time average for the ensemble average and one of the really core derivations, you know, as Carl himself has been pointing out for a long time, you could finesse the math into something else."
"Unknown","00;31;20;20","00;31;47;00","There's no reason why you have to stick with the Ergodic assumption. It was used just in this one step of the derivation. And you know what Lance de Costa and Greg, probably Otis and Company have done in this Bayesian Mechanics paper with Carl is precisely to do the laborious work of actually generalizing the math to non ergodic systems."
"Unknown","00;31;47;00","00;32;26;16","So I mean, I think that's really important. The Bayesian Mechanics paper, you we're in discussions with the people, active discussions that the people who produce the critical material and I mean at this point, I think everyone essentially agrees that Lance's new derivations respond to the critiques by Aguilera and colleagues that came out earlier this year and also the bill it all critique remember the core of the bill at all critique is that for you processes in general of the sort that Carl was using."
"Unknown","00;32;26;23","00;32;56;11","You can't assume that the synchronization manifold will exist between the internal and external states. In fact, that Martin and company have showed is the for a generic or due process you can just it does not exist. But you know, that that doesn't mean that you can find very broad conditions under which the synchronization manifold exists. And that's what Lance and company have done in this new paper I guess critique it."
"Unknown","00;32;56;11","00;33;18;09","All of this is the Sussex Group also did a very interesting analysis of the math doesn't figure it in the particular physics paper know showing that actually the the precise assumptions that Carl uses in the paper would restrict the scope of the CEP to a rather narrow class of systems. But again, Lance just derived all of the equations."
"Unknown","00;33;18;09","00;33;42;13","So the formalism is now effectively different. And what you can really see from the math is that it applies to nonlinear systems and to non ergodic systems. And this leads me to another point. I think the assumption of non equilibrium or steady state is often not understood in the way that it should. The non equilibrium steady state is a characterization of the density dynamics."
"Unknown","00;33;42;17","00;34;09;04","It is not a characterization of the system itself. If I, if I say that a system is that non equilibrium steady state, I'm not saying that it is steadily in some state you know, that it just that it occupy. What I'm saying is that the probability landscape that underwrites its dynamics is stationary or has stopped evolving. Those are two very, very, very different claims."
"Unknown","00;34;09;12","00;34;49;08","So it doesn't follow from the fact that a system has a density that it is his stimulus, it doesn't follow from the, the existence of the next density that there should only be one attractor. Like you can have needs stability in an RFP system, you can have non-linearity in an RFP system, you can have non air city in an RFP system, so yeah, I mean, I think, you know, that means that one of the three sections, the critical sections in this paper are just completely off the mark."
"Unknown","00;34;50;03","00;35;26;05","And, you know, there's this new paper by some of the tenders of the inactive approach on precisely this kind of stuff as well. And unfortunately, the same mistakes are made, you know, arrogant city in the context of the I mean really just means that the, the, the, the quantities that you're observing are measurable it means that the average of your measures converges on average to a measure of the average."
"Unknown","00;35;26;21","00;36;16;10","You know, of the mean that you're actually trying to calculate in a forest sense. So it never meant that systems don't have a history it never meant that systems necessarily converge on one attracting that. And so I really feel that that kind of takes the teeth out of most of the formal criticism in this paper. The other part of the the other critical parts of this paper talk about, you know, the challenges of modeling by biological systems using state spaces, but that those sections to me don't amount to much more than just saying it would be very difficult to do this therefore it's not doable or something like that."
"Unknown","00;36;16;20","00;36;40;15","And, you know, I, I have a lot of friends who are computational biologists and I speak to a lot of people doing this. And it's sort of like, well, you know, some work would have to be done to write a paper to respond to this. But, you know, what's the expression? One person's modus tolerance is another person's modest modus ponents or like, you know, I sort of feel like, all right, well, you know, you say this is impossible."
"Unknown","00;36;41;13","00;37;07;09","I know that formally. You know, Alex, Alex Jens is a really cool guy and he's brilliant. He and the stuff team have recently, recently, I mean, this is two years old, so it's not that recently. And I feel like this should be accounted for in this paper, but have recently automated state space construction in the free energy framework."
"Unknown","00;37;07;09","00;37;52;26","Like we have active inference models now. They can kind of automatically assemble and can handle up to it's either 10,000 or a million states. So you know, that's a lot of modeling power. And I find the example that they discuss in the footnote there, however, this is on page 11. However, the size of the genotype space for a protein consisting of ten residues chosen from an alphabet of amino acids, the size and the DN and then they say, oh well you know, it's like 20 to the 100 or ten to the 130 possible states if you wanted to model like you know, amino acids, what they're not considering is the nested formulation."
"Unknown","00;37;52;26","00;38;12;28","And I kind of feel like nested nested densities should have been at the core of this argument. And figure nowhere. Yeah, I mean of course if you think that you can just plot all of the states of the system across all the scales at which it exists in one homogenous states space, you're going to run into a problem, but you're not."
"Unknown","00;38;12;28","00;38;40;11","If you carefully construct these states bases in the kind of nested fashion, you know, like a friend of mine, then the tower works on. I pulled this paper up. He has a really cool preprint, a deep learning approach to capture the essence of Candida albicans, morphologies. And I mean basically their what they do is start with a population of Candida, which is a fungus for those of you who don't know."
"Unknown","00;38;41;07","00;39;08;01","And then you you just randomly generate a CRISPR and you introduce it into the population and you see how the population develops and you plot each population trajectory in a 30,000 parameter hyper parameter space, effectively and you see the way that the Candida self-organize into pockets depending on their, you know, the kind of procedures that you put into them."
"Unknown","00;39;09;11","00;39;51;13","I mean, this is not like fringe work. This is just routine computational biology where we're already plotting phenotypic expression and 30,000 dimensional spaces, you know, this isn't like forthcoming work to be done. I mean, it's really just standard work. It's interesting how you know, I think they modified the paper. We had discussed this in a live stream before and the they nicely added some responses to some of the criticisms that I raise in discussion I'd have to pull it out."
"Unknown","00;39;51;13","00;40;32;25","But, you know, I said, well, you know, we're using this stuff in studies of cancer dynamics. And like so I wrote in the paper, you know, we can think of a biological systems extended phenotype as the set of extracting attracting states of a couple of dynamical system. And this is supported by studies of cancer, genesis and propagation I can link the papers and they say, well, you know, these studies provide evidence that cancer can be fruitfully modeled and understood as an attractor and a dynamical system, but they don't provide us with evidence that all biological systems occupy in the tractor."
"Unknown","00;40;32;25","00;41;09;22","And I'm sort of thinking like, well, no, but you know, this is a counterexample to you're saying that it's not doable in a real biological system, you know, so, you know, if I if I'm being snarky, I feel like this is armchair biology of the worst kind kind of. You're telling me that what I'm doing is impossible while I'm doing it and you know, and you're doing it by appealing to, like, you know, an old conception of the physics, by talking about assumptions that aren't even part of the formalism anymore."
"Unknown","00;41;09;22","00;41;53;16","I mean, I just I find that there's a lot to object to in this paper, both in terms of the substance and in terms of the general kind of strategy of kind of gotcha and now, does the free energy principle need to be discussed critically? Absolutely. And, you know, I should have caveat all this by saying that some of the most interesting and stimulating intellectual exchanges that I've had in my life have been with the people creating critical material but, you know, the the people that are generating this interesting critical material are actually engaging with the theory at its formal core."
"Unknown","00;41;54;13","00;42;25;07","And, you know, I sort of feel like some of these things would have just been cleared up with you know, a few conversations and looking at the more recent material. But now I feel like I'm just kvetching at this point thank you, Maxwell. That's what these discussions are for and hopefully bringing into the open. It's just about my perspective to give you to give you a specific idea why this is problematic."
"Unknown","00;42;25;07","00;42;57;13","Like if you focus on the city and not on the nested densities, then you're going to say things like, well, first you have to show that there's an attractor and then you have to show that the relaxation time is biologically plausible. And they claim that neither of these things are done in the free energy literature when literally, you know, the core 40 or 50 pages of Karl's physics monograph deal with, you know, Dan, I know we've read it all together during the last year like I don't know how you how they could have missed this."
"Unknown","00;42;57;13","00;43;50;20","I mean it's the physics monograph this is supposed to be their topic. The core of the physics monograph is all about information links effectively right and relaxation times back to non equilibrium steady state and how all these things kind of work in a nested way to get you biological dynamics. So it seems to me like they are just completely missing their target by both by working out on formulations that are out of date and that introduce assumptions that are no longer at play, and also by just really ignoring, you know, the physics stuff, the free energy physics stuff that they claim to be criticizing you know, so we need to be just like if we"
"Unknown","00;43;50;20","00;44;17;18","were going to catch a baseball, we need to be performing anticipatory knowledge work, not merely reactive, especially to previous formats. And then if it's reactive, I mean, you know, react to the recent stuff. I mean, you know, there's been a concerted effort to ground this in the physics of non equilibrium systems. Like non-legal Libyan statistical mechanics, information geometry."
"Unknown","00;44;17;29","00;44;40;22","I mean, if you're going to be writing a criticism of that stuff, then you should probably be writing about that stuff is sort of my point. And you know, and by the way, this often goes really badly when I point out that, hey, you know, you're, you're working from a you know, an outdated thing. They say, oh, you know, the free energy version 25 from this morning and blah, blah, blah."
"Unknown","00;44;40;23","00;45;03;09","I kind of feel like, you know, my friend if you want to write a criticism of something like you should be as charitable as possible with the target of your criticism on the one hand. And you should definitely not be working on versions of this that no one in the community is still working on. And there is a dimension of like, if you can't keep up, then I don't know, you know, I don't know who benefits from."
"Unknown","00;45;03;09","00;45;32;28","This is sort of like my my questioning is like, OK, so Stephen. And then blue. Yeah, I think thanks for giving us a good, good insight there. I think the psych, the sociological psychological piece is, is present in all of this, as you say. And I think I've mentioned this before to Max, what actually consider the danger of systems to most systems."
"Unknown","00;45;32;28","00;45;59;29","I think even if you were talking to people in the international society system sciences, they often talk about systems, system dynamics and everything else. Things complex systems kind of gets lumped into complexity, right? So there's a danger because I don't think Carl necessarily would say system. Right? And that term system, I think, gets you into a lot of challenges because the folk psychology of what a system is, is what we see as from the outside."
"Unknown","00;46;00;18","00;46;19;24","And you know, these non equilibrium statistics. I'm wondering whether we say ma, he says blankets all the way up and down, but I'm not sure if it's more like thinking this all the way up and down is safer than systems all the way up and down because things can have all sorts of, you know, and they can have state and they can be what they are."
"Unknown","00;46;20;03","00;46;51;02","And the question really becomes then within all that ERG, this is which unlike physics, which tends to be about getting things to a certain number of decimal points of accuracy and it's a messy thing. You know, I assume that that thing about approximation science, I mean, again, that gets your head around what that that makes suddenly you got well, the main thing is you just need enough of whatever this stationary extractable data is to be able to do something with it."
"Unknown","00;46;51;11","00;47;14;26","And I'm kind of thinking that may be because in the same way that in chemistry if you have a beaker and you stir it up and basically the thing will have its dynamics, it will move based on the energy between the different things. And basically entropy is just basically either the force that's pushing it in the way that you don't expect it to."
"Unknown","00;47;15;01","00;47;37;07","Exactly. You know, we know it does this from this equilibrium state. We knows that entropy is just the thing in the middle. Not no one has a bloody clue what's why. It's just a black box right now. But that's because they're going now when you go to these non equilibrium from equilibrium chemistry state, they're held, which you don't do."
"Unknown","00;47;37;07","00;48;03;06","When you mix up a beacon, just go from A to B now we don't know how many non equilibrium states these reactions go through, to be honest in those cases now. But you wouldn't call the beaker a system, you call it a solution, you'd call it, you know, you might call the vessel and the chemical plant in which it reacts a system, but you just sort it kind of a beaker of stuff or things that's doing stuff and things, right?"
"Unknown","00;48;03;06","00;48;24;03","And then you sort of see what it does and then it's like, what can we do that's useful? And normally what's useful is what energy shifts. But in this case you've also saying the entropy can be useful, but not in the way most people would the what we could say, the folk systems thinkers would kind of tend to think about it."
"Unknown","00;48;24;03","00;48;52;10","So I'm just wondering if there's a danger of using the word system. Yeah, I would agree. I mean, I think we use the term system just because, you know, all of this grows out of dynamic systems theory in some sense. You know, it talks of particles, right? Like a, a, a a system with a blanket. And those are the three energy stuff is a particle in his account."
"Unknown","00;48;53;18","00;49;23;29","So yeah, there is a so there's a there's a linguistic danger here because I agree with you, this is not what people think of when they hear the word system. A lot of our senses, as you pointed out, season have turned around that specific point. I think the term is important because especially in the context of relating the step to like the four E approaches, I think it's not appreciated sufficiently that the math is what happens if you take dynamical systems theory seriously."
"Unknown","00;49;25;13","00;49;50;07","You know, so when I was doing my undergrad, I was reading the four E guys and the 40 people this is not just guy. And yeah, the 40 people were telling me, all right, well, you know, computer theory, you only get so far in the study of cognition you have to do dynamical systems, learn the math and learn the physics of complex systems."
"Unknown","00;49;50;19","00;50;16;26","So I did, and several of us did but what happens is then if you continue asking questions along that direction, things arise like, well, how do you measure distances between the states and if you start asking that kind of question, inevitably information and entropy creep back into the picture because that's how you measure distances between states effectively is in."
"Unknown","00;50;16;27","00;50;49;09","That's another information theoretic unit. So I mean, this is to me the great irony of this whole, you know, versus in activism confrontation, which is slowly turning into like one of the big discussions in contemporary philosophy is I don't think that the 40 people fully appreciate that the FFP stuff is just a prolongation of their thinking style, that if you if you really want to take seriously the core tenets of embodied cognition, then inevitably you are led back to information."
"Unknown","00;50;50;11","00;51;14;28","There's no escape. It's really if you want to take their own framework seriously, there's no other place to go. But here I unfortunately have to leave now. Thank you, Maxwell. Thank you for listening to me rant about this. I'll try to be there next week. Um, and yeah, I mean, keep kicking ass. I mean, Dan Blue I just love active and friends love."
"Unknown","00;51;14;28","00;51;35;19","And I'm so grateful for the awesome work that you do keeping this community alive even. It's always a pleasure to talk with you, and I'm glad to see that. You know, there's so much. So much. Yeah. You're just there all the time. And I just love your you your contributions to the conversation. It's always a pleasure to talk to you."
"Unknown","00;51;35;19","00;51;57;07","So I'll big love to everyone, and I will be in touch shortly. Apologies for the snarkiness and just, you know, the thing this is the kind of paper that really grinds my gear. And I thought it was it was good to just point out a few of what I think are the issues. Thank you, Maxwell. See you soon."
"Unknown","00;51;58;06","00;52;35;10","Goodbye. This bullet will go to you. But this is a you know, it's a key difference between being an organizer and a facilitator or a participant. We're here to help scaffold individuals to participate and their perspectives. And that's the second order cybernetics. So things will get more contentious than we can even imagine. And someone just has to hold down the broadcasting, make sure that hands are being raised and that protocol is being respected because there are serious first level questions to resolve."
"Unknown","00;52;35;26","00;53;03;17","But we can have precision in our second level policy and that's going to return to a question in the live chat. But first, blue with a raised hand. Thank you. So I just wanted to say that a lot of what both Maxwell was saying and what Steven said just really underscores the need for consistent definitions, like how do we define a system and also like a consistent synthesis of the FIP?"
"Unknown","00;53;03;20","00;53;28;22","Like historically, where did it start? Where has it been, where is it going? And like where are the landmarks? Like, for example, this basic Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes, paper, you know, has revamped the math and physics and when we're making a new paper or a new argument, are we working with the current version of the model? Absolutely."
"Unknown","00;53;29;03","00;53;56;19","Nice foreshadowing of some work that we're involved in. But if anyone is interested in sort of scholarship and a history from an empirical perspective on FFP and active, they should get in touch with Blue or AI because this is a project that we're super keen on, but it's a very important point. And that's why in our zero we had like this slide with the active inference lab, the working ontology."
"Unknown","00;53;56;19","00;54;26;18","So we're going in a participatory way and we're working through these terms and we're finding where it's quoted in the literature, how it's used in the literature, and then we're adding notes and relevant resources and we'll be developing curriculum that helps make simple declarative uses of these terms so that we don't get lost and we'll have the terms and we'll have the specifics of literature, and it'll be an awesome environment for learning, applying and communicating active inference."
"Unknown","00;54;26;29","00;55;10;00","So before Stephen, you want to go with the question and then we'll go to the live chat. Well, I'll just add to that point you just made is I think is really going to be important because we've seen the confusions that can happen, but also it's likely that there's going to be a kind of a multi ontology. There might be something in this whole field that speaks to how this changes just in the way the cow Fiston talks about when something is regimes to an info max focus versus a Hamilton this action focus versus you know, a rewards focus."
"Unknown","00;55;10;00","00;55;40;20","So there may well be this commonality and there may also be a wide to process when things systems policy particles become, you know, derivate ions. And you know, that's going to be interesting because there may be some nexus, whether it's called metaphysics or whether it's something more for you know, less less out there, maybe it can be grounded."
"Unknown","00;55;41;10","00;56;00;02","And I think that's that starting to come up as we we hit, you know, that's transdisciplinary for you right it's going to you're going to want to know what's in the discipline piece. So maybe there will be stuff which is kind of grounded in the biology world and grounded in the physics world. And he's going to talk as best it can their language."
"Unknown","00;56;00;06","00;56;22;22","Right. And then there's going to be stuff which is in the applied world, which ultimately starts to go transdisciplinary at some point as soon as you get out and get to any sort of scale. So I think that's going to be very, very interesting. Awesome. And both Stephen and Blue and many others join US Weekly in dot edu where we talk about this."
"Unknown","00;56;22;22","00;56;44;11","So let me read a few of the awesome comments from the live chat and ask a question from the live chat and anyone else can continue to ask a question. So there's a lot of discussion on the systems question. And Yvonne said Maxwell, subscribe to our systems thinking course we will discuss what the system is from the standpoint of systems engineering."
"Unknown","00;56;44;23","00;57;23;25","So that's really important. Thanks, Yvonne. For sharing that. And indeed, two of the fundamental pillars or ontologies or trans disciplines of active inference lab are active inference and systems engineering. So those are the perspectives that we draw on and seek synthesis and application of, and we're all learning a lot and it will be updating our generative model in a way that changes our policy selection to be able to use words like system without going down the philosophy rabbit hole every time and just having a way that we can talk about systems of interest, like in dot coms, our system of interest is the stream."
"Unknown","00;57;24;07","00;57;46;12","So how do we take a role based approach that embodies the best of our values and uses the term system? And we also get all these other pieces too. So good. Thanks for sharing that, Yvonne. Dave shared a lot of interesting information about life and about some of the history of a few different ideas related to conceptualizations of life."
"Unknown","00;57;46;23","00;58;12;16","But the question that I wanted to get to was from Michelle NYC, who wrote How would you model this conversation using this model so that's a question we can think about and it speaks to almost like applying because online teams are certainly an application that's important for different kinds of modeling. And I'll give a first thought on this."
"Unknown","00;58;12;27","00;58;39;15","So one thing is when you said, how do we model it? The question's beautifully phrased because it doesn't say, Well, what does the theory say that this conversation is that's setting up for an absolute hegemonic realist answer? How would you model? It is going to be inherently different perspectives because different individuals and different years are going to have access to different tools and ideas and people."
"Unknown","00;58;39;22","00;59;14;19","So they're going to model this conversation differently. So that's the first piece, and that's moving from that sort of absolutist, modernist realism into more of a multi perspective level system. Now, what are some ways that one could model this? There could be a cyber physical depiction where one is very interested as we were in our 2020 that can at all paper in the information flows from a computational perspective like sense is the incoming states and actions or the outcome states."
"Unknown","00;59;15;00","00;59;48;21","So in the context of a video conversation there's an audio visual feed in and there's an audio visual going out so we could use blankets and interfaces and sense and action states to talk about just the cyber physical dimensions of the conversation. Another approach would be the hermeneutic or computational conversationalist approach, which Dave has connected back to a long lineage of work related to 1970s conversation theory."
"Unknown","00;59;49;00","01;00;20;29","And he wrote it provides a micro theory for nested mutual models focusing on the evolution and incorporation or rejection of predicates and their syntactic occurrence. Active inference work provides a corresponding needed macro theory focusing on secular evolution of the interchanges so one could have a communication oriented model that focuses on the semantics of the conversation. One could make also, as discussed at kind of a cyber physical, very computational model."
"Unknown","01;00;21;14","01;00;56;19","And there's other types of models that could be made. And then there's a million different implementations. So that's just the first pass. But it's a really important question, and it helps us connect the abstractions and the framework to the minor particulars, which are the system specific realizations that ground us in transdisciplinary and application. So, Stephen, and then any other questions from the live chat or blue yeah, I think they're quite useful questions those because that that question about how can I, I mean it ties into a couple of things."
"Unknown","01;00;57;14","01;01;45;11","My first interest would be say, OK, why would I? So there's some. But the other thing is how can I, how can I implicitly also link to is valuable to me what information is possible to interact with, you know, that idea of this so we can bring in we this morning process sort of ties us in this sort of middle ground between how we actually want to talk about all of this which I think is where the systems engineering is really useful because ultimately you kind of have to bring it into a system of externalize knowledge which can be then communicated and moved around as in the papers and other things that can be done."
"Unknown","01;01;45;29","01;02;10;27","But it also how can you start to understand. So the process is going on in the moment. So it could be measuring what we're doing in this real time process and someone tracking that it could be a case of video in it and watching back the video with an interpretation thereof. It could also be, you know, if we were wearing sensors, you know, there could be just trying to model the dynamics of us as things."
"Unknown","01;02;10;27","01;02;33;04","You know, I just trying to say, how could I know what I can even trying to feed into a system? So I mean, that one of the classic cases it's recently that Brian Smith, their work on interception, they had to devise a methods for recording first they did it with a hall and they changed the way the heart was measured."
"Unknown","01;02;33;04","01;02;54;06","But they also did some recordings of the stomach and the stomach region they had to find a way to get data to find out what could then be modeled. And was that a system they were modeling or was it almost the dynamic that they were modeling and of the things, you know, and I think that's I think and just seeing how the dynamics change over time."
"Unknown","01;02;54;20","01;03;23;12","And I think this is this is where maybe there's a lot of challenges that's going to be faced because we've had this conversation in this modeling world is, you know, jump in things into a system engineering world, which isn't only a non-OECD Olympian philosophical world. It's quite useful for applied work because it does that ability to make something a system in a way that's intentionally that and it has system of interest, just like Daniel was saying."
"Unknown","01;03;23;27","01;04;09;29","And then you've got but within that, our system of interest is about going beyond the systems of obvious presentation. You know, this stuff going on under the hood, which is not necessarily intuitively available at all. So I don't know what your thoughts on that, Daniel, but I think it's interesting. Yeah. The only short thing I'd say is like even if the system of interest, for example, is the mind of someone being educated for example, in the curriculum of Active Inference Lab or the audience who we're speaking to is our system of interest or even live stream, having your system of interest be the learner's mind or brain doesn't mean you're looking for the neuron level"
"Unknown","01;04;09;29","01;04;34;13","description. Having the system of interest to be the live stream or the audience doesn't mean that we need to know every single person or how video encoders work. So it's an application oriented approach, perhaps even an action oriented approach that cuts through some of these questions or sidesteps or saves them for savoring, you know, after the project has been completed."
"Unknown","01;04;34;13","01;05;12;07","Or after we've made the changes on the real world, it savors some of these truly excellent philosophical and important questions while also allowing us to act reasonably in the moment. And so it's always that North Star of a unified model of perception, cognition, and action that's so motivating. So even as some of the formalisms do evolve, we hope that we can respect the spirit and the inertia of the research that we've carried out and also know when we can marginally swap in new elements of the framework."
"Unknown","01;05;12;11","01;05;37;03","So blue. And then, of course, any questions in the live chat so as a modeler, how would I model this conversation? Really, like let's talk about how to really model it and not from a philosophical standpoint. Like if this is my model of the MVP, I have a model of the MVP that exists in my brain, as does Daniel Stephen Maxwell."
"Unknown","01;05;37;03","01;06;03;09","We all have a model of what the MVP looks like every time we read a paper, have a conversation, take input from. It's the action perception loop, right? My model exists in my internal states. Do my senses, I perceive, read, hear something that either confirms my model, provides evidence for my existing model, reduces my uncertainty about my existing model?"
"Unknown","01;06;03;20","01;06;25;11","So I have some evidence input through my senses. Then I update my model or if it doesn't jive or if it makes me realize something, I mean, always we're gaining information. So there's this epistemic value and through doing these conversations, these live streams, reading papers, having these discussions, et cetera. So my my model is updated through these conversations."
"Unknown","01;06;25;11","01;06;46;28","And then holistically we kind of come to a place where our models either converge through this communicative process on something that resembles each other's models. More similarly or not. Right. We might have this divergence and then we go away with like this uncertainty, like, is my model wrong? Or what was that argument about? I mean, everyone's been in conversations."
"Unknown","01;06;46;28","01;07;08;19","The discussions are heated scientific debates where you don't really come to a consensus. Right. There is no general agreement or understanding. And so then you walk away with maybe some maybe my models and valid and then do some what thought about it? I mean, that's how I would that's how I would model it. That's just me in the Vatican at all."
"Unknown","01;07;08;19","01;07;36;18","20, 20 paper with active inference in systems engineering systems thinking we use this font framework, formal documents, ontology narratives and tools. And so one kind of fun parallel or a way that conversation and the real dynamics that arise can be modeled in active inference is like agree to disagree. Two individuals can have high precision and convergence on a narrative inference."
"Unknown","01;07;36;29","01;08;05;28","We're agreeing to disagree. They can both be precise and agreed on that. And then at the first level they can literally disagree that's the whole point. So that is modeled in active inference as nested models, just like Maxwell brought up. And so we have nested models and the second order matrix can be the same between two agents, yet their first level matrix can be very different."
"Unknown","01;08;06;15","01;09;01;22","And none of those matrices are the system map territory. Mal Andrews active 14. So we've come back to these ideas and we'll continue to dance around them many, many times because they're so fundamental that sometimes they're hard to see play out. So Stephen and then anyone else yeah I think we have to be careful to note that it appears as if information act of inference tells APIs if knowledge is coming in and it's being we see it in our heads, so to speak, and yet the this conversation is, is where we would tune in through the action of our info niche or semantic niche of talking."
"Unknown","01;09;02;15","01;09;36;21","And we're aligning what our actions give us in our externality, be it through the diagrams, be it through this document, the slides or whatever the boundary objects are that we can align to given us partly due to our own folk psychology over the last hundred and 50 years. The sense and this is thing is really hard to counter this because this is kind of the way we tend to think that we have it in our mind's eye, so to speak."
"Unknown","01;09;37;02","01;10;06;21","So it's true, there's like this generative model, yet at the same time the generative model Lean is also part of what we're doing with generative. We modeling each other's conversation and getting a sense of how, I should say, my actions of words. None of those sentences were pre made in my head. You know, they it's an action policy that's close enough to my sense making so that it feels like I'm on the right track."
"Unknown","01;10;06;21","01;10;52;18","Right. And until someone looks at me really strange, this is a carry on. I've been in these conversations a few times or a bit or where how to keep going but I think that's something that's quite useful too when we talk about this. Modeling is all we're modeling the action policies that are externalized and our generative model is as good as it is at being able to enact through participatory sense, making what should happen next more than it is about having something that we've received in our generative model thanks Steven."
"Unknown","01;10;52;18","01;11;22;26","That speaks to the interaction EST versus instructional ism. Like is the FFP model that Blue was describing this generative model of the FFP that's in or embodied by all of us? Is it like a skyscraper made of glass and piping? And there's 90 degree angles or is it some other type of metaphor that or even transcending metaphor and only realized through certain sequences of interaction."
"Unknown","01;11;23;09","01;11;48;01","So that's really interesting and cool. Yeah, there's great comments. Dave's throwing some biblical references in the chat and someone wrote, I'm here first time in the livestream. It's so good to listen. All the cutting edge discussion about FFP, keep up the good work so nice work, Stephen and Blue, but thanks also for joining. You have tuned your regime of attention."
"Unknown","01;11;48;19","01;12;13;24","Hopefully you're having some questions and thoughts come to mind just as they are for us. We're just on the other side of the video chat window and the participatory sense making side and how to mobilize that and enact it. We can have participatory sense making with people on the video stream those who make asynchronous edits and improvements to these slides."
"Unknown","01;12;13;24","01;12;54;17","Like we still have to go through Blue's prior thoughts that were added to this slide deck and then from a history of science perspective and sociology, it's happening in a new way. One thing that was impressed on us, I guess months, two years ago, forever ago in crypto slash active was like the time scale of these discussions going from peer review and annual conferences in person and annual or multiannual cycles to like the pre-print and then we send a Twitter message to the author of the preprint Could you give a guest stream?"
"Unknown","01;12;55;01","01;13;21;14","And then the authors can respond like looking at what Maxwell wrote, which was very important or said, like Bayesian mechanics, that was Lifestream number 26. So we did a dot zero contextualizing video respecting that people have many different backgrounds approaching the work from. And then two of the commentaries, Bill and also Aguilar, are Yulara we're in stream number five and seven."
"Unknown","01;13;22;00","01;13;54;14","So it's like we've heard from many of the important perspectives and that's this participatory scientific sense making. We're all part of a bigger positive project that's transdisciplinary. It's not even just happening in the scientific literature, but it has to a large extent been because these are recent research advances, these are conceptual theoretical advances and now we're all learning by doing and increasingly doing and applying."
"Unknown","01;13;55;03","01;14;30;15","And so there's so much to learn and do so blue and then Stephen and then there's more great questions in the live chat. So go ahead. So you're like giving shout out to us, but I just want to like thank Daniel for all the scaffolding that he's provided in the active lab like to give us these kind of the baseline for these discussions to take place and also just to kind of go back to what Stephen was saying about, you know, about modeling and in acting really like I don't see knowledge as coming in."
"Unknown","01;14;30;21","01;15;01;22","Right. Like when I'm in that in the modeling sense, like I don't know that what you have is knowledge or what Daniel has is knowledge or what the paper contains is knowledge. All of that in my world is information. And I think that there's a difference between knowledge and information. And so like when I'm interpreting comments by Maxwell or Steven or Daniel, when I'm interpreting that I take that information and transform it through my model, right?"
"Unknown","01;15;01;23","01;15;21;22","Like so so some of like take it or leave it or take what you want from this discussion and it's always like that. I mean, we always do that whether people have to remind us to do it or not, right? Like you take away the parts that validate your model right? Or that improve upon your model or that you believe improve upon your model in some way."
"Unknown","01;15;22;00","01;15;44;26","So so then when I have it and I, I have transformed it, then maybe I can turn it into knowledge, but I don't see coming in anything coming in as knowledge. That's just me. And with video chat it becomes super real. Like when there's lag, all of a sudden it's like you're at the semantic level and then it's like, wait, just the syntax, I'm not hearing the words."
"Unknown","01;15;45;02","01;16;07;25","And so it's like we dip into this lower level and then imagine if the audio's working fine. You can totally hear non equilibrium steady state, but then conceptually what does that mean? So these nested and overlapping layers of meaning. So that's just very cool. So Stephen, and then there's a question in the chat yeah, this is a good point blue."
"Unknown","01;16;07;25","01;16;29;12","And I suppose there's also this sense that there's always got to be some belief in what you think the other person's saying like for instance, I believe the words mean X, Y, Z, because I know the English language I am through speaking in the language didn't know. So I believe this word means this I hear this word, these words together mean this."
"Unknown","01;16;29;23","01;16;59;02","So there's this, there's always and I'm hearing it, seeing it, I'm feeling it. The fact that my chair's comfortable changes things. Right? So there is this this sense that the you know, they talk about this in free energy prints, but it's like it can also appear like, you know, so things as well as there being in Bayesian inference, they can appear like there's a Bayesian inference type process, which is what's happening."
"Unknown","01;16;59;15","01;17;24;02","My models can be updated. And I think what I'm really interested in is for some of these things to then to be capitulated, there's knowledge I think there has to be and this is where the full rework comes in is we bring this into some sub conscious embodied, massive, well embodied practices which we can we tap into by sort of eliciting what they're like, maybe getting a metaphor."
"Unknown","01;17;24;02","01;17;53;20","It feels like the knowledge is coming from around me and I'm grabbing it. Some other people, it feels like it's coming in as a sea of very things. So my way of assembling the connections of my belief structure to the sensory information coming in, will capitulating, my modeling and as best I can, I'm going to be then trying to choose the way everyone else is."
"Unknown","01;17;53;20","01;18;13;08","And we're all, I'm sure would be different if we were all standing out during all of these talks. We might actually interpret and process a bit different food in a pool having a cocktail, you know, I don't know. I think blues on a stationary bike about half the time I have my stationary bike hidden out of view. But let's ask a question."
"Unknown","01;18;13;08","01;18;41;06","Yeah, exactly. We could do a ride stream. We could do a pool stream. But you got to come to my house. Cool. I remember that. So let's ask a question from the live chat. Then we'll return to some of Blue's previously phrased questions about the paper. And that's what's kind of fun. Like in The Zero, we get a lot of the details and the, the bulk of the paper and all the key ideas and figures if there are them."
"Unknown","01;18;41;16","01;19;13;10","And then in the top one, there's so many directions to go. And I remember early, it's like wait two times, 2 hours, group discussion on a paper. I'm used to academia, papers being discussed for one hour. If ever and people having very heterogeneous understandings or they did or didn't read the paper. So yet we find that there's always enough questions when we open the doors of the conversation to just like super fascinating direct directions for the discussion."
"Unknown","01;19;13;10","01;19;43;12","So again, we'll ask a great question in the chat and then we'll kind of turn to some of these one questions because next week hopefully we'll have one or both of the authors to be talking with. So Joseph wrote, How has active inference changed the way you view the world in daily life? That's a big question. Do either of you want to go first or I'm happy to go I can chip in."
"Unknown","01;19;43;12","01;20;17;10","If you go for one of the ways I've actually found it really helpful and I'd say is changing the way I think about how I see the world and also the things that I think about playing soccer. So the first one is there was there was this sense that, you know, I'm seeing the world who I am, and it's all a bit separate from me with active influence."
"Unknown","01;20;17;20","01;20;38;19","It can be quite nice to go out and think about actually perturbing the world and feeling the world as if you're feeling the world with your eyes closed. Touch touching the world with your hands, seeing the world and touching the world with your eyes. And I think that actually can help bring me out of my head, so to speak, in a metaphorical sense."
"Unknown","01;20;38;19","01;21;09;01","So I found that useful, actually, just thinking about that the world as being something that's out there and it's very much something I'm sensing. And so that takes a little bit of the modernistic kind of concreteness. And then with soccer as well, it made me realize I used to always think you see those things on telly, like, you know, like someone's kicking a ball, you know, like the equations bit like Terminator, you know, but now it's like, well, actually it's more like I'm just, I'm just getting whatever my feeling is, right?"
"Unknown","01;21;09;02","01;21;29;24","And that whole other stuff, it doesn't matter. So then you realize all these really great sports players, the really good ones actually there, they're actually, they've, they've, they've acclimatized a need for what it means to like methey must have this feeling for what it means to kick. It doesn't need to have the trajectory of the ball in its head anyway."
"Unknown","01;21;30;16","01;21;56;11","That helps us go through my crazy heads blue you want to go or if it's OK. So there's a few angles and this could definitely be a worthy topic for another discussion, but just to give a few angles. So first thinking how we view the world. That was a visual illusion in the original question. And so it reminds me of the development of thought from seeing the world."
"Unknown","01;21;56;24","01;22;24;17","That's the signal processing paradigm. Photons are pouring in and we're seeing categorizing classifying the world. OK, then we have predictive processing and that's like, well, you know, our visual field for most individuals, they see color in their entire visual field and there's equal clarity in their visual field. Even though there's an extremely heterogeneous distribution of resolution and color elements in the retina."
"Unknown","01;22;24;25","01;22;56;11","And we have a big old blind spot. So color clarity of vision and blind spot suggests that we're experiencing a generative model, a predictive model of vision that's predictive processing, and it applies also to other sensory modalities. And then that third step was where Stephen took it with the active vision that epistemic foraging. And we know that even though we don't directly experience these either, there's eyesight cards which move to the most informative part of the visual scene."
"Unknown","01;22;57;02","01;23;35;26","So to me, it's about moving from signal processing 1.0 to predictive processing to active sensing and exploration as informed by epistemic and pragmatic value together, you know, eyes on the ball, but you got to also see more than that, generate more than that. So that's one really important part. The second one, I'll also parallel exactly what Stephen said, which is like it made me think, even though I don't know about soccer, I don't know about the telly wrong continent, but it's kind of like the top down the video game model where there's like I see it more and more in sports replays where it's like it will pause and it will look like a video"
"Unknown","01;23;35;26","01;24;08;27","game. But that's not the action model of the player on the field. They're using much more of a personal flow and a feel and interactions and cues, and so they don't need to be having this 30,000 foot view. They need the very personal perspective. So that is one piece and then just want a third one. But I think another there's many more we could list would be like the reward oriented worldview."
"Unknown","01;24;09;13","01;24;44;06","So reward maximization is the paradigm. Reinforcement learning is how neurons associate. Utility maximization is what investing is about. In contrast with an uncertainty reduction paradigm, a precision optimization paradigm where qualified levels of precision of nested models allow a lot of flexibility and a lot more realistic phenomenology for different models because precision pursuits on an optimistic world model gets you utility."
"Unknown","01;24;44;15","01;25;05;18","So I just think we get utility from a precision first worldview, but from a utility oriented worldview, we don't always get precision. And that I personally connect to how if we have like a tetrahedral based geometry of nature, we get cubes, but if we start with cubic geometry, we never get tetrahedra. So that's sort of where I connect it."
"Unknown","01;25;05;18","01;25;46;13","Utility is like bigger and a more general framework because utility falls out of precision on an optimistic generative model. But merely having utility, it's always going to be ad hoc or secondary where just curiosity and epistemic gain and all these other features of real decision making. So those are a few of the key pieces, how it changes, how I've seen the world blue so besides from like having integrated fully into like my daily vocabulary which is like, you know, we talk about things like the generative model, like, you know, in completely unrelated offline conversations."
"Unknown","01;25;47;08","01;26;17;29","So aside from like you know, enhancing my vocabulary and building this new language of the MVP, which is that's weird, right? Like, OK, but aside from that, you know, one of the things, one of the recurrent themes for me in active inference has been the idea like we touched on it in the mental action paper that we did, like Daniel, you're going to have to pull the bullet up for me because I can remember you've got a better track."
"Unknown","01;26;17;29","01;26;40;16","You've got your model is updated and configured with all of the appropriate live stream, never more so than mine. It's 28, it's 28, and it's only because of my extended niche but continue. That's it. And so can you also clear your standard niche, because I can never remember the one where we talked about anxiety, like was it if it was Big Five or sophisticated active inference or I always ask what when that one was that?"
"Unknown","01;26;40;16","01;27;08;00","I kind of thought that was a long time ago. But, but going back, you know, touching on mental action and meditation and the idea that we touched on way in the long ago life stream of anxiety, representing, you know, trying to project too many time steps ahead into the future and having this relate to anxiety. And then like depression is relating to, you know, fixating too many steps in the past behind you."
"Unknown","01;27;08;00","01;27;30;17","Right. So this like model of like no typical things, it just always reminds me to come back to the present moment. And I'm looking for an excuse to do that anyway just because of my inclinations sort of Eastern religion and so forth. So but but the reminder to stay in the present moment has now been like made through an appeal to my logical brain, like outside of a spiritual sense."
"Unknown","01;27;30;17","01;27;57;05","And so that that kind of is, is a cool, you know, effect of, of active inference, I think. Awesome. There's so many fun questions in, in the chat. So I mean, I'll ask these and then we can, we can we'll still have time to return to the paper. So Mayhill asks, OK, one, if you were to let your imagination roam freely, where do you wish or see the best possible real life application?"
"Unknown","01;27;57;16","01;28;27;00","So for that question, that's a question for us and the community and beyond. So we can maybe each just mention one thought that we're having. But you know, if you see a possible future state active inference of X let's act in four surf, let's act first, update our models and serve and make the impact that we want to see."
"Unknown","01;28;27;00","01;29;14;18","So this is actually in affordance of a question because if two people are like, wow, we should do this, or could this be useful? If you can state it, you're like 90% of the way there. And we hope to develop the sort of transdisciplinary tools like active inference agents, software, and the Expertize tools, people and ideas and education, so that when somebody else who's not on this live stream, there's just three of us has that insight or sees it being applied in a new way, we want to help you scaffold that action trajectory but blue and then Steve so I guess I always come back to this to something that fascinates me fully is how"
"Unknown","01;29;14;18","01;29;32;11","information is integrated across scales. So how is the model of of my DNA strands input it into my cells and put it into my tissues and put it into my organs and put it into my sense of self? Right. So how does this and how do I import into the organisms that I'm part of, like the active inference lab and so forth?"
"Unknown","01;29;32;19","01;29;53;27","So for me, really like concretely realizing a mathematical way to find information passing up and down, like is it salience or what else, what other way? This emergence like for me that's like it like effective inference can nail that. And this is like a fantasy daydream. And I know people are working towards that, but it's out there in the future."
"Unknown","01;29;53;27","01;30;42;08","But, but if I could really wish one thing, if I could daydream about my ultimate fantasy of active inference being fulfilled, it's completely that. OK, awesome modeling nested biological systems, something that we've seen qualitatively discussed in the literature like Ramstad at all 2018 answering Schrodinger's question variational ecology, variational neuropathology, a lot of contributors to these works but that kind of a model with the epic Stephen yeah I'm really interested I think active influence it doesn't have to do everything to be really a contribution it can it can it can fill certain gaps as well or give certain mechanisms that can give an insight even to attractively give way to model or a way to just"
"Unknown","01;30;42;08","01;31;21;04","think about things so what I'm curious about and I'm working on something called conceptual action sociometry, which is a an action method. I'm trying to I'm really interested in how to work back from a high complexity context, which would be too many dimensions to model from first principles. So rather than modeling the generative model per say, I'm looking at how to create an instrument to track the info needs to be inscribed by the agent."
"Unknown","01;31;21;13","01;32;07;07","So it's almost like a trace. So I'm really interested in how we can go both ways. As well as the sort of general extractable sort of principled work that can be show how generative models are happening and being applied across things like context of autism and other areas where there's different types of classifications. I'm really interested in kind of contextual work which will be outside of the ability to do for research, but it might be to do an inquiry process and how to sort of just get a grip on that inquiry so people looking at their lived experiences and things like that."
"Unknown","01;32;07;07","01;32;50;23","And we're actually talking about that in the tools section. People are sort of giving me some advice or open to that once we get to the next phase. Awesome. Thanks for also sharing that. That I think the system just the one that I'll mention would be online teams or research knowledge inquiry and doing scholarship. And just at this point in time just facilitating the reduction of our uncertainty on the history of active inference and free energy principal literature and a few other areas because tools for research and sense making would be really awesome for a lot of different reasons."
"Unknown","01;32;51;02","01;33;21;25","So cool. And then the second question from the help in that sequence was what if we model our group conversation where we as humans disappear and where we are not exploring the universe, but the universe is exploring itself, utilizing us a beautiful thought question, and there's a lot to think about that. So Blue yeah. I mean, I think that this is possible, right?"
"Unknown","01;33;21;26","01;33;46;22","And you know, we've talked about it in the computational boundary of the self. The Mike Levin paper, like ultimately it's like dissolution of the cognitive boundary. And is there some like meta organism, this goes to the Gaia hypothesis, maybe not the universe, but the Earth, or maybe the earth is part of the universe. Maybe there's some ultimate like super organism that the cognitive boundary contains all of us."
"Unknown","01;33;47;02","01;34;12;17","And so just in the same way that like our cells are working towards our optimal function, given the circumstances that they're presented with right given that assumption, maybe we're also working toward the optimal state of the universe. Like every interaction that occurs between all of us is working toward the optimal state of the active inference lab or the optimal state of the United States of America, or the optimal state of, you know, scientific research or who knows?"
"Unknown","01;34;12;17","01;34;41;08","Right. So any kind of, you know, umbrella category that we might fall into, maybe we're serving the optimal state of that. And it's really like I think it's quite possible and a really cool way to model active in France for sure. Another take on that from Bucky Fuller is this function first mentality led him to ask, well, what is the function of human and are we local sense maker?"
"Unknown","01;34;41;08","01;35;05;22","What is our role? So those are big, important questions let's return to 31.1 and kind of prime ourself for our sport to because in the zero, that's where like whoever's really excited about the paper, maybe who ever contacted the authors or maybe one of the authors themself or just a few people who want to learn by doing the dot zero which was like blue and I for this one 31.1."
"Unknown","01;35;05;22","01;35;35;08","The previous video we go through the paper, the one we unpack, that's sort of the bathtub face. Everything's getting spread out a lot of sociological criticisms or insights, few random questions from the get from the guests of our stream. A lot of different areas a lot of threads get pulled out. And then in the too, we try to have some synthesis because it's not the end of the discussion with the data, but we have to move on from a live stream perspective."
"Unknown","01;35;35;08","01;36;00;08","So the data, especially when the authors can be there, we can get some more insights, we can resolve some questions that arose during the dot one and dot zero and the inter leaning times. So questions that didn't arise before we enacted this process and then we get to ask those and then kind of use that as our jumping off point as we move on to our next phase."
"Unknown","01;36;00;08","01;36;28;27","So here in the dot one at the ends it's kind of like a fractal dot two. We're kind of trying to tie a few things together, returning to the text as a strange attractor so that we'll have a whole week to read, think, sleep, stationary, bicycle, mind and body, relax, maybe do our day job if we can find any time and be here, you know, next week or whatever works to continue the discussion."
"Unknown","01;36;28;27","01;36;56;21","So blue in this questions for 31.1 what were some quotes or some questions from the paper that you wanted to like learn more about or ask the authors about? Well, just as I mentioned, you know, even earlier in this livestream today, like the dynamic equilibrium of living systems, like I'm not understanding that at all. Like maybe that's homeostasis but homeostasis is not in my mind that dynamic equilibrium."
"Unknown","01;36;56;21","01;37;31;09","And I think that this Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes and the idea of a non equilibrium steady state density kind of supersedes this concept of dynamic equilibrium because homeostasis is not equilibrium. And so that's kind of a fundamental hole like it like bends in my brain a little bit when I when I've been reading over this paper and also, you know, it says here we should pay closer attention to fundamental differences between physics and biology and how these differences interact with important concepts from physics into the modeling of biological targets."
"Unknown","01;37;31;18","01;37;51;11","So I mean, is it physics all the way down? Because I always thought it was physics all the way down, right? So I don't know. That goes to you know, like when I was in school, they always said, like, you know, biology is not as precise as chemistry and chemistry is not as precise as physics, and physics is not as precise as math."
"Unknown","01;37;51;22","01;38;16;11","Right? Like so there's this like tiered hierarchy of how fundamental your study can be, right? And so it I think biology is based in the concept of physics. But but also chemistry, I feel like was really a minute left out. And like in my heart, I'm a chemist, Steven. I'm sure you can relate to that. But really, like, so so that's kind of one other thing I wanted to explore."
"Unknown","01;38;16;11","01;38;37;28","And then the other part of, of of the questions that I have for the authors are, you know, in active inference, are the active states internal? Because they said internal states include active states. But I have always thought of active states and sensory states as part of the interface between internal and external states as part of the mark of LinkedIn."
"Unknown","01;38;37;28","01;38;59;05","So I just wanted to clear that up. Maybe if that's a misunderstanding on my part or I mean, I guess action can happen internally like as we've seen in the mental action. So that's definitely possible. But but not all active states are part of internal states. I thought so. I don't know. Maybe that's some something that we can tease apart with the authors."
"Unknown","01;38;59;05","01;39;22;27","And I'm looking forward to having them here and asking them these three questions, which are the ones that kind of for me don't align with my current model of the AVP. They were salient. They were different from your general models. That's a nice way to put it. And then I'll just show this one comic and then Steven. So this is a classical xkcd comic."
"Unknown","01;39;23;17","01;39;56;26","The field's arranged by purity. OK, so it's a comic. You know, retweets are not endorsements, but you have this is a classic disciplinary hierarchy slash Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme, whatever. You know, you have the physicists, let's just start in the middle. It's nice to be on top. That's the common pinnacle of the pyramid in certain paradigms. And then like the physicists can make claims about lower levels but then if the psychologist makes a claim about physics, hey, we need a sociology of molecules to be like, that's not science."
"Unknown","01;39;57;10","01;40;24;21","But then the physicists talking about social physics is like, wow, that's so modern and exciting. So there's a sort of linearity as well as potentially some sociological scaffolding that facilitates the diffusion of information and expertize and notoriety like one way, but it's not always a two way street. And then the joke, I guess, in the X case is like the mathematician saying, Hey, I didn't see you all from over here."
"Unknown","01;40;24;29","01;41;09;02","So again, just a comic now playing with the media, what does it look like to, I don't know, close the loop or have these learn about each other's perspective? Or there's a million ways that we could go counterfactual on this xkcd. What if I mean, that's the name of the city's author's book, which is kind of fun but how does active inference challenge this either specifically or just how are broader ongoing sequences of actions like decentralized science, DC Open Science, Open Access, Open Source, Global Collaboration, Transdisciplinary Application, in complexity science."
"Unknown","01;41;09;02","01;41;40;24","I mean, there's a million ways in which this is kind of funny because it speaks to an academic hierarchy and maybe we've even met some characters who really embody these archetypes, but what are the archetypes going to be going forward? What are more accessible archetypes and ones that are more true to form? And they can still be funny. I'm sure we'll have active memes just enough to warm the earth but this is just one view that's kind of speaks that disciplinary hierarchy."
"Unknown","01;41;40;24","01;42;08;07","So yes, even then, blue. Yeah. I think this this is where this foundational shift is, this this desire for purity starts has been really challenged. And of course now we're in this post normal science era where, you know, the reality is that we're going to have to make decisions and not just wait for the purity of the, the random control trial or whatever it is to make choices."
"Unknown","01;42;08;07","01;42;35;25","So how can we be more systematic and rigorous? And so then complexity comes in and the challenges that we are facing is that a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists have become have also gone down the purity route in a way that trying to like the idea of is they're all trying to be more pure and the mathematician can be more pure than the others."
"Unknown","01;42;35;25","01;43;09;00","But that question about being more pure, I think this is what Blue's points make a really good you know, they come into question like physics comes into question. Chemistry comes into question. When you talk about how far from equilibrium states, even the idea of it in in chemistry, they call it far from equilibrium chemistry in physics, they call it non everyone states, right, because they can actually math and the mathematicians would call loose ends attractive states."
"Unknown","01;43;09;00","01;43;29;28","Right. And but in either case, you only have to look at Levin's attractor. The whole point is you don't know where you are it. Right and and not in the same way is quantum well that's the question whether when you get into the fine details, we don't know yet. But it's still different to quantum. Right. And I think that's where that quantum contextthe reality comes in as well."
"Unknown","01;43;29;28","01;43;59;10","So. And what are your thoughts on that? The thing that just came to mind and blue is like this is a linear, right? It's open ended, but sociologists and philosophers make important insights about the philosophy and history of science. And so the mathematician can say Yeah, we're the most pure or we're the most correct or whatever it happens to be, but they're nested in a sociological context, in a historical and a philosophical context."
"Unknown","01;43;59;19","01;44;37;15","So it is closed from a causal closure perspective because it's not like physics has just broken out of the frameworks of thought. So how to move this line into a conversation that's including all of these disciplines in a trance discipline and including people who aren't in academia or research in that as well. Live so this is an interesting comic and I usually like don't even talk about psychologists or sociologists because that's not science right now."
"Unknown","01;44;37;16","01;45;02;22","I'm just kidding. I really actually have a lot of respect for psychology and sociology, but it's just not something that's ever been like lumped into my pyramid before. So thank you for sharing that and seeing it in this way. Like, maybe they should arrange by like the fundamental any of it, like sociology without like social interaction. We would not develop things like mathematics, right?"
"Unknown","01;45;02;22","01;45;27;27","Like there would be no need. So so in terms of what's more fundamental, like maybe sociology is fundamental and psychology, like we're not even thinking about what makes us work if we're not psychologically OK, right? Like we're in a bad psychological state. Nobody's thinking about interest cells and DNA. Like that's there's just no you have to have like the fundamental needs have to be met before you start to ponder things like what am I made of and how do my parts work?"
"Unknown","01;45;27;27","01;45;49;05","Right. And really like so so maybe in terms of fundamental fundamentally and then we are biology and then, you know, so maybe in terms of the fundamental things, sociology is the pinnacle of that. And again, there's probably many ways in which different perspectives or act of inference can challenge this or at least kind of continue this joke a little bit."
"Unknown","01;45;49;16","01;46;21;16","But it's like pure act of inference. It's really about sociological context we really have a mathematical formalism. It's really grounded in the ways that people have been studying physics. That's one of the questions of 31. The paper is to what extent is it, has it, could it been grounded in physics? But we really have physics and we really are talking about biology and for comprehensiveness and, and getting to the fundamentals, it is really fundamentally relational."
"Unknown","01;46;22;14","01;46;48;08","So we're not taking this redux Zionist purity spiral. We're taking like a transdisciplinary purity and we're just saying this is our keyword. And to really get at what we're talking about, we're really going to respect all of these perspectives. So that's kind of a funny challenge that you wouldn't necessarily hear arising from a disciplinary conversation. So Stephen, go for it."
"Unknown","01;46;49;00","01;47;19;18","Yeah, I think this is also one thing. You know, we say though that we see the importance of social interaction, social inference, and the challenge is that I think actually this might be quite appropriate where we had at the beginning with Maxwell's conversation is the perspective of the sociologists becomes what is ascribed to social interactions. You know, the psychologists is what's described in the mental models that we have in our heads."
"Unknown","01;47;19;29","01;47;49;17","The biologists describe in the categories. The chemist is describing the steady state, you know, so when you get into this agent based modeling, which again I think is more familiar to the newer work in biology, but it's something that I had to start to learn about, you know, and looking at these dynamics and modeling actually starts there and it starts to go on the grounds of all of these."
"Unknown","01;47;50;08","01;48;20;18","It doesn't make them invalid because they they they are useful when you can take a perspective on the systemic work that we're not taking perspectives in this and this, that's the whole grounds starts to become shifting. And that's really interesting. OK, here's another kind of a subtlety, actually. So sociologists OK, just starting there, that's our prior, you know, d coming in from the left, sociology as applied psychology."
"Unknown","01;48;20;19","01;48;46;07","OK, so we're going all the way, you know, chemistry is applied physics. It's just like it's interesting. The conversation is going that way. I'm just seeing another comic where it could have been like physics is applied math. Chemistry is applied physics. Like who is saying which field is an application of which other fields so there's a lot of ways that conversation could play out."
"Unknown","01;48;46;21","01;49;30;01","And by imagining the counterfactuals, the semantic, the rhetorical counterfactuals and then asking, well, what is concordant or just concordant with our generative model and why, that's a very rich starting point for transdisciplinary discussions because the whole entire meta transdisciplinary discussion, it's been decades, centuries truly with different words. So how are we going to look at this with a new light and maybe even integrate some of the truly recent developments in tools like performance computing and interactive notebooks and ontologies?"
"Unknown","01;49;30;12","01;49;57;27","These didn't exist. One or 200 years ago in the same way they do today. So how are we going to respect qualitative and quantitative and different backgrounds, recognizing that we're never going to get the end of the story? Even if you got 100 PhDs in any one of these fields or lived a hundred years in a field outside of academia, you still wouldn't be at the end so how are we going to take a radically different approach to learning and applying?"
"Unknown","01;49;58;23","01;50;42;09","Maybe active inference could have something to do with it. So in the last few minutes, anyone else in the live chat could just ask a final question. Otherwise, let's just sort of recap. The big aims and claims of this paper were about the foundations in statistical physics and dynamical systems theory for the free energy principle and what's on the line, what's on the table for whether the theoretical underpinnings are adequate or not for an active well, it's the practical utility as well as the theoretical adequacy so that's what matters."
"Unknown","01;50;43;21","01;51;29;18","They claim that their work is starting to fill in this gap. And whether we think that there's any, any other pebbles in that gap or the gap is, you know, a meter across or a kilometer across, there is a differential and we can all positively contribute to that through discourse and through contributions to literature. And then the main argument of the paper and one of the big ideas that'll be really cool to talk about is that the foundations in physics allow the models to be maximally general to describe across systems but in the author's words, these assumptions also decrease the ability of FFP models to include enough factors to provide biologically plausible represents options for"
"Unknown","01;51;29;18","01;51;53;10","living systems and the way that they are in the world. So, you know, big idea, physical and physics, grounding of FFP and what that says about the theoretical adequacy as well as the practical utility, and then this idea of generalization and if we over generalize do we sort of leave behind some of the features that we wanted to explain in the first place?"
"Unknown","01;51;53;26","01;52;14;25","So that's a little bit of the recap. And I'll just pull to our kind of closing slide and ask these questions. And then Steven in blue, you can give a last thought. What would a good understanding enable what are the unique predictions and the implications of this research or of what you thought of after learning about this research?"
"Unknown","01;52;15;14","01;52;49;09","What are the next steps for FFP and active inference? What are the goals of this or your research? And then what are you still curious about? What is your intrinsic motivation that's going to keep you reading these papers and contributing to the discussion? So Stephen or Blue, any last thoughts? Stephen First, and then I think in terms of this paper anyway, I think that this really does highlight this need to understand the difference between particles voxels things, systems."
"Unknown","01;52;49;09","01;53;22;16","I think this because these types of critiques keep coming up. I at times I know it's has a risk of kind of tying the free energy principle community in some knots. And so I think that it's a challenge and I think that that that may be part of where this goes. And at the same time, I think it's a good provocation and the there is some questions here about how and why those confusions arise."
"Unknown","01;53;22;16","01;53;54;16","And so I think that might be you know, I'm curious about learning more about that because I think that's going to help in other ways in doing this work. Thank you, Stephen Blue, so it's awesome to me. I think that talking about the general, General Generalizability, sorry that didn't come out well the generalizability and applicability of like the the free energy principle, I really like that."
"Unknown","01;53;54;16","01;54;31;24","That's also like a tradeoff between like epistemic and pragmatic value. Like it reminds me of that balance that we see in the RFP. And so I think like the ultimate goal is to resolve that, like how do we strike the balance between epistemic and pragmatic value? How do we strike that balance between generalization and application? Great point. We want to describe many systems and describe them well and walk in with a scaffold, but minimal constraining priors that prevent us from seeing some fundamental or even essential attributes of systems."
"Unknown","01;54;32;06","01;55;00;09","And then that general and specific connecting that to learning and doing to epistemic and pragmatic values or gains which content we have included in the active formalism as part of our policy selection approach. So Stephen and Blue Plus everybody who asked truly excellent questions in live stream, we'll see you in an organizational unit meeting or the Discord or some other way."
"Unknown","01;55;00;10","01;55;08;26","Just this is your audience to participate and contribute. So thanks again to everybody and we'll see you next time. Bye."
