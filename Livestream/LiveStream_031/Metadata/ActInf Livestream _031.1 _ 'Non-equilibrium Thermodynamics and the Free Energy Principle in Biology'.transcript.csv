"Speaker 1","00;00;08;00","00;00;39;08","Hello and welcome everyone to act in five live stream number 31.1. Yes, we are live so today it's October 19th 2021 and we're going to be having a discussion on the paper non equilibrium thermodynamics and the free energy principle in biology. So welcome to the Active Inference Lab everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;00;39;22","00;01;01;17","You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for lectures. At this short link, you can see the past and upcoming live streams."
"Speaker 1","00;01;01;21","00;01;23;01","Here we are at the end of October 2021 in paper number 31 and today we're going to be having an awesome group discussion and then next week we hope to have one or both of the authors join us. So we'll be taking a lot of notes today and bringing up good things to talk with them on. And all of these are participatory live streams."
"Speaker 1","00;01;23;01","00;01;51;24","So if you want to join or if you want to co-organized with us, just let us know. Today in 31.1, we're just going to be learning and discussing this paper of Palacios and Colombo, and we're just putting out some perspective, giving some affordances for others to join in and hopefully learning along the way. So we have a few questions that Blue and others have prepared."
"Speaker 1","00;01;52;10","00;02;26;10","Maxwell also prepared some notes to talk about, and we're just pretty much going to look through the questions that we have already written up. We'll add more. Anyone in the YouTube live chat who wants to ask a question? They're more than welcome to do so, and we'll just hop around wherever we need to go. We'll start off with the introductions, so we'll just say hi and maybe something that we liked about the paper or something that stuck with us or something that brought us to this conversation."
"Speaker 1","00;02;26;17","00;02;55;15","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I think something I'm excited about today maybe would be to look at this intersection of biology and thermodynamics and talk a little bit about the different ways we can approach that intersection. This paper has some formalisms, but not all the Formalisms. There weren't figures, but there's so many graphical intuitions related to free energy landscapes and some other pieces."
"Speaker 1","00;02;55;15","00;03;06;08","So it just kind of cool to think about what are the different ways that we come to learn about the intersections of these cool ideas. And I'll pass to Steven Hello."
"Speaker 2","00;03;06;08","00;03;38;07","Yes, Steven, I'm in Toronto in Canada. I'm pleased to be here again, and I'm interested in this paper. The General topic of this city comes up and I'm interested to see I often see these papers which have sort of free energy principle focused rather than say, active inference focus so just to see how in that when that tree gets shaken, how that helps or hinders the sort of more process theory work, which is probably closer to where I'm interested in."
"Speaker 2","00;03;38;07","00;03;42;20","But this is all very interesting. Thanks. I'll pass it over to Maxwell."
"Speaker 3","00;03;43;21","00;04;14;07","And Maxwell Ramstad. I'm the CEO of Nested Minds Network and active in Friends I Startup and I a fellow at the Center for Human Neuroimaging UCL in London. I'm I'm looking forward to discussing this paper. I think there's a lot to disagree with and I'll try to be collegial in my criticism."
"Speaker 1","00;04;15;12","00;04;49;06","Beautiful. What more could we ask for? Let's start with the big question and of course other of you if you have a different take or there's other big questions. But this big question, which is in this paper as well as the broader literature, what fundamental ideas from physics are utilized in free energy principle and active inference? And how and just what are the implications or trade offs associated with the use of this idea?"
"Speaker 1","00;04;49;17","00;05;18;23","Does it lend credibility to a theory to be grounded in physics? What does it mean to a theory for it to be grounded in a certain physical idea? Does it constrain pain? Does it prevent us from making the kinds of conclusions that we might want to draw about biological systems? So that's kind of the big question do either of you have any other sort of big questions that this raises, or what is the alignment of the vector of this paper?"
"Speaker 1","00;05;19;01","00;05;23;00","With the bigger ongoing threads in our research community?"
"Speaker 3","00;05;24;29","00;05;51;22","Well, I mean, I guess one outstanding question for me is what is the horizon a relevant literature in terms of time course that one needs to consider before trying to engage with and criticize this material it's something that comes up. I think it might be useful to discuss."
"Speaker 1","00;05;54;13","00;06;28;26","Maybe before we go into the specifics there, just when we're engaging in interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary scholarship or we're diving into fields where we might not have taken courses to the undergraduate or higher level, just it's a really important question how do we make appropriate claims? You know, how do you take a little bit of a of a dip into the rabbit hole and come out with something that's useful rather than just being more confused than when you made the initial search?"
"Speaker 1","00;06;29;08","00;06;44;14","So these are big questions. Any thoughts or just how do we determine what literature are relevant? Like if we wanted to write a paper on something related to active inference or just in general, what do we do? Do we do keywords? Do we only look at the last five years."
"Speaker 3","00;06;48;03","00;06;51;03","Are you asking the question rhetorically or do you want us to chime in?"
"Speaker 1","00;06;51;19","00;07;01;28","Maybe Stephen first with the reason, but then just either I mean, Stephen, I don't. Yes, Stephen unmute and then continue."
"Speaker 2","00;07;03;20","00;07;41;25","I'm probably not the best person because I keep digging and digging and digging, but I think it's a good question. I'm from a chemistry background, a long way back, and I always find it interesting as well because, you know, a lot of stuff that's used is or developed comes from chemistry actually and uses physics. But you know, the night you say that we're in this kind of need to approximate and an approximation, like there's so many things that come up that are like new, new ways of describing stuff, which makes total sense."
"Speaker 2","00;07;41;25","00;08;17;03","Like I've read through the free energy principle and Kristen's work about the talk about approximation science and that science is ultimately an approximation. And then, you know, it takes me a couple of days to then get my head around that. And it's like, yeah, that totally makes sense. But the implications of all of that are huge. The implications of being in non equilibrium states itself disrupts a lot of the accuracy of, of certain ways that you can roll out things from physics and how you roll it out into chemistry, which is normally equilibrium chemistry."
"Speaker 2","00;08;17;24","00;08;53;03","I we roll in our straight into biology or we roll it out into something slightly different with all this modeling. So I think it does cause some challenges in terms of discussions because it's easy for other people to start telling the free energy principle and active inference community what they are and then start telling them and framing what they're not and by which point it's kind of hard to have a discussion because it's like the straw man's been set up."
"Speaker 2","00;08;54;10","00;09;22;13","And I think that can be a little bit challenging for some conversations to move forward, because now you've got a complex idea trying to, first of all, counter the fact that other people's paradigms have been challenged. So I think that itself, I don't know if that's a literature thing or whether that's a cognitive thing, but I think that that is part of the challenge that seems to be faced I agree."
"Speaker 1","00;09;22;13","00;09;43;00","Stephen, thanks for that. And it's maybe a good segue way. Maxwell, we can just start to hear some of your thoughts and I'll be typing some notes and maybe asking some follow ups and unpacking because I know you have a lot to say on this, so maybe just go for it and I'll just type along and we'll see where we go."
"Speaker 3","00;09;43;04","00;10;17;10","I mean, I guess that probably the thing that I find most puzzling about the paper is that it claims to be the first in the literature, essentially to be looking at the connection between the physics of the free energy physics and the free energy principle. And I find this puzzling because it seems to me that the connection between physics and the free energy principle has been really maybe thus thus focus of active research in our community for like four years or so."
"Speaker 3","00;10;19;05","00;11;06;13","So, I mean, you know, the Carl published or at least preprinted, his particular physics monograph in January 2019. And you know, prior to that we had all been working on, I mean effectively the connections, the physics of I find this problematic because the work that we're going to discuss today focuses on, you know, older formulations of the free energy principle where the connections to physics were maybe less obvious I mean, as most of us in the community know now, the formal foundations of the free energy principle been subject to extensive debate over the last three years or so."
"Speaker 3","00;11;08;13","00;11;38;18","Kind of Martin Beal and colleagues kind of started, started, started us off in this direction. And, you know, since March and, you know, a few other groups have produced, you know, and stimulated interesting discussions through their very interesting and technically rigorous critiques of the free energy principle. But really, it seems to me that this has been a focus of our discussions for the last several years, the connections, the physics and so on."
"Speaker 3","00;11;40;10","00;12;33;04","And where this has gotten us is the Bayesian Mechanics for Stationary Processes, paper that was recently released which accounts for the critical remarks that have been raised. And, you know, so really where we're at now is that we have formulations that start from non equilibrium statistical mechanics and information geometry and, and, you know, saying well all systems that have stationary density dynamics and a march blanket will look as if their internal states are modeling in a loose sense or in a more technical sense encoding the parameters of probability distributions or Bayesian beliefs about external states."
"Speaker 3","00;12;33;08","00;13;00;09","That's sort of where we're left with. And you get that, you get to this from the physics. So I just found that the, the remark was a bit puzzling and the choice of literature was also, I think, a little puzzling for the, the same reasons. I mean, I have more specific thoughts, but I mean, this is sort of for your first bullet point in response to the last one that we had."
"Speaker 3","00;13;00;09","00;13;34;28","And what's the relevant time horizon? I feel like a rapidly developing theory, like the active inference framework and the free energy principle. I mean, if you're going to be producing technical critical material, you should probably be working from the most recent versions. I mean, I find it puzzling, for instance, that the authors spend so much time talking about airgood this city when the word ergodic doesn't appear or just just about never appears in the particular physics monograph."
"Speaker 3","00;13;35;07","00;14;03;14","So anyway, I just find that there's a kind of disconnect between what's presented here and the actual work on the physics of the free energy principle that that we have seen. And I think that leads to several of the arguments being proposed, being a bit missing their mark, to put it diplomatically."
"Speaker 1","00;14;05;00","00;14;10;11","Thank you for the concise summary, Maxwell. So Steven with a hand and then we'll continue."
"Speaker 2","00;14;13;20","00;14;44;18","Could I ask a little question as well as it relates to this is in the very first part of the abstract, it talks about the inevitable, an emergent property of any exotic random dynamical system that non-nuclear steady state possesses a mark of blanket. So that's a quote from the paper in 2013. The thing is it says before that according to the free energy principle, life is an in and then it quotes inevitable and emergent property which is the quote."
"Speaker 2","00;14;44;18","00;15;12;17","But I'm not sure that life is ever talked of as an inevitable an emergent property of any event a got it random dynamical system in terms of how it's referenced. And I'm wondering if there's a bit of a confusion in the paper there where it talks about this that quote but makes it as if that's what life that life is an emergent and an emergent property."
"Speaker 2","00;15;12;17","00;15;36;04","And I think it's I think what we're talking about is adaptive reduction of surprise or Bayesian inference properties is an inevitable an emergent property. But I don't know if that would be life. I don't know what your thoughts are on that or whether I'm misreading that."
"Speaker 1","00;15;37;10","00;16;07;21","That reminds me of one of my favorite papers. What is life answering Schrodinger's question by Maxwell at all in 2018? Because maybe you could even say something to this. What is the relationship between reducing surprise and life? And do these recent technical developments in FFP help bridge the gap between inanimate and living cognitive or computational processes? And where does physics play into that."
"Speaker 3","00;16;10;28","00;16;51;16","That's very interesting. I mean, I think the the FFP itself is not a theory of life just in and of itself. Right. What is what it is? It's a theory to understand systems that are able to maintain themselves in non equilibrium regime effectively so or I mean more precisely stationary systems with a blanket, which is to say the same according to the theory so I've gone on the record as saying that the free energy principle can allow us to construct a theory of life."
"Speaker 3","00;16;53;00","00;17;33;21","But the claim isn't just that the free energy principle in and of itself allows you to do that. I think, you know, the FFP needs to appeal to auxiliary hypotheses from biological and other sciences to really do that. I mean it's a theory of things ness in physical systems that interest us and a subclass of those systems, our biological systems so I mean, it is an aid in the formulation and probably the foundation of a formulation of living systems."
"Speaker 3","00;17;33;25","00;17;56;18","So so long as we agree that living systems are a subclass of persisting systems. And I mean, there's some talk in this paper that maybe this persistence living systems of systems might not be the right way to think about life. But yeah, I think it acts as a foundation. I mean, but then you need to add a lot more to turn that into a theory of life."
"Speaker 3","00;17;56;18","00;18;31;00","I mean, if you read my Schrodinger paper carefully, for example, what we propose is a variational approach to neuropathology we're not saying that the free energy principle in and of itself can just alter the it's like the three energy principle have two uses. It has to be used as a foundation from which you can build these variational approaches to neuropathology, the misconstruction to ecology or what have you so I mean, you know, that that might just be picking it, nit picking."
"Speaker 3","00;18;31;00","00;18;36;17","So like I well, I don't want to double down on that too much."
"Speaker 1","00;18;38;06","00;19;13;27","It's good points and it's almost related to the definition or the distinction between like a discipline and a trans discipline. If FFP is a discipline versus if it's connecting other disciplines, variational neuropathology, it's right there in the title, we're connecting across different areas and the framework of thinking this is one of those enabling features that helps it be an integrative theory, but potentially it doesn't fulfill the disciplinary uses of theory."
"Speaker 1","00;19;13;27","00;19;40;11","So that's one interesting idea because there's many other ways to go with things to ask. I guess I'm just I'm curious again, like Maxwell, what do you think in the last few years, how have we clarified or learns more about where active inference and FFP are related to each other? So how was that thought of in five years ago?"
"Speaker 1","00;19;40;13","00;19;53;15","Maybe when you were in grad school? And then what do you think is sort of contemporary greetings, Blum, in terms of the distinction between active inference and FFP and then I'll conclude you can add anything you'd like."
"Speaker 3","00;19;54;03","00;20;19;27","And I know some people want to mark the difference between the two. I think personally, I think it's more of a sociological thing because no one or just about no one is contesting the validity of active inference models of cognitive systems but there's a lot of pressure from different circles on the free energy formulation. So I mean, it might be a sociological thing where it's just easier to say, Oh, I don't work on this more."
"Speaker 3","00;20;20;03","00;20;37;16","You know, metaphysics sounding saying, I just work on computational neuroscience. That's straightforward. I think there's no warrant for that. From a mathematical point of view, you should just, for example, look at the way that things are derived in the Bayesian Mechanics paper."
"Speaker 3","00;20;40;16","00;21;20;08","Yeah, I feel like active inference just falls out of the the core Bayesian mechanics. I mean, I'd recommend everyone to read through that Bayesian Mechanics paper. It's really fantastic. It's very clear one of the big differences between it and previous three energy papers is that it's authored by or at least there are two authors out of the four on the paper who are proper mathematicians working on the mathematics of non equilibrium statistical mechanics effectively."
"Speaker 3","00;21;20;08","00;22;03;25","So, you know, that paper really I think meets the standards of rigor in mathematics. You know, you have an existence proof for the synchronization manifold that's sort of at the core of the whole formal construct, the thing that links internal and external states, and then you have a construction of it. I mean, it's very straightforward and having having established, you know, the kind of core formal apparatus it's unfolding and by the end, you know, you what you do is as kind of well all right, let's split the blanket states up into sensory and active states."
"Speaker 3","00;22;04;09","00;22;42;22","And active inference just falls out of making the active states subject to the dynamics that are unfolded throughout the paper. So in my view, the connection is immediate yeah. I will grant that, you know, some of the computational models that we're using are a bit more they look a lot more like just vanilla you know, computational neuroscience model you know, their ponds and stuff like that."
"Speaker 3","00;22;42;22","00;22;54;17","But but what the math that underwrites it all is the math of the free energy principle. So I don't really I don't really think the two can be separated."
"Speaker 1","00;22;55;29","00;23;10;21","Thanks, Maxwell. And the Basic Mechanics paper, we discussed in livestream number 26. So it's, it is a lot to keep up with sometimes, but that was a very fascinating discussion. So blue and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;23;12;10","00;23;15;24","I was wondering if that was Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes, the one we did."
"Speaker 3","00;23;15;24","00;23;17;09","Yeah, that's precisely it. Yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;23;18;05","00;23;40;29","So I sorry I'm late on the scene, but I'm curious about whether is there a theory of life or does it allow us to construct one and does it only apply to life or can we take it in this kind of psychic direction where even molecules like one to minimize the free energy and self-assemble to become structures?"
"Speaker 3","00;23;41;22","00;24;02;17","That's a very good question. I would say that the free energy principle is not a metaphysics so it's it's a physics. So it's the formal framework that may or may not give us a grip on the systems that we're interested in."
"Speaker 3","00;24;04;26","00;24;32;08","So, I mean, you know, I and I know there is some philosophical literature that presents it as more like, you know, a metaphysical statement about what life is but I think it's more useful to think about the Bayesian mechanics is just an extension of mechanics effectively. You know, the the same way that, you know, statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics are flavors of mechanics."
"Speaker 3","00;24;32;08","00;25;02;14","The Bayesian mechanics is also, you know, and I realize that it's a little deflationary. It's a more instrumentalist reading of the free energy principle, but it's not completely deflationary in the sense that it the model says that the best model of living and other existing systems is as a model of their environment. So, you know, there's a kind of double instrumental ism at play, I think in the free energy stuff."
"Speaker 3","00;25;04;19","00;25;15;04","To answer your question a bit more directly, I think it is it can be the can be used to construct the theory of life in and of itself. It's a theory of being yes."
"Speaker 3","00;25;18;06","00;25;49;12","Yeah. It's a great set of questions to discuss. And I mean, this is only my view. Like, I don't mean to settle this once and for all. There are people who want to defend a more metaphysical view on this I guess the question is how far do you want to take the commitments of the free energy principle? I mean, you know, there are kind of two irreducible assumptions that go into the now there's stationary, which, by the way, is not the same as Air City."
"Speaker 3","00;25;50;01","00;26;41;11","So, you know, I think the whole section of this argument just doesn't apply at all anymore. The one presented by Columbia and Palacios and Mark of Blanket so I mean, you know, if if you think that, you know, systems that exist at some scale have to be stationary and you think that, you know, systems that exist really do have a mark of a blanket then you can be realist about the assumptions but I kind of feel that it works whether or not you take the additional philosophical step of committing hard core to the realist assumption you know, it works just as it works as an, you know, an as if theory, if you will, I"
"Speaker 3","00;26;41;11","00;27;15;03","mean, the whole thing tells you like living systems that existed on a non equilibrium steady state. It how and how the mark all blanket will look as if they're inferring external states and I mean yeah I think this this looks as if stuff is really important. And I realize that, you know, for some of us it may be a little bit deflationary but I don't know if more is warranted from the math."
"Speaker 3","00;27;15;03","00;27;21;27","I think that there's a yeah, we just need to be kind of careful."
"Speaker 1","00;27;26;06","00;27;36;12","Thanks for identifying those two key pieces and maybe we'll have more to think about with the stationary in the city. So blue with the raise your hand. And then Steve."
"Speaker 4","00;27;38;20","00;28;04;03","So just a couple of things. Like when I say plants like ism, I wasn't trying to go into the metaphysical realm, but because it's physics, because it's not metaphysics can it then apply to life and non life? Like, can we just go all the way down? Yes. And so in that kind of way, I wasn't really implying as metaphysical constructs, but more in like the direct, does it broadly apply to non-life as well as life?"
"Speaker 4","00;28;04;11","00;28;23;08","Yeah. And then also just a couple more things. So systems have a Markov blanket like Maxwell. That's you being entirely realist. Like I don't have a Markov like it, but can I be modeled with Markov? Like it? Probably so. So I don't, I don't know, like, you know, I don't curl up in my Marco blanket at night when I go to bed, but."
"Speaker 3","00;28;23;12","00;28;24;06","It's comfy."
"Speaker 4","00;28;26;22","00;28;49;12","And then just lastly, like going back to the paper, this like so I don't know, that was one of the main questions that I have for the authors is this concept of they say like systems are in dynamic equilibrium. Like, I don't think that the non equilibrium steady state density is the same as dynamic equilibrium at all. And that was one of the main questions that I raised."
"Speaker 4","00;28;49;12","00;29;01;05","And like dynamic equilibrium really is not it's a chemical process, like a reversible chemical reaction so I don't I really kind of miss that. That was one of the key things in the paper that I just didn't understand at all."
"Speaker 3","00;29;01;15","00;29;26;12","Yeah, I, I mean I, I very much agree with you on the points that you're saying, the price that you're raising here. So I mean regarding the Penn psych ism thing, I mean yeah, you can from physics now kind of say that any system that exists kind of looks as if it has a mind. Then you might not want to go full on the metaphysics of science like ism, but it certainly warrants that kind of claim."
"Speaker 3","00;29;26;19","00;29;53;24","I mean, in my view, this paper is making a few critical mistakes, and this is echoed a lot in, you know, a lot of the literature coming from more like for people writing about this, I'm just going to cite, you know, two sentences from a paper reprinted this year I won't I won't name names, but you'll see the style of what I mean to be as fair as possible."
"Speaker 3","00;29;53;24","00;30;44;18","We'll do this as in criticized the SEP. But then these are the more recent published versions and variants of these claims. And then the next section starts literally the next sentence the work presented in first in 2013 is central to practically all the proposals comparing the CEP and an action and it just goes on and stuff and it's I sort of feel like the physics foundation has moved forward like blue you're pointing it out it's all about non equilibrium steady states and a non equilibrium steady state dynamics and stationary that's importantly different from this city you know the well the nice things about the Bayesian Mechanics paper is that it abstracts away from those assumptions."
"Speaker 3","00;30;44;18","00;31;20;07","I mean to be clear, the free energy principle at its core never really required that the systems that you study be ergodic we assume. And regarding density in some of the earlier publications because it allows us to finesse one step in the derivation, substituting the time average for the ensemble average. And one of the really core derivations, you know, as Carl himself had been pointing out for a long time, you could finesse the math into you know, something else."
"Speaker 3","00;31;20;07","00;31;46;27","Like there's no reason why you have to stick with the Ergodic assumption. It was used just in this one step of the derivation and you know, Lance de Costa and Greg, probably Otis and Company have done in this Bayesian Mechanics paper with Carl is precisely to do the laborious work of actually generalizing the math to non ergodic systems."
"Speaker 3","00;31;46;27","00;32;14;27","So I mean, I think that's really important. The Bayesian Mechanics paper, we're in discussions with the people, active discussions that the people who produce the critical material and I mean at this point, I think everyone essentially agrees that Lance's new derivations respond to the critiques by Aguilera and colleagues that came out earlier this year and also the bill."
"Speaker 3","00;32;14;27","00;32;40;07","It all critique. Remember, the core of the bill at all critique is that for you processes in general of the sort that Carl was using you can't assume that the synchronization manifold will exist between the internal and external states. In fact, that Martin and company have showed is the for a generic due process. You Kansas it does not exist."
"Speaker 3","00;32;42;03","00;33;15;00","But you know that that doesn't mean that you can find very broad conditions under which the synchronization manifold exists. And that's what Lance and company have done in this new paper again is critique it all. This is the Sussex Group also did a very interesting analysis of the math doesn't figure it in the particular physics paper showing that actually the the precise assumptions that Carl uses in the paper would restrict the scope of the CEP to a rather narrow class of systems."
"Speaker 3","00;33;15;00","00;33;37;06","But again, let's just re derived all of the equations. So the formalism is now effectively different. And what you can really see from the math is that it applies to nonlinear systems and to non ergodic systems. And this leads me to another point. I think the assumption of non equilibrium steady state is often not understood in the way that it should."
"Speaker 3","00;33;37;27","00;34;09;01","The non equilibrium steady state is a characterization of the density dynamics. It is not a characterization of the system itself. If I if I say that a system is that non equilibrium steady state, I'm not saying that it is steadily in some state, you know that it just that it occupy what I'm saying is that the probability landscape that underwrites its dynamics is stationary or has stopped evolving those are two very, very, very different claims."
"Speaker 3","00;34;09;09","00;34;49;06","So it doesn't follow from the fact that a system has a density that it is history lists. It doesn't follow from, you know, the, the existence of the next density, that there should only be one attractor. Like you can have a stability in an RFP system, you can have Non-linearity in an RFP system, you can have non aggregate the city in an RFP system, so yeah, I mean, I think, you know, that means that one of the three sections, the critical sections in this paper are just completely off the mark."
"Speaker 3","00;34;50;00","00;35;31;28","And, you know, there's this new paper based by some of the tenders of the inactive approach on precisely this kind of stuff as well. And unfortunately, the same mistakes are made ergo this city in the context of the I mean, really just means the, the, the, the, the quantities that you're observing are measurable it means that, you know, on the average of your measures converges on average to a measure of the average or of the mean that you're actually trying to calculate in accuracy expense."
"Speaker 3","00;35;32;28","00;36;16;06","So it never meant that systems don't have a history. It never meant that systems necessarily converge on one attracting set. And so I really feel that that kind of takes the teeth out of most of the formal criticism in this paper. The other part of the the other critical parts of this paper talk about, you know, the challenges of modeling by biological systems using state spaces, but that those sections to me don't amount to much more than just saying it would be very difficult to do this therefore it's not doable or something like that."
"Speaker 3","00;36;16;17","00;36;40;13","And, you know, I, I have a lot of friends who are computational biologists and I speak to a lot of people doing this and it's sort of like, well, you know, some work would have to be done to write a paper to respond to this. But, you know, what's the expression? One person's modus tolerance is another person's modest modus ponents or like, you know, I sort of feel like, all right, well, you know, you say this is impossible."
"Speaker 3","00;36;41;10","00;37;07;06","I know that formally. You know, Alex Alex Chen is a really cool guy and he's brilliant. He and the ethics team have recently, recently, I mean, this is two years old, so it's not that recently. And I feel like this should be accounted for in this paper, but have recently automated state space construction in the free energy framework."
"Speaker 3","00;37;07;07","00;37;53;16","Like we have active inference models now that can kind of automatically assemble and can handle up to it's either 10,000 or a million states. So, you know, that's a lot of modeling power. And I find the example that they discuss in the footnote there, however, this is on page 11. However, the size of the genotype space for a protein consisting of ten residues chosen from an alphabet of amino acids the size and the and and then they say oh well you know it's like 20 to the 100 or ten to the 130 possible states if you wanted to model like you know, amino acids what they're not considering is the nested formulation and I kind of"
"Speaker 3","00;37;53;16","00;38;24;03","feel like nested nested densities should have been at the core of this argument and figure nowhere yeah. I mean of course if you think that you can just plot all of the states of the system across all the scales at which it exists in one homogenous state space, you're going to run into a problem but you're not. If you carefully construct these states spaces in a kind of nested fashion, you know, like a friend of mine, then the tower works on."
"Speaker 3","00;38;24;15","00;38;59;15","I pulled this paper up. He has a really cool preprint, a deep learning approach to capture the essence of Candida albicans, morphologies. And I mean basically their what they do is start with a population of Candida which is a fungus for those of you who don't know. And then you you just randomly generate a CRISPR and you introduce it into the population and you see how the population develops and you plot each population trajectory in a 30,000 parameter hyper parameter space effectively."
"Speaker 3","00;38;59;23","00;39;31;22","And you see the way that the Candida self-organize into pockets depending on their, you know, the kind of procedures that you put into them. I mean, this is not like fringe work. This is just routine computational biology where we're already plotting phenotypic expression and 30,000 dimensional spaces, you know, this isn't like forthcoming work to be done. I mean, it's really just standard work."
"Speaker 3","00;39;31;22","00;40;13;27","It's interesting how you know, I think they modified the paper. We had discussed this in a livestream before and they nicely added some responses to some of the criticisms that I raise in discussion I'd have to pull it up. But, you know, I said, well, you know, we're using this stuff in studies of cancer dynamics. And, you know, like so I wrote in the paper, you know, we can think of a biological systems extended phenotype as the set of extracting attracting states of a couple of dynamical system."
"Speaker 3","00;40;13;27","00;40;53;22","And this is supported by studies of cancer, genesis and propagation I can link the papers and they say, well, you know, these studies provide evidence that cancer can be fruitfully modeled and understood as an attractor and a dynamical system, but they don't provide us with evidence that all biological systems occupy in the tractor. And I'm sort of thinking like, well, no, but, you know, this is a counterexample to you're saying that it's not doable in a real biological system, you know, so, you know, if I if I'm being snarky, I feel like this is armchair biology of the worst kind kind of you're telling me that what I'm doing is impossible while I'm doing it."
"Speaker 3","00;40;54;26","00;41;26;21","And, you know, and you're doing it by appealing to, like, you know, an old conception of the physics, by talking about assumptions that aren't even part of the formalism anymore. I mean, I just I find that there's a lot to object to in this paper, both in terms of the substance and in terms of the general kind of strategy of kind of gotcha in now, does the free energy principle need to be discussed critically?"
"Speaker 3","00;41;26;29","00;42;05;15","Absolutely. And, you know, I should have caveated all this by saying that some of the most interesting and stimulating intellectual exchanges that I've had in my life have been with the people creating critical material but, you know, the the people that are generating this interesting critical material are actually engaging with the theory at its formal core. And, you know, I sort of feel like some of these things would have just been cleared up with you know, a few conversations and looking at the more recent material."
"Speaker 3","00;42;05;15","00;42;09;10","But now I feel like I'm just kvetching at this point."
"Speaker 1","00;42;10;28","00;42;21;06","Thank you, Maxwell. That's what these discussions are for and hopefully bringing into the open. It's just about my perspective. Well, just to give you."
"Speaker 3","00;42;21;18","00;43;01;01","To give you like a specific idea why this is problematic, like if you focus on the city and not on the nested densities, then you're going to say things like, well, first you have to show that there's an attractor and then you have to show that the relaxation time is biologically plausible. And they claim that neither of these things are done in the free energy literature when literally, you know, the core 40, 50 pages of Karl's physics monograph deal with and you know, Dan, I know we've read it all together during the last year like I don't know how you how they could have missed this I mean it's the physics monograph this is supposed"
"Speaker 3","00;43;01;01","00;43;44;29","to be their topic. The core of the physics monograph is all about you know information links effectively right. And relaxation times back to non equilibrium steady state and how all these things kind of work in a nested way to get you biological dynamics. So it seems to me like they are just completely missing their target by both by, you know, working out on formulations that are out of date and that introduce assumptions that are no longer at play and also by just really ignoring, you know, the physics stuff the free energy physics stuff that they claim to be criticizing you know."
"Speaker 1","00;43;45;22","00;44;00;14","So we need to be just like if we were going to catch a baseball, we need to be performing anticipatory knowledge work, not merely reactive especially to previous formats."
"Speaker 3","00;44;00;26","00;44;26;04","And then if it's reactive, I mean, you know, react to the recent stuff. I mean, you know, there's been a concerted effort to ground this in the physics of non equilibrium systems like non equilibrium, statistical mechanics, information geometry, I mean if you're going to be writing a criticism of that stuff, then you should probably be writing about that stuff is sort of my point."
"Speaker 3","00;44;26;21","00;44;51;14","And and by the way, this often goes really badly when I point out that, hey, you know, you're, you're working from a, you know, an outdated thing. They say, oh, you know, there's free energy version 25 from this morning and blah blah blah. But I kind of feel like, you know, my friend, if you want to write a criticism of something like you should be as charitable as possible with the target of your criticism on the one hand."
"Speaker 3","00;44;51;21","00;45;07;25","And you should definitely not be working on versions of this that no one in the community is still working on. And there is a dimension of like, if you can't keep up, then I don't know, you know, I don't know who benefits from this is sort of like my, my questioning is like."
"Speaker 1","00;45;09;20","00;45;12;15","OK so Stephen and then blew."
"Speaker 2","00;45;14;14","00;45;40;25","Yeah I think thanks for giving us a good, good insight there. I think the psych the sociological psychological piece is is present in all of this, as you say. And I think I've mentioned this before to Max, what actually is the danger of systems to most systems? I think even if you were talking to people in the International Society of Systems Sciences, they often talk about systems, system dynamics and everything else."
"Speaker 2","00;45;40;25","00;46;03;16","Things, complex systems kind of gets lumped into complex two, right? So there's a danger because I don't think Carl necessarily would say FFP system, right? And that term system I think gets you into a lot of challenges because the folk psychology of what a system is, is what we see as from the outside. And, you know, these non equilibrium statistics."
"Speaker 2","00;46;03;16","00;46;19;21","I'm wondering whether we say ma, he says blankets all the way up and down, but I'm not sure if it's more like thinking this all the way up and down is safer than systems all the way up and down because things can have all sorts of you know, and they can have states and they can be what they are."
"Speaker 2","00;46;20;00","00;46;39;13","And the question really becomes then within all that, oh, good, this is he, which unlike physics, which tends to be about getting things to a certain number of decimal points of accuracy, and it's a messy thing. You know, I assume that that thing about approximation science, I mean, again, that gets your head around what that, that makes suddenly you got."
"Speaker 2","00;46;39;13","00;47;07;09","Well, the main thing is you just need enough of whatever this stationary extractable data is to be able to do something with it. And I'm kind of thinking that may be because in the same way that in chemistry, if you have a beaker and you stir it up and basically the thing will have its dynamics it will move based on the energy between the different things."
"Speaker 2","00;47;07;17","00;47;37;04","And basically entropy is just basically the, the force that's pushing it in the way that you don't expect it to. Exactly. You know, we know it does this from this equilibrium state. We knows that entropy is just the thing in the middle. Now, no one has a bloody clue what's why. It's just a black box right now. But that's because they go from now when you go to these non equilibrium fall from equilibrium, chemistry state, they're held, which you don't do."
"Speaker 2","00;47;37;04","00;48;00;29","When you mix up a, B can just go from A to B. Now we don't know how many non equilibrium states these reactions go through, to be honest in those cases now. But you wouldn't call the beaker a system, you call it a solution, you'd call it a you know, you might call the vessel and the chemical plant in which it reacts a system, but you just sort it kind of a beaker of stuff or things."
"Speaker 2","00;48;01;08","00;48;24;00","This doing stuff and things, right? And then you sort of see what it does and then it's like, what can we do that's useful? And normally what's useful is what energy shifts, but in this case you've also saying the entropy can be useful, but not in the way most people would. The what we could say, the folk systems thinkers would kind of tend to think about it."
"Speaker 2","00;48;24;00","00;48;29;10","So I'm just wondering if there's a danger of using the word system. Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;48;29;19","00;49;04;01","I would agree. I mean, I think we use the term system just because, you know, all of this grows out of dynamic systems theory in some sense. You know, Paul talks of particles, right? Like a, a, a a system with them are called blanket. And those are the three energy stuff is a particle in his account. So yeah, there is a so there's a there's a linguistic danger here because I agree with you, this is not what people think of when they hear the word system."
"Speaker 3","00;49;04;01","00;49;49;23","A lot of our senses, as you pointed out, season have turned around that specific point. I think the term is important because especially in the context of relating the 50 to like the four E approaches, I think it's not appreciated sufficiently that the math is what happens if you take dynamical systems theory seriously. You know so when I was doing my undergrad I was reading the four E guys and the 40 people this is not just guy and the 40 people were telling me, all right, well you know computer theory, you only get so far in the study of cognition you have to do dynamical systems, learn the math and learn the physics of complex"
"Speaker 3","00;49;49;23","00;50;16;24","systems. So I did and several of us did but what happens is then if you continue asking questions along that direction, things arise like, well, how do you measure distances between states and if you start asking that kind of question, inevitably information and entropy creep back into the picture because that's how you measure distances between states effectively is in."
"Speaker 3","00;50;16;24","00;50;49;05","That's another information theoretic unit. So I mean, this is to me, the great irony of this whole, you know, versus in activism confrontation, which is slowly turning into like one of the big discussions in contemporary philosophy is I don't think that the 40 people fully appreciate that the FFP stuff is just a prolongation of their thinking style, that if you, if you really want to take seriously the core tenets of embodied cognition, then inevitably you are led back to information."
"Speaker 3","00;50;50;07","00;51;00;27","There's no escape it's really if you want to take their own framework seriously, there's no other place to go. But here I unfortunately have to leave now."
"Speaker 1","00;51;00;27","00;51;01;21","Thank you, Maxwell."
"Speaker 3","00;51;02;07","00;51;25;19","Thank you for listening to me rant about this. I'll try to be there next week. And yeah, I mean, keep kicking ass. I mean, Dan Blue I just love active and friends love and I'm so grateful for the awesome work that you do keeping this community alive. Stephen, it's always a pleasure to talk with you, and I'm glad to see that there is so much."
"Speaker 3","00;51;27;08","00;51;47;18","So much. Yeah. You're just there all the time, and I just love your you know, your contributions to the conversation. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. So a big love to everyone. And I will be in touch shortly. Apologies for the snarkiness. This is just, you know, the thing this is the kind of paper that really grinds my gear."
"Speaker 3","00;51;48;03","00;51;53;28","And I what it was it was good to just point out a few of what I think are the issues."
"Speaker 1","00;51;54;22","00;51;57;04","Thank you, Maxwell. See you soon."
"Speaker 3","00;51;58;02","00;51;58;14","Goodbye."
"Speaker 1","00;52;00;05","00;52;35;07","This bullet will go to you. But this is a you know, it's a key difference between being an organizer and a facilitator or a participant. We're here to help scaffold individuals to participate and their perspectives, and that's the second order cybernetics. So things will get more contentious than we can even imagine. And someone just has to hold down the broadcasting, make sure that hands are being raised and that protocol is being respected because there are serious first level questions to resolve."
"Speaker 1","00;52;35;24","00;52;43;09","But we can have precision in our second level policy and that's going to return to a question in the live chat. But first, blue with the raised hand."
"Speaker 4","00;52;43;09","00;53;11;06","Thank you so I just wanted to say that a lot of what both Maxwell was saying and what Steven said just really underscores the need for consistent definitions, like how do we define a system? And also like a consistent synthesis of the RFP like historically where did it start, where has it been, where is it going? And like where are the landmarks?"
"Speaker 4","00;53;11;06","00;53;26;17","Like, for example, this basic Bayesian mechanics for stationary processes paper, you know, has revamped the math and physics. And when we're making a new paper or a new argument, are we working with the current version of the model?"
"Speaker 1","00;53;28;04","00;53;56;16","Absolutely. Nice foreshadowing of some work that we're involved in. But if anyone is interested in sort of scholarship and a history from an empirical perspective on FFP and active, they should get in touch with Blue or AI because this is a project that we're super keen on, but it's a very important point. And that's why in our zero we had like this slide with the active inference lab, the working ontology."
"Speaker 1","00;53;56;16","00;54;26;15","So we're going in a participatory way and we're working through these terms and we're finding where it's quoted in the literature, how it's used in the literature, and then we're adding notes and relevant resources and we'll be developing curriculum that helps make simple declarative uses of these terms so that we don't get lost. And we'll have the terms and we'll have the specifics of literature, and it'll be an awesome environment for learning applying and communicating act of inference."
"Speaker 1","00;54;26;26","00;54;30;10","So before Stephen, you want to go with the question and then we'll go to the live chat."
"Speaker 2","00;54;31;24","00;55;09;27","Well, I'll just add to that point you just made is I think it is really going to be important because we've seen the confusions that can happen, but also it's likely that there's going to be a kind of a multi ontology. There might be something in this whole field that speaks to how this changes just in the way the cow Fiston talks about when something is regimes to an info max focus versus a Hamilton this action focus versus, you know, rewards focus."
"Speaker 2","00;55;09;27","00;55;46;18","So there may well be this commonality and there may also be a way to process when things systems particles become, you know, derivations. And you know, that's going to be interesting because there may be some nexus whether it's called metaphysics or whether it's something more profound, you know, less less out there. Maybe it can be grounded. And I think that that starts to come up as we we hit, you know, that's transdisciplinary for you."
"Speaker 2","00;55;46;18","00;56;07;05","Right. Is going to you're going to want to know what's in the discipline piece. So maybe there will be stuff which is kind of grounded in the biology world and grounded in the physics world. And he's going to talk as best it can, the language. Right. And then there's going to be stuff which is in the applied world, which ultimately starts to go transdisciplinary at some point."
"Speaker 2","00;56;07;05","00;56;14;14","As soon as you get out and get to any sort of scale so I think that's going to be very, very interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;56;14;25","00;56;44;09","Awesome. And both Stephen and Blue and many others join US Weekly in dot edu where we talk about this. So let me read a few of the awesome comments from the live chat and ask a question from the live chat and anyone else can continue to ask a question. So there's a lot of discussion on the systems question and Yvonne said, Maxwell, subscribe to our systems thinking course we will discuss what the system is from the standpoint of systems engineering."
"Speaker 1","00;56;44;20","00;57;23;22","So that's really important. Thanks, Yvonne, for sharing that. And indeed two of the fundamental pillars or ontologies or trans disciplines of active inference lab are active inference and systems engineering. So those are the perspectives that we draw on and seek synthesis and application of, and we're all learning a lot and it will be updating our generative model in a way that changes our policy selection to be able to use words like system without going down the philosophy rabbit hole every time and just having a way that we can talk about systems of interest like in dot coms, our system of interest is the live stream."
"Speaker 1","00;57;24;04","00;57;46;08","So how do we take a role based approach that embodies the best of our values and uses the term system? And we also get all these other pieces too. So good. Thanks for sharing that, Yvonne. Dave shared a lot of interesting information about life and about some of the history of a few different ideas related to Conceptualizations of life."
"Speaker 1","00;57;46;20","00;58;12;13","But the question that I wanted to get to was from Michael NYC, who wrote How would you model this conversation using this model so that's a question we can think about and it speaks to almost like applying, because online teams are certainly an application that's important for different kinds of modeling. And I'll give the first thought on this."
"Speaker 1","00;58;12;24","00;58;39;13","So one thing is when you said, how do we model it? The question is beautifully phrased because it doesn't say, Well, what does the theory say that this conversation is that's setting up for an absolute hegemonic realist answer how would you model? It is going to be inherently different perspectives because different individuals and different years are going to have access to different tools and ideas and people."
"Speaker 1","00;58;39;19","00;59;14;16","So they're going to model this conversation differently. So that's the first piece, and that's moving from that sort of absolutist, modernist realism into more of a multi perspective whole system. Now, what are some ways that one could model this? There could be a cyber physical depiction where one is very interested as we were in our 2020 that can at all paper in the information flows from a computational perspective like sense is the incoming states and actions are the outcome states."
"Speaker 1","00;59;14;26","00;59;48;18","So in the context of a video conversation there's an audio visual feed in and there's an audio visual going out so we could use blankets and interfaces and sense and action states to talk about just the cyber physical dimensions of the conversation. Another approach would be the hermeneutic or computational conversationalist approach, which Dave has connected back to a long lineage of work related to 1970s conversation theory."
"Speaker 1","00;59;48;27","01;00;20;26","And he wrote It provides a micro theory for nested mutual models focusing on the evolution and incorporation or rejection of predicates and their syntactic occurrence. Active inference work provides a corresponding needed macro theory focusing on secular evolution of the interchanges so one could have a communication oriented model that focuses on the semantics of the conversation. One could make also, as discussed, kind of a cyber physical, very computational model."
"Speaker 1","01;00;21;12","01;00;47;04","And there's other types of models that could be made. And then there's a million different implements versions. So that's just the first pass. But it's a really important question, and it helps us connect the abstractions and the framework to them. I particulars, which are the system specific realizations that ground us in transdisciplinary and application. So Stephen and then any other questions from the live chat or blue?"
"Speaker 2","01;00;49;02","01;01;33;12","Yeah, I think they're quite useful questions those because that that question about how can I, I mean it ties into a couple of things. My first interest would be say, OK, why would I? So there's some but the other thing is how can I, how can I implicitly also link to is valuable to me what information is possible to interact with you know that idea of this so we can bring in this model in process sort of ties us in this sort of middle ground between how we actually want to talk about all of this, which I think is where the systems engineering is really useful because ultimately you kind of have to bring it"
"Speaker 2","01;01;33;12","01;02;02;03","into a system of externalized knowledge which can be then communicated and moved around as in the papers and other things that can be done. But it also how can you start to understand. So the process is going on in the moment. So it could be measuring what we're doing in this real time process and someone tracking that. It could be a case of video in it and watching back the video with an interpretation thereof."
"Speaker 2","01;02;02;10","01;02;30;18","It could also be you know, if we were wearing sensors, you know, they could be just trying to model the dynamics of us as things. You know, this I'm just trying to say with how could I know what I can even trying to feed into a system. So I mean that one of the classic cases, it's recently that Brian Smith their work on interception they had to devise a methods for recording first."
"Speaker 2","01;02;30;18","01;02;54;02","They did it with a hall and they changed the way the heart was measured. But they also did some recordings of the stomach and the stomach region. They had to find a way to get data to find out what could then be modeled and was that a system they were modeling or was it almost the dynamics they were modeling and of the things, you know, and I think that's I think and just seeing how the dynamics change over time."
"Speaker 2","01;02;54;16","01;03;23;10","And I think this is this is where maybe there's a lot of challenges that's going to be faced because we've had this conversation in this modeling world is, you know, jump in things into a system engineering world, which isn't only in non-OECD Olympian philosophical world. It's quite useful for applied work because it does that ability to make something a system in a way that's intentionally that and it has system of interest just like Daniel was saying."
"Speaker 2","01;03;23;24","01;03;46;29","And then you've got but within that our system of interest is about going beyond the systems of obvious presentation. You know, there's stuff going on under the hood which is not necessarily intuitively available at all. So I don't know what your thoughts on that, Daniel, but I think it's interesting."
"Speaker 1","01;03;47;16","01;04;19;09","Yeah. The only short thing I'd say is like even if the system of interest for example, is the mind of someone being educated, for example, in the curriculum of Active Inference Lab or the audience who we're speaking to is our system of interest or even live stream. Having your system of interest be the learner's mind or brain doesn't mean you're looking for the neuron level description having the system of interest to be the live stream or the audience doesn't mean that we need to know every single person or how video encoders work."
"Speaker 1","01;04;20;00","01;04;47;09","So it's an application oriented approach, perhaps even an action oriented approach that cuts through some of these questions or sidesteps or saves them for savoring, you know, after the project has been completed, after we've made the changes on the real world, it savors some of these truly excellent philosophical and important questions while also allowing us to act reasonably in the moment."
"Speaker 1","01;04;47;24","01;05;13;03","And so it's always that North Star of a unified model of perception, cognition and action that's so motivating. So even as some of the formalisms do evolve we hope that we can respect the spirit and the inertia of the research that we've carried out and also know when we can manually swap in new elements of the framework. So blue."
"Speaker 1","01;05;13;10","01;05;15;03","And then, of course, any questions in the live chat."
"Speaker 4","01;05;17;04","01;05;47;10","So as a modeler, how would I model this conversation? Really like let's talk about how to really model it and not from a philosophical standpoint. Like if this is my model of the app, I have a model of the app that exists in my brain, as does Daniel Steven Maxwell. We all have a model of what the MVP looks like every time we read a paper, have a conversation, take input from it's the action perception loop, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;05;47;10","01;06;14;01","My model exists in my internal states through my senses. I perceive, read, hear something that either confirms my model, provides evidence for my existing model, reduces my uncertainty about my existing model. So I have some evidence input through my senses. Then I update my model or if it doesn't jive or if it makes me realize something. I mean, always we're gaining information."
"Speaker 4","01;06;14;07","01;06;43;05","So there's this epistemic value add through doing these conversations, these livestreams, reading papers, having these discussions, et cetera. So my my model is updated through these conversations and then holistic we kind of come to a place where our models either converge through this communicative process on something that resembles each other's models more similarly or not. Right. We might have this divergence and then we go away with like this uncertainty, like, is my model wrong?"
"Speaker 4","01;06;43;05","01;07;05;07","Or what was that argument about? I mean, everyone's been in conversation these are discussions or heated scientific debates where you don't really come to a consensus, right? There is no general agreement or understanding and so then you walk away with maybe some maybe my models and valid and then do some more thought about it. I mean, that's how I would that's how I would model it."
"Speaker 4","01;07;05;14","01;07;06;00","That's just me."
"Speaker 1","01;07;06;17","01;07;36;14","In the Vatican at all. 20, 20 paper with active inference and systems engineering systems thinking we use this font framework formal documents, ontology narratives and tools. And so one kind of fun parallel or a way that conversation and the real dynamics that arise can be modeled in active inference is like agree to disagree. Two individuals can have high precision and convergence on a narrative inference."
"Speaker 1","01;07;36;26","01;08;05;26","We're agreeing to disagree. They can both be precise and agreed on that. And then at the first level they can literally disagree. That's the whole point. So that is modeled in active inference as nested models, just like Maxwell brought up and so we have nested models and the second order matrix can be the same between two agents, yet their first level matrix can be very different."
"Speaker 1","01;08;06;12","01;08;26;26","And none of those matrices are the system map territory. Mal Andrews active 14. So we've come back to these ideas and we'll continue to dance around them many, many times because they're so fundamental that sometimes they're hard to see play out so Stephen and then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;08;29;01","01;09;23;17","Yeah I think we have to be careful to note that it appears as if information act of inference tells APIs if knowledge is coming in and it's being we see it in our heads, so to speak, and yet the this conversation is, is we're we're in tune in through the action of our info niche or semantic niche of talking and we're aligning what our actions give us in our externality, be it through the diagrams, be it through this document, the slides or whatever the boundary objects are that we can align to given us partly due to our own folk psychology over the last hundred and 50 years."
"Speaker 2","01;09;23;28","01;09;55;15","The sense and this is thing is really hard to counter this because this is kind of the way we tend to think that we have it in our mind's eye, so to speak. So it's true. There's like this generative model, yet at the same time the generative model Eden is also part of what we're doing with genuine simply modeling each other's conversation and getting a sense of how, I should say, my actions of words."
"Speaker 2","01;09;56;02","01;10;15;29","None of those sentences were pre made in my head. You know, they it's an action policy that's close enough to my sense making so that it feels like I'm on the right track right. And until someone looks at me very strange, this is a carry on. And I've been in these conversations a few times before where how to keep going."
"Speaker 2","01;10;16;01","01;10;49;15","I but I think that's something that's quite useful too, when we talk about this. Modeling is all we're modeling the action policies that are externalized and our generative model is as good as it is at being able to enact it through participatory sense, making what should happen next more than it is about having something that we've received in our generative model."
"Speaker 1","01;10;51;20","01;11;22;23","Thanks, Steven. That speaks to the interaction EST versus instructional ism. Like is the FFP model that Blue is describing this generative model of the FFP that's in or embodied by all of us? Is it like a skyscraper made of glass and piping? And there's 90 degree angles or is it some other type of metaphor that or even transcending metaphor and only realized through certain sequences of interaction."
"Speaker 1","01;11;23;07","01;11;47;28","So that's really interesting and cool. Yeah, there's great comments. Dave's thrown some biblical references in the chat and someone wrote, I'm here first time in the livestream. It's so good to listen all the cutting edge discussion about FFP, keep up the good work. So nice work, Stephen and Blue, but thanks also for joining. You have tuned your regime of attention."
"Speaker 1","01;11;48;16","01;11;52;17","Hopefully you're having some questions and thoughts come."
