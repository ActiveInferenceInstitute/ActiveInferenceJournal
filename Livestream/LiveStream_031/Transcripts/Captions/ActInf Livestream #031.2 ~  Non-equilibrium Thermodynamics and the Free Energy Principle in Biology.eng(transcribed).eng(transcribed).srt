00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
hello everybody and welcome to the

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
active inference lab today it's october

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
26th 2021

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,359
and we're in active live stream number

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,840
31.2

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
welcome to the actimf lab we are a

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
at the links here on this slide

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,760
this is a recorded an archived live

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
feedback so that we can improve our work

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,719
welcome here and we'll be following good

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,680
video etiquette for live streams

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
we're here in our second discussion

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
group discussion for 31 towards the end

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
of october so also happy halloween

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
and this is our jumping off point to

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,199
many ideas so looking forward to this

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,039
cool discussion

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,319
the goal is going to be to learn and

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,438
discuss

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,840
this paper by patricia palacios and

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
matteo colombo both of whom are with us

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
today so thanks so much to the authors

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
for joining and

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
feel free to address what you can while

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
you're here and then just leave whenever

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
works for you

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
and in this discussion we can

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
take it many different ways because so

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
many topics came up in the dot zero and

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,360
dot one but we have all of the

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
formalisms some big questions a lot of

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,119
topics that we raised in the 31.1 video

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
as well

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
so we can begin with an introduction and

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
warm-up section we'll have the

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,840
non-authors introduce themselves and

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
then just say hello and then we'll pass

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
to the two authors both of whom are

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
joining for the first time to a stream

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
so again thanks for

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
joining and we look forward to the

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
discussion

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
california

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,360
and to just add something i'm excited

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
about matteo and i were just discussing

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,000
right before we started some of the

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,119
sociology meets history and philosophy

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,440
of science

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,879
and oh yeah who could forget about the

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,120
actual topics themselves so there's just

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,800
some cool intersections that we'll be

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,319
able to talk about

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
i'll pass it to dave

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
i'm retired from information technology

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
i'm in the cool dry mountains of the

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
northern philippines

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
and now that i don't have to work for a

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,959
living i'm getting really busy on

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
learning cybernetics which is when one

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,760
of the things i did back in college and

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
having a great time is fired up about

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
having a complexity weekend ramp up

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
starting tomorrow

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,920
sojourn stephen

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
we can't hear you steven but you're

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
unmuted so maybe your audio

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
selection is odd

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
but let's um

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
welcome steven back so figure it out and

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
let's go to um patricia first welcome

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
and happy to hear your introduction

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
hello well thank you for for the

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,000
discussion for

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,879
for the interest in discussing our paper

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
so i'm an assistant professor in

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
salzburg i'm originally from chile

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
and i work in the philosophy of physics

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,000
philosophy of science

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,159
and now i'm working more and more in the

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
philosophy of the complexity science

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
and i have done some work on going to

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,640
physics

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
and

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
well i'm interested in general in the in

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
the statistical mechanical applications

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,360
to other disciplines um well

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
statistical mechanical models

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
in economics biology

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
and well chemistry although i haven't

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
explored that already

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
yet i'm interested on that

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,599
and

99
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,159
with mateo was my i did my first

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,920
exploration in the free energy principle

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,239
but um just to be clear i'm very

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,599
interested in the application of

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519
statistical mechanics to other

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,280
disciplines even if we appear to be

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
critical to that in this in this paper

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
thank you matteo

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,918
thank you very much for uh

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
the kind invitation and also for the

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
spotlight uh on our paper completely

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,560
undeserved

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
my name is matteo colombo

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,680
i'm based in tilburg in the netherlands

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
uh as my accent might suggest i'm

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,360
italian i'm originally from milan and

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
mostly my work lies in the philosophy of

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
cognitive science i have a special

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
interest in computational modeling

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
especially reinforcement learning and

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
bayesian approaches

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
uh to brain function

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
and

122
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,040
you know it's been fun

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
to collaborate with patricia at this

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
project which um you know combined a

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
bunch of interest already had and helped

126
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,440
me to learn something new

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
great well maybe we could just start

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,320
with

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
some of the context of the paper like

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
how did both of you

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
intersect towards this very

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,639
interesting view on fep and active so

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
were you studying active inference and

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
then wanted to integrate it with

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
statistical physics or vice versa i

136
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
think we heard some of the seeds of that

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
but it'd be good to clarify

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
yeah if you want yes okay so

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
i think

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
patricia and i started to chat about

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
this uh two or three years ago at a

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,199
conference uh problem uh so

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
my background in uh is in uh quantum

144
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
neuroscience and uh

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
philosophy

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,560
mainly so masters involved and during my

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,479
work at edinboro

148
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
as a phd student i was actually

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,680
co-supervised by a person

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
peggy serrier

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
who is an expert in

152
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,880
psychophysics

153
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
and then she moved slowly uh to apply

154
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
tools from

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
basian modeling and reinforcement

156
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
learning modeling to psychiatry and so

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
my and my other supervisor was

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,039
andy clark and so was a good

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,240
um

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
say uh

161
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,479
environment for me you know to

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
learn about active inference i think

163
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,479
those were the early days of this

164
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,600
approach

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
and started to are asking questions

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
basically about the approach in terms of

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
actual applications a very limited

168
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,639
experience

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,160
i suppose that

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,120
the only uh serious modeling experience

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
said was during my uh phd

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
where with another collaborator we

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
started to model

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,599
uh things in uh

175
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,160
abroad bayesian framework

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
um this paper came in to be i think

177
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,440
mainly because of my own interest in

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,759
bayesian modeling and patricia's own

179
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,880
interest

180
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
which she just mentioned in statistical

181
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
physics approaches

182
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
to economics and to other sciences and

183
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,520
so we started to ask hey

184
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
in terms of scientific representation

185
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
that's the focus of our paper focus is

186
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,919
not so much

187
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,280
as also in

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
written in the paper on the metaphysics

189
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
of you know active inference but more

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,680
about japanese language this formalism

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
the scientific representation and let's

192
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,880
ask what kinds of opportunities and

193
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,759
challenges that this formalism

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
presents when it comes to applying it

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
outside

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,599
its say

197
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
original field as in you know statistics

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
statistical physics

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
and so we started to chat and uh with a

200
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
back and forth

201
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
for a while and then we

202
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,240
um

203
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,199
say

204
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,759
started to put into focus

205
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
various opportunities and challenges in

206
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
applying

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,479
say

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
concepts from

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
thermodynamics and statistical physics

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,080
to make sense and understand

211
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
organisms and life science phenomena and

212
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
what

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
you know we found very interesting is

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
this kind of trade-off between the

215
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
generality of it that is it seems that

216
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,760
the machinery of the free energy

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
principle or active inference uh you

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
know we might have a discussion about

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,000
the difference if any between the two

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
how this machinery allows allows you to

221
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,600
cover at least a model

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
many types of systems at least allegedly

223
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
but with a sacrifice in a plausibility

224
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,279
uh what we call a realism in the paper

225
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
and again by itself is trade-off we

226
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
don't think there is anything wrong with

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
uh you know

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
going for maximal generality in an

229
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
approach that might cover you know or at

230
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
least allegedly from cells

231
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,320
up to you know cultural phenomena

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
um and that's our paper in a nutshell

233
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
that is how these trade-offs might

234
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
depend on a choice of

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
language or formalism to make sense of

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
allegedly any

237
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,440
thing and again the thing good

238
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
is one of the key terms i think

239
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,080
that the maxwell and you know before him

240
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,800
carfreestone uh put on the map here and

241
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
i think it's a helpful way also to look

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
at our contribution again

243
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
in a nutshell i think the

244
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
framework of thinggood

245
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
uh might miss out

246
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
the most interesting properties of the

247
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
kind of thing

248
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
if there are things um say organisms

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
happen to be

250
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,880
thanks for that patricia anything to add

251
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
i'll suggest just um to to repeat what

252
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,959
what matteo said so my interest in the

253
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,560
free energy principle came from my

254
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
interest in the application of

255
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
statistical mechanics to all the

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
disciplines so that's why we started

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,959
discussing this and that's why i got so

258
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,680
excited about this about this research

259
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
and i agree with the summary of the

260
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
paper that mateo just just did

261
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
this thread of grounding in fundamental

262
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,680
physics ideas and then trade-offs or

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
opportunities and challenges really

264
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,399
became clear so

265
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,600
maybe one

266
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
general opening question

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,279
what does it mean for a non-statistical

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,839
physics idea to be grounded in

269
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,600
statistical physics like we're

270
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
intrinsically talking about some

271
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary

272
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
or applied scenario so we're leaving

273
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
that thing that field of statistical

274
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
physics

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
what baggage good and bad do we take

276
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
with us and then is it an advantage is

277
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
it a weakness what does it actually mean

278
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
for a non-physics area to be grounded in

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
physics

280
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
yeah thank you for the questions that's

281
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
one of the questions i have motivated my

282
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
research in the last years

283
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
uh i don't think there is a unique

284
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
answer to that so the more i do research

285
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
on the applications of statistical

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
mechanics to other discipline the more i

287
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
understand that it varies so it depends

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
on how it is used how how statistical

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
mechanics is used

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
and it depends also on the case studies

291
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
and disciplines and the specific models

292
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
so i think that's why it's worth to look

293
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
at specific case studies to specific

294
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
applications of free of

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,000
statistical mechanics to the disciplines

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in order to answer that question like on

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
a case by case basis

298
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
i think in some cases the application of

299
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
statistical mechanics is well justified

300
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,959
especially when the idealizations are

301
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,320
well justified in some other cases as i

302
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
would say tend to think that it's the

303
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
case of the free energy principle the

304
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
application of statistical mechanistic

305
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,920
lack justification so

306
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
we are not saying or we are not

307
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
concluding in the you know paper that

308
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
that cannot be i know that it doesn't

309
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
make sense to

310
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
propose a principle that is based on

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
statistical mechanics but we just think

312
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
that there is much more work to be done

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
in the justification of especially of

314
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
the idealizations that are involved when

315
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
we use statistical mechanics to

316
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
formulate a principle like the free

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
energy principle

318
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
classic philosophy where do we air or

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
miss when we idealize make ideas of or

320
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,399
generalize

321
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
specific

322
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
systems

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,040
or things

324
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,079
um

325
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,880
and what is the thing concept or the

326
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
system concept

327
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,760
in either patricia or mateo in either of

328
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
your areas like if you mentioned a thing

329
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
or a system what would that mean in

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
to the the disciplines that you're

331
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
working with and then how is it being

332
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,040
used differently

333
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,519
in fep and active and then i see steve

334
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,079
my dad you want to answer this

335
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,880
sure um

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
i mean in a sense your question is about

337
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
metaphysics uh and the question is

338
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,880
what's the thing and what

339
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
uh in what way we can make sense of a

340
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
thing good uh with you know a formalism

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
like the formalism

342
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
markov blankets for instance or the

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
formalism of uh

344
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,959
statistical

345
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,320
mechanics

346
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,519
um

347
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,760
just to turn the point slightly in a

348
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
different direction if you may

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
um

350
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,480
i suppose the uh question about thing

351
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
good and the role of idolizations on

352
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
which you know patricia just

353
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
commented on

354
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,440
is not just boiling down to the to the

355
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
you know conclusion that ah that's

356
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
difficult let's move on uh to to apply

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
these tools um

358
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,199
to a certain system

359
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,680
uh the challenge we put on the table

360
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,120
here is

361
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,639
concerning the generality of it

362
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,279
uh the generality of the act inference

363
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,480
approach

364
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
uh you know there is a excellent work uh

365
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,760
by uh philipp schwantenberg and others

366
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
using act inference models

367
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,920
uh in uh market decision processes with

368
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,120
humans you know fitting decisions in

369
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
reinforcement learning or decision tasks

370
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,279
with active inference models and again

371
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
this is just one example of a productive

372
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,800
use of the active inference

373
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,720
approach which you know resonates with

374
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
regular approaches like bayesian

375
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,839
modeling or reinforcement learning

376
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,040
modeling

377
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
what

378
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,800
uh we're taking issue with is

379
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
look you're making claims

380
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,920
about a maximum scope

381
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
okay maximum scope kind of application

382
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,880
of this approach

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,680
and to sensibly apply

384
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,839
you know models

385
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,519
at any scale you know any scale even

386
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
outside the life sciences you know

387
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,920
having to do with economies

388
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
or thing good certain assumptions must

389
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
be in place and these assumptions you

390
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,839
know we provide a number of

391
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,759
examples which all involve the

392
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
availability of

393
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,959
large data sets okay that can constrain

394
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
uh say the application of the model and

395
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
also background knowledge about

396
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
the target this is the target system and

397
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
the thing you want to understand

398
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
and especially you know bridges

399
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
conceptual bridges between parameters

400
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
within your model

401
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,160
and features of the actual systems you

402
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,279
want to

403
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
represent so these are the three i think

404
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,959
challenges that

405
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,759
we put on the map for again the

406
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,800
large

407
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,639
scope or very general scope

408
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,680
some understanding of active inference

409
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
or the free energy principle so this is

410
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
a bit of topic so i didn't really answer

411
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
your question about thing but at least

412
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,560
these are

413
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
motivations we had

414
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,199
to write this paper as in

415
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
making claims about maximal scope come

416
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,519
with

417
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
commitments and these commitments at

418
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
least in the case of

419
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
many or most biological systems do not

420
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,279
look uh satisfied or plausible

421
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,399
thank you

422
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
in a way it does

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
oh wait maybe a little bit mateo

424
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
but um in a way it does

425
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
address this question about our models

426
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
as things and their relationship to

427
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
other things perhaps the target of

428
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
modeling so patricia if you want to add

429
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,679
anything

430
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,199
otherwise we can go to stephen

431
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,359
just to stress some of the things that

432
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,079
matteo said because i hear the session

433
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,199
offline i hear the session of last week

434
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,640
and i i i saw that um

435
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,199
maxwell was

436
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,880
concerned or pointing out that we

437
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
didn't take the cases that the

438
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
applications of the free energy

439
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
principle to some systems in biology

440
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,799
seriously

441
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,240
and but the thing is that our claim we

442
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
did take them seriously and we mentioned

443
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
them in the paper

444
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
but that doesn't contradict uh our

445
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
claim because our claim wasn't that

446
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,559
the

447
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
statistical mechanics cannot or the

448
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
language of dynamical systems cannot be

449
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
used to model biological systems our

450
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
claim was about the generality of this

451
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
of this principle so basically we were

452
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
concerned or where we

453
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
were casting doubt on the possibility of

454
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
formulating a general principle like the

455
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
free energy principle that presupposes

456
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,760
that all

457
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
relevant biological systems can be

458
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
modeled as random dynamical systems so

459
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,760
just to emphasize that our claim was our

460
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
concerns with the free energy principle

461
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
had to do with generality of this

462
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
principle and not with the possibility

463
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
of modeling uh

464
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
some biological systems in that way

465
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
using the language of random dynamical

466
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,640
system

467
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
thank you so stephen and then anyone in

468
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,120
the live chat or anyone with a raised

469
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
hand here

470
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
yeah thanks this is very interesting

471
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
hopefully you can hear me okay um

472
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,799
i'm curious um i know that in the the

473
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
the reference you make to the paper that

474
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
is um

475
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
life as we know it so

476
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
there there's that question about um

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,520
suggesting that life or biological

478
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,720
self-organization is an inevitable and

479
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
emerging property of any ergodic random

480
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
dynamical system that possesses a markov

481
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
blanket

482
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
and i know that

483
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
in some ways i i i sense that what

484
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
they've done to try and

485
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,440
deflate that claim from 2013 is maybe to

486
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
go down the mathematical route

487
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,799
i s i sense that you're saying they

488
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,799
need to maybe also go down the physics

489
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
route would that

490
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
would that be something

491
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,400
that you would say like in terms of how

492
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
that um

493
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
that statement

494
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
which has to some extent been couched

495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,679
over the last few years

496
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,480
um are you saying that these you know

497
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
the the physics aspects

498
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,440
um haven't been addressed as much as the

499
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,039
statistical aspects

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
i can say a couple of things and then i

501
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
leave it to you patricia yes very very

502
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
quickly um

503
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
so um

504
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
one

505
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
uh line

506
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
uh of criticism about our paper is that

507
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,110
you know

508
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,679
[Music]

509
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,320
the active inference approach has been

510
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,559
evolving over time and so we're making

511
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,559
claims about ergodicity and

512
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,840
which are just obsolete now because

513
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
uh you know from the coast hostile

514
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,760
paper uh that assumption seems to be

515
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
dropped

516
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
uh and replaced with uh the the

517
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
assumption of stationarity

518
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
but then the question actually two

519
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
questions one question is

520
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
why should we believe that any uh

521
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,360
life science phenomenon any organism is

522
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,159
stationary this what is it what is the

523
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,640
justification for that assumption

524
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
and the second uh

525
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,840
observation

526
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,000
before i leave it to patricia is that

527
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
even within the paper you know that the

528
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
constitutional paper which is you know

529
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
um

530
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,360
theoretically uh very rich

531
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,240
they

532
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
frame the contribution to biology in

533
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,880
terms of a metaphor

534
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
explicitly early on they're saying look

535
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,360
what we're seeing here is just a

536
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,200
metaphorical uh representation

537
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
and so in a sense that's what we're

538
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,039
being arguing for that is sure you can

539
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,080
gain this maximal generality but at the

540
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,760
cost of uh making assumptions either

541
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
ergodicity or structurality now which

542
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
might might not apply to biological

543
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
systems

544
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,200
thank you patricia

545
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
yeah so

546
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,880
to to answer stephen's concern i would

547
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
say yes so one of the things that we

548
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,640
wanted to point out is that

549
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
we need to focus on the on the physical

550
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
foundations of the free energy principle

551
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
a little bit more than only the

552
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,320
statistical foundations of the free

553
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,559
energy principle so we believe we don't

554
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,120
claim to be the only ones that focus on

555
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
on that but we believe that there's lack

556
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
of literature in that sense and we

557
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,799
wanted to contribute to uh to to that to

558
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,600
fill that gap what we call feel that god

559
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,360
uh so that's

560
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,679
that's the short answer and then um

561
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,760
about again the discussion that you had

562
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
last last week

563
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,480
uh you saw maxwell i think as well was

564
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,039
complaining that we focus too much on

565
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
the older formulations of the free

566
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
energy principle instead of the

567
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,720
enumerations and he basically said that

568
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,559
ergodicity doesn't play any role it's

569
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,240
not even mentioned in the new

570
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
formulations of the free energy

571
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
principle

572
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
i don't have a biological background or

573
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
background in neuroscience and i haven't

574
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,559
worked for a long time in the free

575
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,760
energy principle but i do have a

576
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
background in physics

577
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
and i am a little bit puzzled with the

578
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
idea that ecbodicity doesn't play any

579
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
role in the new formulations of the free

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
energy principle especially because they

581
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
explicitly allude to

582
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
the existence of weakly mixing random

583
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,520
dynamical systems and to my knowledge

584
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,000
mixing systems require erodicity so

585
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
implied erodicity so i'm really not sure

586
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
and i haven't seen

587
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,080
explicitly how can you drop the

588
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
assumption of eliciting the free energy

589
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
principle so

590
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
i think that if they if some authors

591
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
working on the free energy principle

592
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
could clarify to what extent or why you

593
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
don't need their basicity anymore i

594
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,799
think that would be helpful so we would

595
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
be grateful for that we wouldn't

596
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
consider that as a failure in our

597
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
project so we would consider it as a

598
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
success so if our paper leads to more

599
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,640
clarity in the free energy literature

600
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
that would be a successful paper for us

601
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,440
and and i think the fact that bill edal

602
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,679
also some paper that was quoted in this

603
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,840
discussion last week also

604
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
allude to the older formulations of the

605
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
free energy principle just shows

606
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,440
maybe a confusion in the literature

607
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
between older formulations and new

608
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,679
formulations so i think again it would

609
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,840
be very helpful for people interested in

610
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
this at least to to have more clarity

611
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
about what has changed in this new

612
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
framework in these new formulations of

613
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
the free energy principle

614
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,880
and to have a more consistent framework

615
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
that one can work with because we were

616
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,760
interested in working with the

617
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
legitimate framework we weren't against

618
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
the free energy principle and then tried

619
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
to look for the weak for the weakest

620
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
argument to attack them so that was

621
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
never our strategy i don't have anything

622
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
but i am not married against

623
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,960
the free energy principle i don't have

624
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
anything a priori against crystal

625
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
so the same with matteo so we are just

626
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,679
generally interested in in this

627
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,279
application because it can be actually

628
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,000
potentially useful or because it has

629
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
been so

630
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,039
uh it has caught so much attention in

631
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
the in biology so that's why we are

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
interested in this in the first place

633
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
not with the idea of attacking the free

634
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
energy principle so again

635
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,080
if we could have better understanding of

636
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
of why

637
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,440
the new formulations don't require

638
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
ludicity or about what are the key

639
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,520
assumptions in the new formulations of

640
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
the free energy principle i think that

641
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,279
would save us time and

642
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
we would be happy to to look at that so

643
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,799
i i think again

644
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,200
i i agree that we focus mostly on the

645
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,640
older versions of the free energy

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
principle but i think it was

647
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,720
partially because the papers were clear

648
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,480
and not because we wanted to attack the

649
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
weaker

650
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
papers in the same like the fact that

651
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
they appeal again to the existence of

652
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,559
weakly mixing random dynamical systems

653
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,320
suggested for me that they still are

654
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
using ergodicity

655
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
and apart from that ergodicity was not

656
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,440
the only argument that we were

657
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
presenting in the paper so we also

658
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,000
mentioned phase spaces and attractors

659
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
and the new formulations still require

660
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,679
phase spaces because they need some

661
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,720
probability and they uh they also

662
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,440
consider or model homo aesthetics or

663
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
non-equilibrium steady states as uh in

664
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,360
terms of attractors

665
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,200
and that again falls into our criticism

666
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,559
because we were pointing out

667
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,159
independently of the ergodicity

668
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
assumption we were pointing out that

669
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,960
it's very hard to model in most systems

670
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,039
biological system even physical system

671
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,720
perhaps um

672
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
stationary non-equilibrium stationary

673
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
states in terms of attractors because

674
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,279
attractors implies some asymptotic

675
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,600
results and it's not easy to get these

676
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
asymptotic results

677
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
and so basically that was our criticism

678
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,640
so we were by no means only focusing on

679
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
eroticity even if ebodicity doesn't play

680
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,279
any role in nervous formulations in in

681
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
new formulations which is not clear to

682
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,640
me

683
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
but even so i would say the other points

684
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
still remain and we would like to to

685
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
have a clear answer to that even even if

686
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
that means that we have to i don't know

687
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,159
say that we were wrong in the end but um

688
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,400
i insist so if our paper leads to more

689
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
clarity in the literature that we will

690
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
be fine we will consider it as success

691
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,159
thanks for that and welcome blue so i'll

692
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,720
just give one comment and then stephen

693
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,440
so

694
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,240
absolutely about the evolution and

695
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
changes it's a non-stationary or maybe

696
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
there's a higher level of a stationarity

697
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
to the literature but it's one reason

698
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
why blue and i and maybe you if anyone

699
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,679
listening wants to contribute seriously

700
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,120
to this are very interested in tracking

701
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,320
the

702
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
nomenclature and which letters are used

703
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
to refer to internal and external states

704
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
and which assumptions are implicit or

705
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,679
explicit how does that play out with the

706
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,480
evolution of literature in this area so

707
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,399
that's like something that we'll

708
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,880
hopefully will be able to point to

709
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,600
maybe it's going to be version 1.4 in

710
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,559
this paper or you know version 1.4 the

711
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,880
the english gambit we can name them like

712
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,159
chess openings

713
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,399
okay stephen

714
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,919
yeah i think you make a good point i

715
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,480
mean i think also i i do agree in the de

716
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,039
costa paper stationarity has really

717
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,880
given us another way in to some sort of

718
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
state that gets revisited it doesn't

719
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
necessarily

720
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
take out a good city maybe adds another

721
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
potential so

722
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,360
there's this this question

723
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,200
doesn't it can't just be answered from a

724
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
math perspective like i think it's

725
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
there's this physics

726
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,000
um reality and maybe this is where

727
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,080
non-equilibrium chemistry starts to come

728
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,799
in or that's a new field um

729
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,919
and i i think that your your points are

730
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
are useful in clarifying

731
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
some of those questions i suppose the

732
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
question that also comes up which is

733
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,039
maybe less common in physics

734
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,919
is

735
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,840
how much can

736
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
science how much can

737
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,240
um a kind of noisy

738
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
version of ergodicity

739
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,399
be enough

740
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
and at what point you know how many

741
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,919
beers is it before i fall over you know

742
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,159
at what point does um

743
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,840
does the active influences process come

744
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
down and i i don't actually think that's

745
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,640
necessarily been

746
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
brought in but i don't know if physics

747
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
knows quite how to handle that question

748
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,480
yes how stringently do specific

749
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,120
realizations or models especially if

750
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,520
they're being evaluated on utility

751
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,320
how stringently must they fulfill

752
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
some of the underlying frameworks like

753
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,559
we talked about how the t-test is built

754
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
around equal variances unless you're

755
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,200
using an inequal variance version

756
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
and of course those will never be

757
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,080
precisely realized but then

758
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,200
how close to being precisely realized

759
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
must or should things be

760
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,240
um matteo or patricia any thoughts

761
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,360
oh otherwise the the comment that came

762
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,679
to mind was patricia you mentioned um

763
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,960
and it was in your 2018 paper i think

764
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,919
that we looked at in the dot zero

765
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,559
about how there's the asymptotic

766
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,840
characteristics and the convergence time

767
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,000
so that was very interesting um just

768
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
that there was a there was it's sort of

769
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,880
this

770
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,799
attractor but there was more to the

771
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,159
attractor than just where it was

772
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
so maybe

773
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,559
unpack that and then how did you see

774
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,919
that grafting into or relating to the

775
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
um comments on fvp and active

776
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,080
yeah exactly

777
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,840
sorry i have to leave now thank

778
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,200
you you know

779
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
it's been fun uh

780
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,080
i'm very sorry you know it lasted only

781
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
30 minutes because

782
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,480
i saw so blue joined and i had answers

783
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,799
to a couple of their questions in my

784
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
previous sessions about dynamic

785
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,320
equilibrium and

786
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,240
why we use internal

787
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
uh states uh as active states

788
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,039
well we can do 31.3

789
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,600
literally anytime we can do it in a year

790
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,080
so that's why we do decimal notation any

791
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
time it's right just let us know and

792
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
you're always welcome back for a guest

793
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,000
stream presenting on current work so

794
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,960
good luck with your teaching

795
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,360
responsibilities and see you soon

796
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,519
too generously church hello everybody

797
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
and thanks for paying attention

798
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,279
cheers to patricia

799
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,399
okay

800
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,159
yeah so

801
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,960
yeah you were mentioning my 2018 paper

802
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
thank you er yeah so that

803
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,919
i think the the question of asymptotics

804
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,120
is related to the question of

805
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,039
approximation science and i am

806
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,760
interested in both questions

807
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,320
and this is basically what i have done

808
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,080
independently of the free energy

809
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,840
principle in the in my research in the

810
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
last in the last year so basically what

811
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
i what i pointed out about asymptotics

812
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
in the paper that you were mentioning

813
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,679
is that um

814
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,039
in order to make a model realistic a

815
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,080
model that takes a synthetic

816
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,000
into account in order to make that model

817
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,279
realistic

818
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,080
we not only have to pay attention to the

819
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,320
solutions that you get in the limit when

820
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
you take a limit you also have to pay

821
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
attention to how fast that limit

822
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,760
converges

823
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,240
in that time that can be considered

824
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,559
relaxation time or that

825
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,880
time that it takes that that the limits

826
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,919
needs

827
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,679
in order to to

828
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,440
or that we need in order to achieve that

829
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
limit um

830
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,840
needs to be realistic too

831
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,360
so you don't only you

832
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,279
you don't only have to pay attention to

833
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
the values that you take that you that

834
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,880
you obtain when you take a limit you

835
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
also have to

836
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
to pay attention to the

837
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,559
to

838
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,600
um

839
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,080
the rate in which you approach that

840
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
limit

841
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,080
so that will also help you to understand

842
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
how realistic is the model that you are

843
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
that you are using

844
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,559
how would that tie to approximation

845
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,960
science

846
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,519
uh it depends again

847
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,240
some some models like on the models that

848
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
you're analyzing in the science that you

849
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,039
are looking at

850
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,679
so if you are

851
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
investigating models that use limits

852
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
then there is a very clear understanding

853
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,000
of approximation because uh limits give

854
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,720
you sort of a neat

855
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
understanding of the approximations that

856
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,559
you are using

857
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
but approximations are not always uh in

858
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,039
the form of limits sometimes

859
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,720
approximations can be in the form of

860
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
similarity and then

861
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,000
saying to what extent that model is

862
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
realistic it can be a little bit more

863
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,039
obscure

864
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
so when your model implies limit then

865
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,880
you might have a clear way of

866
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
understanding to what extent your model

867
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,519
is close to to the to the target that

868
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,159
you are trying to mode

869
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,120
very

870
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
interesting so

871
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,159
one

872
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,399
thought that's um come up

873
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,880
in a few different contexts is um it's

874
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,120
almost like a vitalism 1.0 and a

875
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,200
vitalism 2.0

876
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
and the 1.0 was like you know is there

877
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,119
the elan vital is there something more

878
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,639
to it than

879
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,079
chemistry in biology and you know the

880
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,599
synthesis

881
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,399
ex vitro or x vivo should i say of

882
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,079
vitamin c for some reason it's pointed

883
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,760
to as an example of like demonstrating

884
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,839
that biological molecules could arise

885
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,679
through chemical synthesis

886
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,839
and therefore maybe more than just

887
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,679
vitamin c but maybe dna could also be

888
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,918
made in the test tube

889
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,800
and now we're in a area where we're

890
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
asking okay

891
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,159
given that grounding of biology in

892
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,359
physics and chemistry 1.0 how do we go

893
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,440
from that sort of

894
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
equilibrium

895
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,719
into homeostasis and allostasis and more

896
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,560
advanced forms of

897
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,079
predictive

898
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,280
higher level

899
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
behavior

900
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
from systems that are also

901
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,400
composed of less strategic components

902
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
so

903
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,400
um

904
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,079
there's going to be just like there were

905
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
challenges going from the

906
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,240
physics of a membrane into understanding

907
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,599
how biological systems deploy membranes

908
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,400
now we're moving up a level into the

909
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
cybernetic or into the anticipatory

910
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,720
space and asking how those very same

911
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,960
biological systems which we've deflated

912
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
away to be chemical and physical

913
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,240
now will there be another level of

914
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
deflation or is this a bubble that's a

915
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
little harder to pop

916
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,119
so

917
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,800
steven and then patricia or anyone else

918
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,960
with thoughts

919
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
yeah this is a good point about

920
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
it being a bit harder to pop

921
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,200
um because there's a lot of uh once you

922
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
get into the chemistry there's a lot of

923
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
um

924
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,560
there's a lot of hidden states let's put

925
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,640
it like that so there's that assumption

926
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
that you pass through often maybe a

927
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
transition state when you go from

928
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
reactants to products but it's going

929
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,680
from equilibrium to equilibrium even the

930
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,839
transition state is looked at

931
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,680
in terms of its energy

932
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
accessibility

933
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,079
but

934
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,400
that's again a kind of a stable state so

935
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
this question about something

936
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,000
circling around non-equilibrium

937
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,560
or far from equilibrium

938
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,440
um mixing states which is why i think

939
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,680
you can't i think they say ergodicity

940
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
can't be or something along those lines

941
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
can't be ignored

942
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,280
uh certainly once you get into anything

943
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,920
which is more in the

944
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
liquid

945
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,240
uh

946
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,760
contexts

947
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
um so the question comes up then is when

948
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
you've got these

949
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,520
attractors or these far from equilibrium

950
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,720
states which are not necessarily

951
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,040
energetically favored

952
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,160
alone they may be somehow entropically

953
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,119
favored or somehow complexity favored

954
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,000
through

955
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,079
these attractors you know is that

956
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
something around how catalysts are

957
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,440
working

958
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,000
um in the more sort of if you were to go

959
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,040
in at a more detailed level of modelling

960
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,080
um so i wonder how

961
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,640
[Music]

962
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,320
your thoughts are around the sort of

963
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,160
catalysis processes that might be

964
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,520
happening in biological systems and

965
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,800
how

966
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
you know how do these far from

967
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,119
equilibrium states

968
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
facilitate

969
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
these

970
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,560
these abilities to

971
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,200
minimize free

972
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,440
energy if you have any thoughts not

973
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
patricia otherwise blue

974
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,400
do you wanna

975
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,640
i would leave that to blue we have to

976
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,160
work more on the free energy principle

977
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,800
i don't know i i think uh the assumption

978
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
that i've worked more on the free energy

979
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,640
principle is maybe kind of

980
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
i don't know

981
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,800
not

982
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
not right i don't really have an answer

983
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,130
don't let the cat ears deceive you

984
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,760
[Laughter]

985
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
but

986
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,599
cool questions um

987
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,560
there's many other avenues we can go but

988
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,200
patricia what is your current

989
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,240
research

990
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,520
or what do you see following your work

991
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,800
now that it

992
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,560
came out like what where do you go from

993
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
that state update

994
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,720
to your next questions if they're

995
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,079
related or not it's all good

996
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,520
yeah actually i'm thinking about

997
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
applying for a project

998
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,839
uh which it doesn't have to do with free

999
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,680
energy principle but it does have to do

1000
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,040
with applications of statistical

1001
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,200
mechanics to biology

1002
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,280
so i have been working for a few years i

1003
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
will probably i'm so i just um finish a

1004
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,520
book on emergency reduction in physics

1005
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,839
so i have been working on a concept of

1006
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,839
emergency reduction for physical systems

1007
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,280
especially thinking about critical

1008
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
phenomena

1009
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,119
and what i want to do now is to see

1010
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,440
whether that notion of emergence and

1011
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
reduction that i suggest also works for

1012
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,160
biological systems but i will focus on

1013
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
biological systems that can be modeled

1014
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,560
as critical phenomena which means can be

1015
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,079
model using the physics of phase

1016
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,680
transitions

1017
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,440
so this is what i what i have in mind

1018
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,720
now and i i i intuitively think so my

1019
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,760
binary uh hypothesis is that

1020
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
the same concept doesn't work for

1021
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,520
biological systems and well that one

1022
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,920
needs to distinguish between them but i

1023
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
think it would be useful to look at

1024
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
specifically at systems that can be

1025
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,040
modeled

1026
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
as

1027
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,880
critical phenomena

1028
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
to see this analogy maybe between

1029
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
biological systems and physical systems

1030
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,240
so that's maybe the reason why i will

1031
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,160
focus especially on those systems that

1032
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,920
can be according to

1033
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,240
to to many physicists b model and

1034
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,160
biologists be modeled as a critical

1035
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,760
phenomenon

1036
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,280
interesting in fact criticality

1037
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
is uh perhaps again the language

1038
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,880
analysis will reveal in the future but

1039
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,200
it's not a term that gets brought up

1040
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,119
in the active and fep area that much

1041
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,359
it's more apt to describe assist

1042
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,119
although in

1043
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
fristen's work on neural systems there

1044
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,880
actually is a lot of it and so there's

1045
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,920
actually so much in the spm and

1046
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
dynamical modeling literature that has

1047
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,640
um

1048
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
not made it quite over the hill

1049
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
but i think that there's

1050
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
more to be said we'll look forward to

1051
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
that book stephen

1052
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah just that's an interesting point

1053
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
and they're making um can i just ask so

1054
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,880
is it almost like

1055
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
you think there's a lot of

1056
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
um

1057
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,319
a lot of computational processes that

1058
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,400
can happen purely through phase

1059
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,599
transitions and statistical processes

1060
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,280
which

1061
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,960
is not quite the same as an inference

1062
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,119
process but it is it may be more like

1063
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,880
the sort of thing you see when

1064
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
molds um

1065
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,680
find their way to food and things like

1066
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,119
that so you sort of saying there's a

1067
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,839
kind of a physics

1068
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,000
explanation for some things which

1069
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
doesn't require

1070
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,040
an influence process

1071
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,400
and that could do a lot of the heavy

1072
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,880
lifting

1073
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,480
yeah so i'm i will focus on on on models

1074
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,240
that use the mathematics of phase

1075
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,480
transitions with variations so you never

1076
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,160
use exactly the same mathematics you

1077
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,079
have to you have to make change

1078
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,520
depending on the case study that you're

1079
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
investigating

1080
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,520
but i will i will focus on on models

1081
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,160
that um that use the mathematics of

1082
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
phase transitions to understand

1083
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,240
biological phenomena

1084
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
uh

1085
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,480
an example would be [ __ ] behavior for

1086
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,240
example so there are plenty of models

1087
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,319
that use the icing model or something

1088
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,119
like the icing model uh to understand

1089
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,040
falcon behavior which is that behavior

1090
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,359
of birds that seem to be emerging with

1091
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,960
respect to the behavior of individual

1092
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
birds

1093
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,040
and in other case studies like melding

1094
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
protein melding that can be modeled as a

1095
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,920
phase transition

1096
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,680
so i'm going to i'm going to analyze

1097
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
plenty of case studies of research that

1098
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
have been done already in physics or in

1099
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
biology

1100
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
and the idea would be to understand what

1101
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
kind of

1102
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
notion of emergence do you find in

1103
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,560
biological systems and the question is

1104
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,400
whether that is similar to the notion of

1105
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,119
emergence that appears in

1106
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,520
in physical systems

1107
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,760
and as i said i intuitively think that

1108
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
it's not the same but since i will look

1109
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,680
at similar case studies i think that can

1110
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,440
show the difference between biological

1111
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,839
systems and physical systems quite quite

1112
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,319
clearly

1113
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,400
[Music]

1114
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,319
there's one thing i was curious then is

1115
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,760
it like because

1116
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
this is interesting when i'm talking to

1117
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,200
people who've got maybe more of a

1118
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,079
chemistry background emergence is more

1119
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,280
the emergence of interactions between

1120
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,760
things right molecules and stuff and

1121
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,119
then you get these kind of and then

1122
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,680
you've got this more process based

1123
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,240
kind of inference dynamical

1124
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,119
one so are you you sort of seen the way

1125
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,599
of emergence being able to do quite a

1126
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,720
lot from the kind of perspective of

1127
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,520
things interacting with each other based

1128
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
on rules

1129
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,240
rather than non-linear dynamical

1130
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,480
approach

1131
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,599
both

1132
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,839
actually so you find both in phase

1133
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,760
transitions that way that's why phase

1134
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,359
transitions in physics have been

1135
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,680
considered as the prototype example of

1136
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,839
emergent

1137
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,760
behavior because you find

1138
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,160
non-linearity you find um

1139
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,680
long range correlations

1140
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,440
and well the interactions in most

1141
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,520
systems are local but you still have

1142
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,400
these long-range correlations

1143
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,800
that require using some fun segments

1144
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,119
like the randomization group methods for

1145
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,319
example

1146
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,480
so you have some notion of collectivity

1147
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,040
there in in phase transitions in physics

1148
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,800
not because of long-range interactions

1149
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,640
but because of long-range correlations

1150
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,880
so it appears as if the

1151
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,680
interaction between between uh distant

1152
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,599
particles would be would be long-range

1153
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,359
it is not but it appears like that

1154
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,680
because you have long-range correlations

1155
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,000
so i will look at similar cases in

1156
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,160
biology that have been modeled already

1157
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,599
using physics

1158
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,520
and then i will try to answer whether

1159
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,760
that notion of emergence in terms of

1160
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,079
non-linearity and so on

1161
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,560
what i suggest it's emergence emergent

1162
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
behavior in physics can also be applied

1163
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,920
to biology

1164
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,599
and i think well but this is this is

1165
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,520
preliminary so this is not these are not

1166
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,680
the results of my research because i

1167
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,000
will be doing that for the next years

1168
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,480
but a preliminary thought

1169
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,880
is um

1170
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,240
you will see a difference especially

1171
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,079
with top-down causation that might

1172
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,079
happen in biology that doesn't happen in

1173
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,319
physics but this is just preliminary so

1174
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,800
again we try not to say too much about

1175
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,280
this because i haven't done the pro i

1176
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
just have done the research for the

1177
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
project but i haven't done the project

1178
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,680
so

1179
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,640
you can you can wait for this result

1180
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,599
thank you

1181
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,839
blue

1182
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,160
so that's super interesting um

1183
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,560
and again something that like i'm very

1184
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,359
interested in is this um idea of

1185
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,440
emergence and when you're you're

1186
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
studying phase transitions or

1187
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,560
criticality in physics like for example

1188
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,520
just to from a liquid to a gas you know

1189
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,079
it's easy to see on a graph this kind of

1190
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,640
inflection point of temperature where

1191
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,480
the phase transition occurs

1192
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,359
um

1193
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,520
and i just am wondering what kind of

1194
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,680
metrics you're using to quantify

1195
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,880
emergence um in your future research in

1196
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,839
biological systems

1197
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,960
uh that depends again

1198
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,839
sorry that many many times my is the

1199
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,920
same but that depends on the i'm not

1200
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,400
using a specific metric because i'm not

1201
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,960
proposing as a general framework

1202
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,280
i'm just studying like different case

1203
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
studies and depending on the case study

1204
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,800
on the kind of phase transition that i'm

1205
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
studying is the the metric that is

1206
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
attached to it

1207
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,359
but i'm not i'm not suggesting a general

1208
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,000
formal framework that has a metric in

1209
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,319
itself so i'm i'm studying like case by

1210
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,440
case

1211
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,079
so can you maybe provide some examples

1212
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
or you don't want to say yet too much

1213
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,520
in biology

1214
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,440
yeah the [ __ ] behavior so there are

1215
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,520
different different models there i can

1216
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,119
you can you can send me an email if you

1217
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,440
want and i can address you to some this

1218
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,640
literature but there are plenty of

1219
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,880
models of funking behavior

1220
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,359
right that use that use models that are

1221
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,079
already so that sort of migrate models

1222
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,920
from physics so there's some of them use

1223
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,160
a slightly revised version of the of the

1224
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,040
icing model

1225
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,319
it makes me think about how uh the sort

1226
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,119
of

1227
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
initial target system

1228
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
let's just say a solid to a liquid phase

1229
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,720
transition

1230
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
and then there also

1231
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,599
are

1232
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,640
potentially critical dynamics related to

1233
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,160
information

1234
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,560
and decision making which comes into

1235
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,440
play in active inference where you could

1236
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,119
have uh

1237
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,520
a uh non-linear

1238
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
relationship between information coming

1239
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,599
in and then it's in policy mode a and

1240
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,079
then there's a phase transition to

1241
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,359
policy b

1242
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,760
and so um it's kind of like again that

1243
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,559
vitalism 1.0 2.0 there's going to be a

1244
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,480
lower bar a phase transition to talk

1245
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
about well the protein folding

1246
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,119
in the cell is going to be a special

1247
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,040
surrounding that facilitates it to do

1248
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
special kind of

1249
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,559
transitions physically

1250
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,880
but then how do we think about

1251
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,839
higher order behavioral properties

1252
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,319
especially when they exhibit

1253
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,200
some

1254
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,160
tantalizing similarity or analogy or

1255
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,319
metaphor like

1256
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,280
we've been discussing but can we just

1257
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,680
take those same models and think that

1258
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,760
it's going to be as clean all the way up

1259
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,520
um blue and then stephen

1260
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,880
so in the flocking model

1261
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,200
um for example like and you're talking

1262
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
about downward causation uh

1263
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and something as something that you wish

1264
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,680
to study and so i'm sure that you've

1265
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
maybe read um the information theory of

1266
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,079
individuality paper by um david pakkauer

1267
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,000
and that group at the santa fe institute

1268
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,760
so there's um

1269
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,440
a point in which

1270
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,119
you know this like group of birds that's

1271
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,200
like flying around you know kind of

1272
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,480
chaotically

1273
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,520
um assembles and forms like a flock and

1274
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,079
and um flies together in in like a kind

1275
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,040
of patterned way and so like i'm

1276
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,839
interested in in terms of criticality

1277
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,400
at what point is

1278
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
does downward causation occur right and

1279
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,960
and is that the point that then it stops

1280
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,440
being like the the ensemble becomes a

1281
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,760
group a unit that's functional like you

1282
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,200
know because there's it's like that's a

1283
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,400
good kind of way to look at um emergence

1284
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,119
but how do you find that point

1285
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,359
in in which there's the bi-directional

1286
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,040
information flow so this so that's

1287
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,880
that's maybe a better way to phrase my

1288
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,760
question

1289
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,319
yeah so i assign this great to discuss

1290
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,240
this with you but as i said i haven't

1291
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,559
done the whole research i am i'm happy

1292
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,680
to discuss my intuition here with with

1293
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,640
all of you

1294
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,078
but that's it yeah

1295
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,040
i so one of the hypotheses that i have

1296
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
is that you might find something like

1297
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,400
that welcome down

1298
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
downward conversation in biological

1299
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,240
systems i'm not sure of flocking

1300
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,559
behavior would be the place to find the

1301
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,240
workout session but

1302
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,079
i'm thinking about downward constant

1303
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,760
work station in terms of selection

1304
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,920
and it might be that you need some high

1305
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,839
order

1306
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,599
properties uh so that that sorry that

1307
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,160
high order properties explain some

1308
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,000
fitness

1309
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,880
and that in that way that calls somehow

1310
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,400
all the way down

1311
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,160
that um

1312
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,480
at the microscale at the micro level you

1313
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,880
observe some behavior as a result of the

1314
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,440
fitness that is uh sort of coarse grain

1315
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
or or or higher level

1316
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,920
so i'm thinking about that workout

1317
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,760
station in the in those

1318
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,040
terms

1319
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,119
but you might find other notions of

1320
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,960
downward causation there and i might

1321
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,960
found them in doing the research

1322
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,800
now in the flocking behavior i'm not

1323
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,920
sure but you might think that the

1324
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,880
the

1325
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,760
the ability of many of many birds to to

1326
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,319
go in a particular to to do a particular

1327
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,640
pattern has some some

1328
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,520
fitness associated to it and if so that

1329
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,599
fitness which is fitness

1330
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,920
of a group might explain the individual

1331
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,160
behavior so if that's correct then you

1332
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,440
might have a notion of downward

1333
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,280
consensus that you don't find

1334
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,400
necessarily in physics but uh this is

1335
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,920
just pretty these are preliminary

1336
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,079
intuitions

1337
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,800
thank you blue

1338
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,599
so like going towards like

1339
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,079
along those lines um and going back

1340
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,800
maybe to the attractor

1341
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,000
so so when there is like a the emergence

1342
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,040
of a group does does that like reign all

1343
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
of the individuals in the group

1344
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,040
like closer to a new attractor state or

1345
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,119
closer together like tighter like a

1346
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,720
tighter cluster around an attractive

1347
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
state or is it like the new attractor

1348
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,480
state is an emergent property of the

1349
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,880
group or or how do those two fit

1350
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,200
together like in terms of fitness

1351
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,680
um and you know in biological fitness

1352
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,040
you have to be able to maintain this

1353
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,280
kind of non-equilibrium steady state

1354
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,800
density

1355
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
so in terms of fitness of a group or

1356
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,119
cluster and biological systems

1357
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,240
is that

1358
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,280
like a new attractor or is there yeah or

1359
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,720
just what are your intuitions maybe

1360
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,319
about that

1361
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,480
yeah so i i wouldn't i wouldn't try to

1362
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,040
describe the notion of of emergence here

1363
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,440
in terms of attractors but it might be

1364
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,280
useful in the end

1365
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,880
but i would like to uh to

1366
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,119
have a notion of emergence that is that

1367
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,119
doesn't rely necessarily on attractions

1368
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,200
because i think that

1369
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,760
finding attractors is is a hard task in

1370
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,599
biology and some of these models don't

1371
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,520
work with attractors anyway so i don't i

1372
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,599
don't i don't think the notion of

1373
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
emergence needs to be associated

1374
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,480
necessarily to attract maybe in some

1375
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,640
cases it would be useful to understand

1376
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
emergency in that sense but i wouldn't

1377
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,400
think that it's necessary to understand

1378
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,319
emergency incentives for

1379
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,359
attracting

1380
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,520
and i agree with you but but um

1381
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
like the coupling of emergence maybe to

1382
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,200
fitness

1383
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,520
to me like i link fitness to an

1384
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,920
attractor and so it's it's hard for me

1385
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,800
to separate then if if

1386
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,359
fitness is linked to attractor but

1387
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,559
fitness is

1388
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,760
is not linked to um or is also linked to

1389
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,079
emergence then that that draws a line

1390
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,440
for me between

1391
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,280
emergence and detractor if that makes

1392
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,359
sense yes so that's why i will work with

1393
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,440
biologists on this project i'm not a

1394
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,400
biologist myself but i i i think that

1395
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,960
fitness can be defined also independent

1396
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,880
on the notion of attractors

1397
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,079
and i will try to take those notions

1398
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,920
cool we will try to adapt those

1399
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,280
definitions

1400
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,680
so dave just because you haven't asked a

1401
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,760
question yet then stephen

1402
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,079
yeah one of the reasons that uh looking

1403
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,079
for a track spending too much time

1404
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,480
looking for attractors associated with

1405
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,640
them with emergence is

1406
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,400
among the things that happens when you

1407
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
get emergent behavior is there's a more

1408
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
differentiated

1409
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,119
set of interfaces with the outer world

1410
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,119
and because of that there's less

1411
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,680
duplication and less

1412
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,119
resemblance among the

1413
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,160
subsystems already within

1414
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,279
the overall system

1415
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,400
cool thank you stephen

1416
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,680
yeah that's a good point around the

1417
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,839
challenge of identifying that attract

1418
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,720
especially if you've got this

1419
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,280
multi-scale nested i mean so you've got

1420
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,599
attractors that are only present for

1421
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,359
nanoseconds

1422
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,880
you know even if they're there and

1423
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,359
there's millions and billions of them

1424
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,960
you know you and then on top of that

1425
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,880
you've so i can imagine that it could be

1426
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,119
really useful and i i i'm curious um

1427
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,160
how

1428
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,760
you see that you know the freezing of

1429
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,880
ice

1430
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,720
um and the way that it you know water

1431
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,520
becomes more dense and actually

1432
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,280
about two degrees then starts to get

1433
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,559
less dense

1434
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,559
and as it approaches freezing and then

1435
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,760
you sort of hit this phase transition

1436
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
um and i think there's a real use in

1437
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,520
that also being learned about for active

1438
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,640
inference

1439
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,920
because although an active influence

1440
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,640
doesn't happen directly in the field of

1441
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,799
anything to do with entropy there's this

1442
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,760
common misconception of neg entropy as

1443
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,760
if you actually get a negative form of

1444
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,799
entropy

1445
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,720
which is kind of in the

1446
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,640
in the kind of common usage but there's

1447
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
no such thing directly as a neg entropy

1448
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,720
if there's a there's a negative there's

1449
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
a change in entropy

1450
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,319
you know there can be a variation in

1451
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,400
entropic but it's not

1452
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,559
a stable state in the same way that you

1453
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,880
get with energy but that that

1454
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,799
um i think that can be a misconception

1455
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,880
that um

1456
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,799
sort of creeps in quite a lot but i'd be

1457
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,160
curious if um i

1458
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,000
you know um

1459
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
effectively you know there's there's

1460
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,079
there's a value

1461
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,400
of entropy that goes down spooky value

1462
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,160
of entropy which no one quite knows

1463
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,920
what's going on with the entropy we know

1464
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,079
there's a value for entropy that

1465
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,680
entropy goes

1466
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,240
changes in from ice to water

1467
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,160
but you know even

1468
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,920
richard feynman used to say well no one

1469
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,680
quite knows what's going on there and

1470
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,119
maybe this is

1471
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,200
something that you're trying to get into

1472
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,960
is what's going on in those phase

1473
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,240
transitions

1474
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,880
and these entropic changes which

1475
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,799
doesn't have the benefit like you say of

1476
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,799
some a gentle

1477
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,799
driver of the free energy principle to

1478
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,799
make it happen so i don't know what your

1479
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,640
thoughts are but how that might even how

1480
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,559
that might be useful

1481
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,040
to help people who aren't as heavily

1482
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,599
into physics just think about the idea

1483
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,640
of

1484
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,440
change and entropy because i think it's

1485
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,200
it's going to become of something that

1486
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,520
more and more people are using

1487
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,640
outside of physics

1488
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,839
if you have any

1489
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,079
dots otherwise just the maximum density

1490
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,559
is 4 c for water

1491
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,880
and it's super super slight but a very

1492
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,760
interesting pattern

1493
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,400
okay

1494
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,920
we can turn to well if anyone wants to

1495
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,799
raise their hand um or

1496
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,000
give a thought

1497
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,520
um

1498
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,040
stephen you said like that the neg

1499
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,440
entropy as like it might not exist that

1500
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
was one thing and there's no such thing

1501
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,960
as entropy

1502
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,799
well you know yeah i also wanted to

1503
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,440
sorry about about that

1504
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,559
i

1505
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,440
yeah i also wanted to to stress that in

1506
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,520
equilibrium phase transitions in physics

1507
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,200
you don't use the notion of negative

1508
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,839
energy of course you just use entropy

1509
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,000
and standard statistical mechanics plus

1510
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,440
three normalization group methods

1511
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,920
so that my

1512
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,200
might be

1513
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,359
an asymmetry with some of the case

1514
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,559
studies that i analyzed in biology but

1515
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,400
yeah we'll see

1516
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,799
and one of the fundamental tradeoffs

1517
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,680
discussed in the paper um was this

1518
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,319
generality versus the plausibility and

1519
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,440
the realism

1520
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,480
do attractors even exist or is it just

1521
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,599
as if

1522
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,920
a system is moving towards something but

1523
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,319
does does something that

1524
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,880
is not realized exists

1525
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,599
and so this kind of uh takes us into

1526
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,960
talking about

1527
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,960
uh whether we're describing the system

1528
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,480
as it is or rather situating the system

1529
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,960
in a broader space of how it could exist

1530
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,480
and that was one of the fundamental

1531
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,400
points of the paper about the challenges

1532
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,319
of discovering the appropriate phase

1533
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,720
space for a biological

1534
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,760
system

1535
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,960
so

1536
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,920
um

1537
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,079
it's just cool because these are

1538
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:30,960
not

1539
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,880
knock down punches

1540
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,760
for fep and active

1541
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,599
nor are they trivial

1542
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,040
they're in that

1543
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,240
optimally informative or a confusing

1544
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,160
space you know between zero and one

1545
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,520
probability

1546
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,319
where

1547
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,839
it does matter

1548
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,240
and uh where philosophy comes into play

1549
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,119
and

1550
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,119
where the the specifics of the situation

1551
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,440
come into play we can't just simply make

1552
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,760
um

1553
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,359
arguments without reference to a

1554
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,400
specific

1555
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,280
model

1556
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,119
but then are we trapped to just

1557
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,280
describing specific models specific

1558
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,200
papers or are we able to

1559
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,480
go beyond that ever

1560
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,079
i'm just looking through um if anyone

1561
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,640
wants to raise their hand or any yeah

1562
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,720
about that sorry

1563
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,160
uh so

1564
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,200
we do

1565
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,680
rise a concern about the existence of

1566
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,960
attractors

1567
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,440
uh of course attractors don't exist in

1568
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,520
nature yeah because you need you need

1569
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,200
taking infinite limits in order to

1570
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
define attractors in a model and you

1571
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,079
cannot so infinites are not realistic

1572
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,000
right so we cannot take

1573
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
systems don't don't take an infinite

1574
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
amount or processes don't take anything

1575
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,440
out of time and

1576
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,920
uh you cannot repeat an iteration in

1577
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,599
renormalization group transformation

1578
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,599
infinitely many times in a

1579
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,359
in a realistic way of course these are

1580
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,680
all idealizations but in principle i

1581
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,599
wanted to to stress that we don't have

1582
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,000
we don't have a problem with that so of

1583
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,160
course any model that uses attractors

1584
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,280
wouldn't be

1585
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,000
realistic in a way so you will be using

1586
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,240
an idealization that's true

1587
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,559
but we don't have a problem with that if

1588
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,119
the idealization can be justified i

1589
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,119
think in many cases especially for

1590
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,880
example in

1591
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,920
in

1592
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,079
in the treatment of phase transitions in

1593
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,880
in physics where you use uh limits

1594
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,880
there's a way of justifying those limits

1595
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,400
and justifying the existence of

1596
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,880
attractors and therefore

1597
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,280
even if you miss some realism in the

1598
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,000
model of your of your physical system

1599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,079
since that idealization is justified

1600
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,160
that that is plausible so that that

1601
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,960
model is plausible and it's legitimate

1602
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,839
what we are what we are

1603
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,000
worried about in the paper is that it

1604
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,480
might happen that sometimes uh the

1605
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,440
models that well they try to model

1606
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,599
many systems in terms of attractions are

1607
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,240
not realistic they cannot justify the

1608
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
idealizations that are being made in

1609
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,480
order to model many plenty of systems in

1610
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,559
terms of attractors

1611
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,880
so i just wanted to clarify that because

1612
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,359
we don't disagree in principle with the

1613
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,640
idea of of using models that appeal to

1614
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,720
attractors even if attractions don't

1615
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,040
exist in reality our problem is well

1616
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,480
with the possibility of finding

1617
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,720
attractors in the first place or finding

1618
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,480
asymptotic solutions

1619
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,280
and the second is about the possibility

1620
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,359
of justifying the idealizations that are

1621
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,599
involved when you use

1622
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,440
attractors or when you appeal to

1623
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,960
attractors

1624
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,319
yes and like many other

1625
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,000
arguments in biology it's a little bit

1626
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
like the anthropic principle or fallacy

1627
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,000
depending on which side you're on it's

1628
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,960
like

1629
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,640
you mentioned in the paper you have to

1630
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,960
prove the existence of the attractor as

1631
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,880
well as as we discuss the time to

1632
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,599
conversions and then justify why certain

1633
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,880
attractors

1634
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,440
denote homeostatic states and one

1635
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,319
biologist's answer is just those are the

1636
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,520
living systems if the attractor weren't

1637
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,760
a homeostatic state or a high fitness

1638
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,720
state

1639
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,880
that is not going to be an ant you see

1640
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,079
around for long and so we can just say

1641
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,880
that if there is an attractor and indeed

1642
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,200
it's as if there's an attractor for

1643
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,520
persistent systems that's the adaptive

1644
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,839
one period and the second that it's not

1645
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,880
that way

1646
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,039
the system fails to exist so that's the

1647
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,039
sort of circular

1648
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,359
but often impenetrable tautology of

1649
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,000
selection and persistence of systems

1650
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,240
blue

1651
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,440
so that's a nice uh transition perhaps

1652
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,039
into the question that i've had about um

1653
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,680
dynamic equilibrium versus a

1654
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,480
non-equilibrium steady state density so

1655
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,680
i don't know if you want to flip to that

1656
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,240
side daniel but um there there's you

1657
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,720
know several quotes in the paper where

1658
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,520
um

1659
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,559
the

1660
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,720
the i'm not sure exactly what's referred

1661
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,760
to um as a dynamic equilibrium i'm

1662
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,000
assuming that it's uh

1663
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,599
homeostasis

1664
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:00,799
but um

1665
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,200
i just was wondering why because a

1666
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,520
dynamic equilibrium is um

1667
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,559
a reversible chemical reaction

1668
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,680
and there's nothing about homeostasis

1669
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,520
that is i mean there may be some things

1670
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,119
but not everything about maintaining

1671
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,640
homeostasis

1672
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,400
is has to do with reversibility um so i

1673
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,880
just was um wondering

1674
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,960
uh all biological systems actively

1675
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,640
maintain a dynamic equilibrium with

1676
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,799
their environment and what is meant by

1677
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,799
that

1678
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,000
this was a quote from the

1679
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
paper

1680
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,599
oh wait you're muted patricia but if you

1681
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,559
have any thoughts

1682
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,119
yeah so sorry i i was missing the screen

1683
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,160
somehow disappeared everything

1684
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,359
uh yeah blue so actually unfortunately

1685
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,760
matteo wanted to answer that

1686
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,119
in a in a

1687
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,039
in a neat way uh basically we took this

1688
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,079
from from freestone himself so he refers

1689
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,000
in many places and he had the quotations

1690
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,200
and so and i don't have that at the

1691
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,920
moment i can try to look at it but

1692
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,799
in a so you might be right it's not the

1693
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,880
right way of of describing the

1694
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,119
homostatic states but i think it's a

1695
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,760
mistake that that freestone himself does

1696
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,839
i think so this is basically what what

1697
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,200
matteo wanted to to say and he had these

1698
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,280
quotations in the papers where he does

1699
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,000
that

1700
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,359
so

1701
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,680
if you want to email him he will he will

1702
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,720
address you to those words but not no so

1703
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,000
not so much

1704
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,319
in our paper depends on that notion

1705
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,160
actually so that might be a mistake that

1706
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,680
we make i think because we need to give

1707
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,160
freestyle

1708
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,359
but not so much depends on that so

1709
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,000
basically our criticisms have to do with

1710
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,760
the idea of modeling

1711
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,680
um

1712
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,160
all biological states in terms of random

1713
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,839
dynamical systems

1714
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,400
in understanding homostatic states in

1715
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,280
terms of dynamical attractors as they

1716
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,359
are described in the paper

1717
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,640
but

1718
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,880
we don't rely so much on the notion of

1719
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,720
dynamic equilibrium so that might be

1720
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,640
just a loose way of

1721
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,319
of understanding uh homostatic states so

1722
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,400
it's referring to homeostasis though not

1723
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,960
a dynamic testing okay yes yes yes

1724
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,520
tumustasis yes yes

1725
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,000
thank you stephen

1726
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,319
i mean this could be an interesting

1727
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,039
area for the for the ontological work

1728
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,440
that's happening in the lab because

1729
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,960
this question of

1730
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,319
you know is it

1731
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,920
dynamic equilibrium i think like blue

1732
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,440
was saying there can

1733
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,559
can be that kind of backwards and

1734
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,400
forwards of which there's maybe a bit

1735
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,760
more of an arrow in one direction and

1736
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
then you've maybe got

1737
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,680
the word equilibrium as opposed to

1738
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,680
non-equilibrium

1739
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,200
and then you've got this so he has this

1740
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
term dynamical

1741
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,960
systems you know

1742
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,079
um

1743
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,839
and um

1744
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,920
as opposed to system dynamics which is

1745
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,960
the kind of the way that say chemistry

1746
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,359
like equilibrium work is more system

1747
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,400
dynamics for dynamical systems

1748
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,480
um and you've got this interesting thing

1749
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,640
because you've got this non-linear

1750
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,599
dynamical work happening at the sort of

1751
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,200
the the the

1752
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,839
physics level and this emerging property

1753
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,160
level and then at some point

1754
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,039
um

1755
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,200
as it appears from the organism's

1756
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,480
perspective

1757
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,160
we might start turning and using the

1758
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,319
language of dynamic equilibrium

1759
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,559
ecologically you know or ecological

1760
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,839
equilibrium

1761
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,119
and this this shifting

1762
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,960
the way that the

1763
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,559
ontologies are present which may be true

1764
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,760
because as things persist and interacted

1765
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,079
with as entities

1766
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,480
um they they appear to be

1767
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,440
you know

1768
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,240
in

1769
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,559
a different type of dynamic but we are

1770
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,000
seeing from

1771
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
the active inference that that dynamic

1772
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,799
may

1773
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,520
in itself be more dynamical than we

1774
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,799
perceive

1775
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,079
so i don't know i just thought i'd

1776
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,200
mention

1777
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,039
um i don't know if we need an answer to

1778
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:21,839
that

1779
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,760
or maybe daniel you've got a thought but

1780
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,440
there's something about

1781
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,240
um

1782
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,400
this shift between biology and

1783
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
physics at the sort of

1784
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,880
at this sort of very um

1785
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,319
molecular stroke um you know theoretical

1786
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,200
level

1787
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,119
and then you've got the idea of what

1788
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,559
that means for biology and then you've

1789
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,839
got the idea of what that means for

1790
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,160
biological organisms

1791
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,200
um

1792
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,839
and maybe this is something that we've

1793
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,640
talked about this pluralistic ontology

1794
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,920
that needs to be

1795
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,880
feasible in the field because

1796
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,599
like say it depends i think that was

1797
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,760
a very good point it does depend on

1798
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,880
where your

1799
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,640
models are based and grounded

1800
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,400
thanks

1801
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,200
mateo has some very interesting work on

1802
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,240
pluralism in biology and the philosophy

1803
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,719
of science so i'd recommend people look

1804
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,679
there

1805
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,880
now

1806
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,399
contingent explanations are not

1807
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,399
necessarily plural one can be an

1808
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,839
absolutist and say it depends on the

1809
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:25,839
particulars and there's only one correct

1810
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,719
story so it's an open question to what

1811
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,279
extent pluralism and particularity will

1812
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,560
coexist

1813
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,319
and agreed that

1814
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,080
at the high level

1815
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,359
as we

1816
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,920
mix metaphors take ideas across

1817
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,759
different fields

1818
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,080
we have to be aware of what is gained

1819
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,520
and lost what are the challenges and

1820
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,158
opportunities of applying

1821
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,640
terms from mathematics to physics

1822
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,279
and from physics to biology and taking

1823
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,560
us all the way up and down that xkcd

1824
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,080
comic that we were um looking at earlier

1825
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,120
one

1826
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,000
question area patricia that i had was

1827
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,960
about

1828
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,198
action in the loop

1829
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,880
so

1830
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,759
uh

1831
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,839
maybe there's two parts to it the first

1832
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:15,439
is just we often hear about fep as being

1833
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,158
akin to a principle of least action

1834
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:19,198
so just

1835
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,439
from a physics background

1836
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,080
what does it mean to be a principle of

1837
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,839
least action or what would it mean to be

1838
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,399
like a principle of least action

1839
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,158
and then um

1840
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:31,040
how

1841
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,799
does it uh change the formalisms or not

1842
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,920
when we're integrating control

1843
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,000
of behavior kind of control theory

1844
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,080
formalisms or cybernetics

1845
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,439
into

1846
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,238
ensembl modeling

1847
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,839
because the actions of molecules are

1848
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,719
implicit in the phase transition of

1849
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,439
the ensemble of water but what happens

1850
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,280
when we actually have a control

1851
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,560
parameter

1852
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,040
in our equations

1853
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,280
like policy

1854
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,800
okay thank you so first of all i did

1855
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,960
find the papers where where frison uses

1856
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,280
the notion of dynamic equilibrium so for

1857
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,560
for blue

1858
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,239
and he uses a synonym of of homeostasis

1859
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,040
but i i cannot use the chat can you oh

1860
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,080
it's on the left side uh the bottom left

1861
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,159
it says that enter a nickname to use the

1862
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,320
chat you can pick up whatever you want

1863
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,239
okay

1864
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,800
it was kind of possible okay

1865
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,520
call me trim tab

1866
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,960
okay

1867
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,199
okay it was so i thought it was it was

1868
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,280
sort of a password so you just wanted to

1869
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,600
allow everyone to write in the chat it

1870
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,360
doesn't require a child name but

1871
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,560
okay

1872
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,360
good

1873
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,199
these are the papers blue so you can

1874
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,719
take a look at this so yeah

1875
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,120
but as i said not so not so much in our

1876
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,440
paper it depends on that notion of that

1877
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,440
so you might disagree with that lack of

1878
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,920
record there

1879
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,480
but yeah and don't blame us for that we

1880
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,600
just okay

1881
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,400
nice that was it interestingly not in a

1882
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,880
peer review paper not that it

1883
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,640
explains everything but he may be

1884
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,400
speaking maybe yeah informally in this

1885
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,679
aon piece

1886
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,440
exactly i think i think it's just uh

1887
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,440
yeah a more loose way of talking about

1888
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,960
it and we also use it because it's

1889
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,320
useful then when you speak about

1890
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,159
dynamical attractors so if you have a

1891
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,480
notion of dynamic equilibrium it's just

1892
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,719
uh useful but of course we were we

1893
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,440
weren't thinking about the the the the

1894
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,520
proper definition of dynamical

1895
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,360
equilibrium

1896
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,600
so good now just return the action

1897
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,800
question yeah okay

1898
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,920
okay so yeah

1899
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,400
again so we are here so sorry that i

1900
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,280
excuse myself of summarizing the work

1901
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,040
that frison did

1902
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,280
uh but here we are just summarizing so

1903
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,880
we don't give a proper definition of

1904
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,960
principle of list action we're just

1905
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,080
relying on on friston's own definition

1906
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,000
and he basically in that paper of 2012

1907
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,640
he needs the principle of of least

1908
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,880
action in order to formulate the free

1909
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,640
energy principles so the principle of

1910
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,719
least action is a step

1911
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,040
an intermediate step in order to

1912
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,199
formulate the free energy principle

1913
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,480
nothing more

1914
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,560
then i would be more careful in talking

1915
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,199
about principles of list action in in

1916
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,280
the fa in phase transitions in physics i

1917
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,640
think

1918
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,679
you might

1919
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,920
not even require any principle of list

1920
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,239
action there you might talk about those

1921
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:33,520
uh ground states as principle as uh sort

1922
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,159
of

1923
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,920
relying on a principle of less action

1924
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,920
but i would be more careful about uh

1925
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,080
exporting that notion to to the physics

1926
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,040
of phase transition

1927
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,440
okay

1928
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,960
what's that kept up

1929
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,880
yes so that's the first part about the

1930
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,920
principle of least action and then just

1931
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,120
is there um something that is changed

1932
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,199
markedly when we introduce

1933
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,440
these control theoretic

1934
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,840
formalisms like policy selection

1935
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,080
into physical

1936
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,880
physically inspired or based

1937
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,000
models

1938
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,679
that entail activity like the thermal

1939
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,000
motion of particles but are not

1940
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,560
approached from a control theoretic or

1941
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,320
behavioral regulatory perspective

1942
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,280
are you thinking about social systems

1943
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,920
for example

1944
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,880
perhaps different kinds of systems but

1945
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,960
um mainly just a

1946
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,520
uh a particular system

1947
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,080
uh in the way that uh free energy

1948
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,760
principle for a particular physics for

1949
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,120
students 2019 work like the particle is

1950
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,880
the blanket and the internal states

1951
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,199
that's engaging in active inference

1952
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,320
let's say

1953
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,000
and so it

1954
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,760
is implementing inference on policy it's

1955
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,920
selecting policy it's behaving and so

1956
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,600
is that sort of policy selection latent

1957
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,199
within

1958
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,400
non-controlled theoretic

1959
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,840
activity-based physics models

1960
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,120
again like the thermal motion of

1961
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,480
molecules or when we introduce policy

1962
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,920
inference

1963
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,719
does that change some of the

1964
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,920
qualities of the system

1965
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,960
i i think so it's an interesting

1966
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,400
question i would need to think about

1967
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,800
that a about it more carefully but my

1968
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,600
intuition is that it does it changes the

1969
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,719
the way uh i still understand uh phase

1970
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,040
transitions in physics

1971
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,800
um

1972
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,320
i think that requires changing formalism

1973
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,679
and again it requires uh important well

1974
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,679
making important difference in your in

1975
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,480
your model with respect to to how you

1976
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,440
model phase transitions in physics

1977
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,640
thanks

1978
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,960
i agree something changes and it's not

1979
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,360
for linear time discussion necessarily

1980
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,360
to unpack but these are the kinds of

1981
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,960
questions that we're getting at

1982
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,719
absolutely so blue

1983
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,199
yes yes i think

1984
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,640
so um i just want to reference the um

1985
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,560
articles that you posted in in the chat

1986
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,040
so the am thing they did say dynamic

1987
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,679
equilibrium but like i like don't

1988
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,960
trust like op-ed science writers to

1989
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,239
make direct uh correct quotations um and

1990
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,480
in the ramstead paper that was cited in

1991
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,800
your paper the markov blankets of life

1992
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,280
it specifies that dynamic equilibrium

1993
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,040
specifically is not

1994
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,360
the state of homeostasis it says the

1995
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,120
very existence of living systems can

1996
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,040
therefore be construed as a process of

1997
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,679
boundary conservation where the boundary

1998
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,239
of a system is its markov blanket that

1999
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,239
means that the dependencies induced by

2000
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,640
the presence of a markov blanket are

2001
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,239
what keep the system far removed from

2002
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,920
thermodynamical equilibrium not to be

2003
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,640
confused with dynamic equilibrium so i

2004
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,360
mean specifically like there it's not

2005
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,840
dynamic equilibrium it's it's far from

2006
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,239
thermodynamic equilibrium but but still

2007
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,400
dynamic equilibrium is is not not a part

2008
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,080
of that and so that's why that reference

2009
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,400
was very um confusing to me and like

2010
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,800
they on paper is like yeah

2011
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,960
like yeah and then we made the same

2012
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,560
mistake that that he made without

2013
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,760
correcting it

2014
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,760
in the way that

2015
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,159
it can be so i i agree we were talking

2016
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,320
loosely there and we were what we were

2017
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,760
having in mind was the notion of

2018
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,400
dynamical attractors so that's why we

2019
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,600
found uh dynamic equilibrium very very

2020
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,040
like a a nice term but but we might be

2021
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,199
talking loosely there but as i said so

2022
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,199
that might be a mistake

2023
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,400
but um not so much in our paper depends

2024
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,080
on that notion

2025
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,560
well so and the notion of a tractor in

2026
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,440
the

2027
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,280
in the state of homeostasis is

2028
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,679
specifically a far from equilibrium

2029
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,040
removed

2030
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,600
space that a biological system exists in

2031
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,520
and so it's just kind of um

2032
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,960
yeah confusing to me i thought

2033
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,600
interesting um

2034
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,719
you know it's a challenge to say enough

2035
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,120
to identify

2036
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,760
what we're talking about but especially

2037
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,719
when we're

2038
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,120
crossing disciplinary

2039
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,480
boundaries

2040
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,599
to know which

2041
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,840
pieces of baggage make it through one

2042
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,120
border or another like dynamical

2043
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,000
could merely just mean involving time

2044
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,880
but

2045
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,640
it also brings on a lot more meaning in

2046
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,159
different areas

2047
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,400
um

2048
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,719
it's a great yes so we talk we talk in

2049
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,239
the paper about the possibility of uh

2050
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,560
attractors like that change well one

2051
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,719
attractor following another so we

2052
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,120
understood that as a loosely as a notion

2053
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,520
of dynamic equilibrium but you are

2054
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,600
not using the term rigorously probably

2055
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,400
here

2056
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,360
let's turn in the um sort of home

2057
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,520
stretch of however long we want to speak

2058
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,880
to the

2059
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,840
short and concise conclusion

2060
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,800
so

2061
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,000
you you

2062
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,840
in the last paragraph brought up this

2063
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
really interesting point

2064
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,960
about the fep as a definition

2065
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,320
for a system

2066
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,400
and so um

2067
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,920
i wondered

2068
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,640
what else could it be or might be what

2069
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,840
might we want a framework to be other

2070
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,040
than a definition like what else

2071
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,719
in the counter factuals of the way that

2072
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,960
this paragraph could have been written

2073
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,800
what else could the fep or another

2074
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,480
framework be other than a definition

2075
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,880
is that synonymous or complementary with

2076
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,800
a description

2077
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,600
with

2078
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,920
what other pieces come into play here

2079
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,760
can you can you repeat the question i

2080
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,760
don't know if i understood it um if the

2081
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,199
fep

2082
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,080
uh

2083
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,920
is not a definition what else could it

2084
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,840
be

2085
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,480
or other than a definition what do we

2086
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
want for a full

2087
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:08,159
pledged model principle

2088
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,960
what would make it a principle i think

2089
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,760
uh

2090
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,040
something that can be can explain

2091
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,800
life or it can explain um

2092
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,480
yeah why why why uh

2093
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,679
biological systems uh

2094
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,400
apparently violate the second law why do

2095
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,400
they stay in that

2096
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,159
far from equilibrium steady state

2097
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:37,120
i think uh many

2098
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,120
defenders or advocates of the

2099
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,280
applicators of the free energy principle

2100
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,360
understand this sort of as a principle

2101
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,120
that explained that has explanatory

2102
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,000
power

2103
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,440
that explains the the the

2104
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,520
not only the existence even the

2105
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,760
existence of living systems but

2106
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,679
especially why those

2107
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,120
living systems

2108
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,080
stay

2109
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,120
uh

2110
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,640
far from

2111
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,600
from

2112
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,600
equilibrium or from from maxwell

2113
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,520
boltzmann equilibrium

2114
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,679
for a long time in a in a steady state

2115
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,040
great

2116
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,480
point so

2117
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,400
yeah that's smart

2118
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,800
and explanation which of course goes

2119
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,239
beyond or is complementary to definition

2120
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,760
explanation is one of the key

2121
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,600
terms and themes in the history of the

2122
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,280
philosophy of science

2123
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,080
and

2124
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,120
since an explanation is evaluated

2125
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,360
subjectively or inter-subjectively like

2126
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,600
was that an adequate explanation

2127
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,480
that's a statement about the

2128
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,080
relationship between

2129
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,440
a perceiver and the explanation itself

2130
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,440
and so it uh dumps the entire mess back

2131
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,520
into the lap of almost a

2132
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,280
psycho-historical

2133
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,080
perspective on science because

2134
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,400
good explanation is about the

2135
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,199
enculturation of the person evaluating

2136
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,920
how good that explanation is so steven

2137
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,560
and then blue

2138
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,440
yeah i was just um looking up regarding

2139
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,440
dynamical and dynamics so

2140
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,880
dynamical the

2141
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,400
adjective means relating to the study of

2142
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,159
dynamics

2143
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,639
so it says a dynamic system is a system

2144
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,280
exhibiting continual change

2145
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,440
so a dynamic system is continual change

2146
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,639
a dynamical system is a system

2147
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,760
relating to the study of the dynamics

2148
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,000
so a dynamical system is like a system

2149
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,520
working with

2150
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,440
the dynamics of

2151
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,080
a system and

2152
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,840
dynamic itself just talks about the

2153
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,120
actual fact that there's change

2154
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,159
happening

2155
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,239
so that's kind of um

2156
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,520
that's kind of interesting and be

2157
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,800
interesting as well whether you get

2158
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,719
dynamical things

2159
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,120
or there has to be systems you know like

2160
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,840
the the the

2161
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,239
the the is there

2162
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,679
that may be where there's some sort of

2163
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,719
interesting play between

2164
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,280
uh phase transitions as well like maybe

2165
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,320
there's some

2166
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,000
there's a dynamic going on is there a

2167
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,400
dynamic that is second order to the

2168
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,040
first dynamic in some way so that that's

2169
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,199
kind of interesting yes

2170
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,040
things and processes

2171
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,800
and static

2172
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,440
versus dynamic and then

2173
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,639
loose

2174
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,760
but acceptable in many cases use of

2175
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,880
language

2176
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,159
and um

2177
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,880
again the text modeling

2178
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,000
will be

2179
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,960
superlative when we can establish where

2180
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,639
these adjectives and nouns and verbs

2181
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,120
are being used appropriately versus

2182
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,480
inappropriately

2183
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,480
um or at the very least

2184
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,560
suggesting more precision or less

2185
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,159
precision than

2186
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,159
uh warranted

2187
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,120
so blue

2188
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,719
oh and dave has a great comment there

2189
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,000
historical

2190
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,080
examined by historians using founded

2191
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,560
methods versus historic which is like

2192
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,400
about the event itself like it was a

2193
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,320
historic victory or something like that

2194
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,800
so it's uh interesting how we give the

2195
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,440
disciplinary nod with that al

2196
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,400
on the adjective

2197
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,520
um i was just thinking about the

2198
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,520
difference like linguistically between

2199
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,800
historic and hysteric

2200
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,920
like what might what might that be um so

2201
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,800
i my question unrelated to historics and

2202
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,880
hysterics um really goes back to um you

2203
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,800
know what patricia was saying about the

2204
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,199
second law and touches back to

2205
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,199
what stephen was saying earlier about um

2206
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:42,400
the non-existence of negative entropy

2207
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,199
and and um you know i'm i'm curious

2208
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,679
about that because i think um

2209
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,280
you know

2210
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,280
a lot of the fep is is um grounded in

2211
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,400
information dynamics which depends

2212
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,480
greatly on the existence of negative

2213
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,840
entropy like the minimization of

2214
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,679
surprise uh in the terms of information

2215
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,719
theory so i i was wondering if physics

2216
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,639
and information theory are are different

2217
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,560
are they one and the same what are the

2218
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,920
differences how do we clarify them and

2219
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,480
similarly um you know one of the claims

2220
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,280
in the paper is to pay attention to the

2221
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,280
differences between physics and biology

2222
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,199
and what you know i've always thought

2223
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,000
that

2224
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,920
the laws of physics are universally

2225
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,120
applicable

2226
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,199
and and perhaps

2227
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,280
they're not but but

2228
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,360
um i i think that they should be and you

2229
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,199
know that this defiance of the second

2230
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,600
law like are do the laws of physics not

2231
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,080
apply in biology in biological systems

2232
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,800
and

2233
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,840
um is is it negative entropy that that

2234
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,920
biological systems do i mean scott david

2235
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,639
always classically refers to the entropy

2236
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,920
secretion

2237
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,800
of you know biological systems and so i

2238
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,120
just was wondering how do we reconcile

2239
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,800
these differences maybe

2240
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,400
if you guys have thoughts

2241
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,000
yeah great questions stephen you want to

2242
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,239
go on that topic or

2243
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,760
yeah i think i think there's a really

2244
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,800
good

2245
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,199
i think this is important because

2246
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,960
you see

2247
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,480
neg entropy

2248
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,960
kind of is a bit like

2249
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,960
negative enthalpy in the way it's

2250
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,639
formulated i

2251
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,560
but the thing is

2252
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,400
you have a reduction

2253
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,639
only relative

2254
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,920
to a starting state starting equilibrium

2255
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,560
state in terms of entropy it's it might

2256
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,480
have gone down in terms of a starting

2257
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,040
state but it's not actually

2258
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,960
lower in

2259
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,360
like energy is energy right you it can't

2260
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,440
be made can't be lost

2261
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,719
you know but the entropy

2262
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,960
you can have a variation in the entropy

2263
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,280
and that variation can be noisy going up

2264
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,639
and down you can then extract

2265
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,159
information

2266
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,320
um you can have things which are more

2267
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,639
ordered now that's fair enough you can

2268
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,159
have more order but neg entropy

2269
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:02,560
um isn't something which is

2270
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,880
a value in that way

2271
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,040
it's just a convenient

2272
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,840
piece of

2273
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,400
temporary

2274
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,239
mathematics

2275
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,760
to help see whether you're going to have

2276
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,880
a force

2277
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,480
driving or reducing a reaction

2278
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,440
which so that's where the challenge is

2279
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,280
because it's you're getting it from the

2280
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,440
variations not from

2281
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,760
something which is an equilibrium state

2282
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,360
because as soon as you say neg entropy

2283
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,960
it makes it sound like it's sitting

2284
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,639
there with a particular amount of

2285
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:35,760
entropy

2286
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,120
that makes sense

2287
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,000
um and it's not really like that

2288
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,840
so this this is this is like one of the

2289
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,159
kind of

2290
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:48,480
misunderstandings i think around

2291
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,400
entropy okay interesting um one other

2292
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,840
view blue on your

2293
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,679
question about information and

2294
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,920
thermodynamics

2295
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,600
we have some very

2296
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,120
slam dunk

2297
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,040
info thermo

2298
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,480
synthesis

2299
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,400
on the processor scale

2300
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,440
like the amount of heat that is emitted

2301
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,639
or absorbed by certain very very

2302
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,560
granular atomic

2303
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,239
in multiple senses

2304
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,400
informational transitions

2305
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,239
and so it's almost like

2306
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,320
that's like the the stem

2307
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,000
and there's that we know that there is a

2308
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,840
connection there

2309
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,000
um either

2310
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,120
as if

2311
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,400
to be sure

2312
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,520
if not in actuality so map and territory

2313
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,800
information and thermodynamics

2314
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,560
potentially coming together

2315
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,159
and part of our

2316
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,320
curiosity and drive with active

2317
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,360
inference

2318
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,480
is whether

2319
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,719
info dynamics

2320
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,280
might apply to higher orders of

2321
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,560
organization

2322
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,239
and whether we can use some of these

2323
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,120
models and ideas to describe

2324
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,320
informational patterns and thermodynamic

2325
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,280
eventually even bioenergetic

2326
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,440
patterns and phenomena

2327
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,440
beyond the cpu

2328
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,520
and that's where

2329
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,360
it's going to be this question of okay

2330
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,760
maybe we generalize

2331
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,520
and it's useful

2332
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,920
but we've lost some reality touch so the

2333
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,679
parameter

2334
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,520
a temperature parameter on decision

2335
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,159
making doesn't refer to

2336
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,120
the thermometer reading of the brain

2337
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,320
i think we're okay with that so in a way

2338
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,000
we are lifting

2339
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,159
away from the physical grounding

2340
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,080
because we're using terms like

2341
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,360
temperature

2342
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,400
entropy

2343
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,000
in their information and not their

2344
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,960
physical

2345
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,560
capacity

2346
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,760
and as the key questions raised in this

2347
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,440
paper um

2348
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,400
brought to this discussion

2349
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,560
there are opportunities and challenges

2350
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,760
with making those kinds of

2351
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,239
generalizations it's not just a simple

2352
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,360
win

2353
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,480
it's things are gained things are lost

2354
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,800
some things come into resolution other

2355
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,159
things become

2356
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,320
incapable of being resolved

2357
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,679
so that's like the

2358
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,920
some of the excellent questions

2359
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,800
that

2360
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,520
i think the paper brings to the table

2361
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,800
and it combines those questions

2362
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,120
along with just

2363
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,800
tantalizingly

2364
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,040
a look at the history

2365
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,800
and the development of

2366
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,040
active inference as a framework

2367
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,080
and so we can be clear about which

2368
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,639
papers said what when

2369
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,400
and then where are we headed what would

2370
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,239
be our preferences

2371
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:35,280
for

2372
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,480
a thermodynamic model of decision making

2373
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,800
will we only succeed when it's about the

2374
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,920
temperature of the brain

2375
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,679
it might be for some person

2376
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,080
however other people might just say

2377
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,239
if there is a temperature-like parameter

2378
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,760
in the sense that that parameter's

2379
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,120
formalism looks like temperature

2380
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,520
of water in a test tube

2381
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,560
then

2382
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,639
we have something that's already useful

2383
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,080
and interesting

2384
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,960
and

2385
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,800
that's where

2386
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,560
the train ends for me

2387
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,719
and then somebody else may continue to

2388
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,480
build the rails

2389
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,120
off towards wondering whether

2390
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,760
is it metaphysically a temperature of

2391
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,679
decision making all these other areas

2392
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,520
that people can take it

2393
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,400
um

2394
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,679
and so

2395
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,760
it's this trade-off between realism for

2396
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,480
generality and utility that we've come

2397
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,679
to these

2398
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,800
uh meta modeling discussions before

2399
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,920
in number 14 and beyond

2400
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,199
okay

2401
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,960
um

2402
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,080
anyone wants to ask a question in the

2403
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,239
chat or raise their hand here

2404
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:45,600
otherwise let's see

2405
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,600
back to our dot one

2406
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,520
questions and see if there's any threads

2407
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,280
from dot one

2408
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,000
that we want to just um

2409
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,520
recap or see if we have a different

2410
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,199
perspective on

2411
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:00,320
and then we can just sort of

2412
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,360
close

2413
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,960
the dot 2 and

2414
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,159
jump off into

2415
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,159
the next steps so

2416
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:08,880
in

2417
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,040
one

2418
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,280
we started with some questions again

2419
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,360
from a more history of fep and active

2420
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,560
about

2421
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,280
in what ways has physics

2422
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,719
been

2423
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,360
used to investigate the fep

2424
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,360
we talked a little bit about

2425
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,280
how the decosta paper that was 26

2426
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,639
bayesian mechanics for stationary

2427
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:33,760
processes

2428
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,840
relates to the erogedicity stationarity

2429
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,280
discussion

2430
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,239
or not we'll see

2431
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,960
we talked about then and also a little

2432
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,560
bit today

2433
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,280
is the fep a theory of life well in the

2434
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,040
conclusion it was said to be a

2435
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,159
definition

2436
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,600
and we talked about some other things it

2437
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,480
could be blue

2438
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,560
so you still have to unmute you'd think

2439
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,560
i i would learn after all this time um

2440
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,520
never learn don't change

2441
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,840
the um the ergonomy thing i think maybe

2442
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,120
you guys discussed that uh before i got

2443
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,520
here but but i think like one of the the

2444
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,920
points that was made in this paper um

2445
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,239
addressing the ergodicity and the fact

2446
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,719
that um

2447
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,360
you know biological systems are are i

2448
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,280
mean i don't think can i don't think

2449
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,280
biological systems can be described as

2450
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,280
as ergotic and this is a discussion that

2451
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,000
that daniel and i have had many times um

2452
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,280
i mean sure within a very restricted

2453
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,480
space

2454
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,560
like you know my body temperature for

2455
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,639
example in the range from i mean what

2456
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,199
can i survive like 105 fahrenheit

2457
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:44,000
probably and you know maybe 95

2458
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,679
fahrenheit so i have like this 10 degree

2459
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,760
range and i'm sure at some point in my

2460
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,840
lifetime i'll visit all the space within

2461
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,159
that range because you can't skip over

2462
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,719
you don't go from 96 to 100

2463
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,960
and skip any of the points in between so

2464
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,199
like you know it's incrementally like of

2465
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,320
course i'll visit all of that space um

2466
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,560
and so i i do think that that that's an

2467
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,960
important question but um yeah that was

2468
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,400
really um

2469
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,320
addressed by de costa in in that uh 26

2470
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,560
live stream um about you know

2471
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,920
homeostasis is

2472
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,080
a quasi stationary because it's not

2473
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,480
perfectly stationary right it's like a

2474
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,199
it's a squishy stationary but it's not

2475
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,719
you know it doesn't it doesn't sample

2476
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,400
the entire we don't sample the entire

2477
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,600
state space of say temperature um you

2478
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,440
know as a biological system that must

2479
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,040
maintain a certain temperature so i

2480
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,880
think that that was resolved but did you

2481
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,880
guys discuss that before i got here

2482
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,800
not the boundedness per se

2483
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,320
but

2484
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,200
potentially some

2485
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,320
[Music]

2486
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,560
relevant pieces about arrogancy and

2487
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,560
stationarity

2488
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,400
um yeah so may i say something sorry

2489
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,480
though yeah i have to turn off the video

2490
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,320
i'm with my baby here

2491
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,960
hello baby um

2492
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,239
yeah

2493
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,800
um yeah so we didn't we i agree with you

2494
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,719
blue i think that's one of the things

2495
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,120
that we that we discussed in the paper

2496
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,199
so it's very problematic to understand

2497
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,080
biological systems such as body systems

2498
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,520
uh but uh in the discussion last week

2499
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,600
you were saying or maxwell was saying

2500
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,480
that

2501
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,159
new formulations of the free energy

2502
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,600
principle don't

2503
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,440
rely on that assumptions that they

2504
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,040
dropped that assumption in the new

2505
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,320
formulations of the free energy

2506
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,440
principle

2507
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,960
and what i was saying

2508
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,520
before today is that it's still in new

2509
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,960
formulations of the free energy

2510
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,159
principle

2511
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,800
they rely on the existence of weakly

2512
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,199
mixing random dynamical systems and to

2513
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,600
my understanding mixing systems require

2514
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,040
ergodicity anyhow so it's not clear that

2515
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,280
they have really dropped the assumption

2516
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,679
in the new formulations and if so i

2517
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,679
would like to see exactly how the

2518
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,040
framework can work without the

2519
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,440
assumption of erodicity i haven't seen

2520
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,280
that explicitly i

2521
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,880
my belief that that can be done but i

2522
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,239
would like to to see it

2523
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,000
and

2524
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,920
we don't evade requirements just by not

2525
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,280
mentioning them

2526
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,320
so it's about what papers do mention as

2527
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,239
well as reading between lines between

2528
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,719
the formalisms between the citations

2529
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,520
to really what is the bedrock

2530
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,400
or

2531
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,880
tautology that the theories rest upon

2532
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,280
stephen

2533
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,600
you know i think this also might point

2534
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,119
to your um cybernetics point daniel um

2535
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,000
in the sense of you know where

2536
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,560
does something happen at this kind of

2537
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,239
ergodic

2538
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:39,600
um

2539
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,239
process of mixing and where may it

2540
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,400
happen through a

2541
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,840
higher level

2542
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,000
cybernetic mechanism that the organism

2543
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,520
has

2544
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,960
that is enabled by

2545
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,840
sort of

2546
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,560
ergodic

2547
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,520
active inference or whatever processes

2548
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,320
are

2549
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,679
emerging

2550
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,080
but the fact that it's emerged from

2551
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,560
ergodic processes at multiple nested

2552
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,159
levels doesn't necessarily mean that

2553
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,800
some of the higher level ways of keeping

2554
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,520
something within bounds

2555
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,040
then has to

2556
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,639
follow that

2557
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,880
because it it you know you can create a

2558
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,400
system

2559
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,119
out of all the cells that are doing

2560
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:25,520
their thing so to speak

2561
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,119
or being their thing so that we

2562
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:31,360
we this is where it can maybe

2563
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,280
um

2564
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,600
be that danger that yeah there's an over

2565
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,440
extension of a certain process it's like

2566
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,800
okay where does

2567
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,280
something which is relying on

2568
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,080
ergodic processes

2569
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,960
or

2570
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,080
some other

2571
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,600
approaches

2572
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,560
able to give way to

2573
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,000
another type of um

2574
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,800
control theory

2575
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,080
yes and over short time horizons

2576
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,159
is it possible to have sensory motor

2577
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:03,760
loops that work

2578
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,239
whether or not some infinite case

2579
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,599
is what it rests upon blue

2580
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,040
so patricia i'm curious um to know or to

2581
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,960
know what you think about if you've read

2582
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,800
the decosta paper about um basinary

2583
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,800
basinary processes for

2584
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,639
bayesian process bayesian mechanics for

2585
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,199
stationary processes there you go um

2586
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,719
so i'm curious to know if you've read

2587
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,480
that and what you felt was perhaps

2588
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,520
lacking

2589
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,360
from that

2590
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
mathematical description

2591
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,199
to um meet the requirements that uh you

2592
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:40,880
were referring to for

2593
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,239
mixing systems and

2594
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,000
ergodicity yeah thank you i i did look

2595
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,560
at that but we explicitly wanted to

2596
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,400
focus on other assumptions not on the

2597
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,560
bayesian assumptions of the paper we

2598
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,199
didn't also mention the markov blanket

2599
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,119
assumption which is a core assumption in

2600
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:02,719
the free energy principle

2601
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,360
and we left that out deliberately first

2602
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,880
of all because of lack of space the

2603
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,040
paper is long enough second because

2604
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,800
there is much more literature on that

2605
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,000
than on the other these other

2606
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,719
assumptions that we discuss in our paper

2607
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,280
so i think in this formulation of um

2608
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,360
well i don't i don't have that paper on

2609
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,520
the top of my head but i think they they

2610
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,280
again uh

2611
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,560
rely on weekly mixing dynamical systems

2612
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,800
in the paper right

2613
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,719
they don't

2614
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:31,679
we can

2615
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:34,560
check they they use that framework

2616
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,400
so i think to the extent that they use

2617
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,239
that framework if i'm not mistaken then

2618
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,719
the same criticisms apply

2619
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,960
you need to find phase spaces and you

2620
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,800
need the existence of attractors at

2621
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,040
least

2622
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,760
cool

2623
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,320
i just imagine like these networks of

2624
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,520
citations like a

2625
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,159
some sort of biological metaphor some

2626
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,000
swarm of citations with words being

2627
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
traced between them and connections of

2628
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,800
the words and um

2629
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,760
i think um we're in the boutique the

2630
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,159
artisan the farmer's market phase of

2631
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:15,040
these kinds of analyses and there there

2632
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,360
will be a time not so far away

2633
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,480
when

2634
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,920
these questions can be resolved better

2635
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,239
blue

2636
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,159
um so yeah just like the paper aside i

2637
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:27,679
mean i i definitely realize that there

2638
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,840
are space constraints and also like what

2639
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,000
was the timing of your paper versus the

2640
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,760
decosta paper and

2641
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,360
did you have time to like incorporate

2642
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:39,199
all of those the new like updated um

2643
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:42,159
version of the maths uh so

2644
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:45,520
there's not weekly mixing or mixing

2645
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,280
mentioned in the de costa paper and so i

2646
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,360
really just would be curious maybe you

2647
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,199
want to follow up via email

2648
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:55,040
um to to know what what was missing

2649
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:58,239
from that that formulation in in your

2650
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,960
mind for it to be um plausible because

2651
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,280
for me too it was very uh

2652
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,920
like the the foundation of the fep

2653
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:09,679
existing in in ergodicity or requiring

2654
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,800
ergodicity for applicability was very um

2655
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,960
jarring like i felt like that's that

2656
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,639
can't be right

2657
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,880
but um i i felt that it was really

2658
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,440
resolved by the decosta paper and so i'm

2659
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,679
curious if you um

2660
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,840
don't feel the same way

2661
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,239
what your hesitation would be so maybe

2662
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,320
we want to follow up in in in a dot

2663
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,159
three at some point

2664
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,560
yeah or maybe or maybe by email so i

2665
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,280
would definitely look at this paper and

2666
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,719
other new research because that was

2667
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,639
published this year right

2668
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:43,440
it's very recent so the papers that we

2669
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,320
were

2670
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,239
focusing a little bit more on in the

2671
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,119
babe in our paper was par it is also

2672
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:52,480
very new and christian 2019 this prop

2673
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,719
this free energy principle for particle

2674
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,000
physics

2675
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,040
uh

2676
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,679
in the other papers we look at them uh

2677
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,159
very briefly because they were actually

2678
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,800
out after our paper was accepted or

2679
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,119
maybe during the review process so

2680
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,880
it wasn't part of our research

2681
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,960
systematic research but we did take a

2682
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,719
look at them

2683
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,280
uh i think we might have even quote that

2684
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,159
paper

2685
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,040
but yeah so i i would like to take a

2686
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,679
look at that again i'm not sure whether

2687
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,760
they use if they use the notion of

2688
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,520
information geometry then they probably

2689
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,480
also

2690
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,199
rely on weekly dynamical systems but

2691
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,920
i i would have to look at that again so

2692
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,679
we can continue the conversation by

2693
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:36,000
image

2694
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,159
counter factual paper spaces you know

2695
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,239
you have some sort of clause that gets

2696
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,600
triggered

2697
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,520
if something happens in the literature

2698
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,639
then

2699
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,119
this paragraph should be deleted like

2700
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,199
pending a future word on this this could

2701
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,639
be deleted

2702
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:53,920
um

2703
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,280
in the last

2704
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,560
little bit

2705
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,080
maybe we can just

2706
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,520
have any

2707
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,840
thoughts uh just

2708
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,960
why

2709
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,000
does this whole discussion matter for

2710
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
the fep and for active well the validity

2711
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,600
and the adequacy

2712
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,560
were how it was described by this paper

2713
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,679
why

2714
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:16,480
it

2715
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,119
it matters so it's kind of cool because

2716
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,080
often

2717
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,400
the citations that we discuss they don't

2718
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,760
always lay out on the table why it

2719
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,480
matters to understand this topic

2720
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,600
and uh i think we got that very

2721
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,119
clearly from this work so i really

2722
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:38,080
appreciated that and it also laid out

2723
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,639
many of the next steps directly not

2724
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,719
every next step but

2725
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,520
the specific key uh themes and

2726
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,719
challenges

2727
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,320
are addressed and if there is a obvious

2728
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,560
or non-obvious response

2729
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
that'll be a citation that somebody can

2730
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,400
swoop on stephen

2731
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,960
yeah i think it's important um because

2732
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,360
we are seeing a lot of

2733
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,119
interest

2734
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,800
a huge amount of interest from in

2735
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,520
activism and embodied work and

2736
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,000
physicality and how these things can

2737
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,360
shape up

2738
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,600
and therefore

2739
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,880
purely

2740
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,239
mathematical arguments

2741
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,520
will

2742
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,520
limit things i think getting into the

2743
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,000
nitty-gritty of the physics which in

2744
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,159
itself is

2745
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,679
wrestling with some of this because it's

2746
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,920
kind of cutting edge for them in terms

2747
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,679
of that is really important though i

2748
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,440
think because you see some of the

2749
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,280
criticisms coming

2750
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,119
around in activism

2751
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,199
um trying to get arrested on things and

2752
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,840
i do think i will say that i think

2753
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,639
maybe sometimes saying

2754
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,400
go and visit the math

2755
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,560
which is ultimately based on ergobicity

2756
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,639
which is basically a physics principle

2757
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,280
as much as a math principle in terms of

2758
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:00,080
you know how that comes to be present

2759
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,119
um

2760
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,600
comes up so i think this is this is a

2761
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,000
really important

2762
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,920
area that physics and

2763
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,600
and maybe the sort of the areas of

2764
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,920
applied physics start to come into

2765
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,880
yes

2766
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,239
and we'll just send them on the

2767
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,920
runaround okay go to the math and

2768
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,920
they'll go to the physics okay now

2769
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,320
to the philosophers you go and then

2770
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,639
back to another maybe non-academic

2771
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,080
department

2772
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,000
is that run around the answer what if

2773
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,239
there's a stationarity in the runaround

2774
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:37,760
but

2775
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,760
very good points um

2776
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,520
it's kind of fun because we've had these

2777
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,040
questions

2778
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,320
for a long time if not

2779
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,480
the longest time

2780
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,360
yet

2781
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,639
many of them

2782
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,600
were explicitly addressed by this paper

2783
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,360
and by the 31

2784
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,920
discussions

2785
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,400
so that's kind of cool to see like a

2786
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,360
sort of it's not a conclusion on our

2787
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,960
series but these

2788
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,960
these uh questions which are often the

2789
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,480
next step

2790
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,360
for other papers

2791
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,280
discussed in the dot 2 discussed in the

2792
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,119
conclusion or the discussion

2793
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:20,000
that's where this work

2794
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,199
picked up

2795
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:23,440
and so that that's a um

2796
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,119
a different attribute than we've seen

2797
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,560
from some of the other

2798
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:29,600
literature we discussed

2799
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,840
um

2800
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,600
blue

2801
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,040
dave do you have any other thoughts

2802
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,040
patricia would you like to give any

2803
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,840
final comments

2804
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,080
i think i have said enough

2805
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:48,000
unless you have an uh a last question

2806
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,719
what papers i i'm a little bit of fun

2807
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:51,920
i'm sorry i'm a little bit of an

2808
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,760
outsider in the free energy principle i

2809
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,560
must confess but um

2810
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,760
i i would like to see how it progressed

2811
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,239
so as i as i said at the beginning we

2812
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:03,440
are not

2813
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,760
against the the free energy principle a

2814
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,199
priori so if our paper can lead to more

2815
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,880
research in the free energy principle

2816
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,480
direction we would be happy and we would

2817
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,800
consider it a success so we are not

2818
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,880
necessarily enemies of the free energy

2819
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,040
principle and i'm in principle very

2820
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,800
interested in the application of

2821
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,719
statistical mechanics and even the

2822
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:25,040
language of dynamical systems to biology

2823
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,679
so i am in principle interested in this

2824
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,679
type of of research and also in the

2825
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,840
active inferences interdisciplinary

2826
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,800
research

2827
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,960
so i would be very interested in see how

2828
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,560
this evolved is and if we as

2829
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,719
philosophers can contribute to that by

2830
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:41,199
criticizing some points that we find

2831
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,679
non-rigorous enough then our job is done

2832
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:46,800
so that's basically our goal

2833
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,639
thanks patricia totally agree this um

2834
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:53,360
hopefully we can enact the kind of

2835
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,719
dialogue at the micro like a

2836
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,840
conversation and a disciplinary

2837
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,840
or scholarly dialogue that plays out

2838
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,199
over years

2839
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:02,480
and

2840
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,320
the philosophers have a very important

2841
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,320
role in that blue

2842
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,400
so what uh patricia was just saying

2843
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:13,040
reminds me of um you know when we

2844
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,880
discussed mike levin's paper in the

2845
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,400
summer um

2846
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,400
the computational boundary of a self

2847
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,199
it's

2848
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:20,719
it's you know there's the

2849
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:22,480
instrumentalist view

2850
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,400
and then the realist view

2851
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,440
and then the utility axis in that in

2852
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,239
that uh diagram and so definitely um i

2853
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,560
thought that this paper was useful in

2854
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,520
provoking dialogue and um

2855
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,520
really kind of uh

2856
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,000
i would like to leverage your vantage

2857
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,320
point to kind of grind into some of the

2858
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,239
deeper maybe more mathematical stuff

2859
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:45,679
that's kind of beyond me because it's

2860
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,920
not really my my background but to kind

2861
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,080
of you know dig into that hole and make

2862
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,159
sure that there's a solid foundation

2863
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:53,520
under the hole or is it a hole that

2864
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,199
pokes all the way through and leads to

2865
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:57,520
nothing on the other end so i think um

2866
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,520
you know it's useful for for getting at

2867
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,639
those those questions

2868
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,239
my last question patricia would be what

2869
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,480
areas of literature or papers might you

2870
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,400
recommend that we

2871
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,679
dive into

2872
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:15,119
so that we can have a comprehensive view

2873
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,400
and um

2874
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,840
know where we're coming from and where

2875
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,080
we're going

2876
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:20,880
uh

2877
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,440
i have i can mention many many babies so

2878
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,840
you can do that better by email again so

2879
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,440
if you're interested in literature and

2880
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,960
some specific

2881
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,199
uh

2882
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:34,239
research or topic just send me an email

2883
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,080
and i can recommend philosophically to

2884
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,520
you but i would like to especially

2885
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,639
recommend one paper so if i can choose

2886
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,600
and i don't know the title right

2887
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,280
hopefully but it's

2888
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,719
it's a paper by karim thibault uh

2889
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,159
who is called something about

2890
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,400
imperialism and migration so i can look

2891
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,600
at that now

2892
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,199
because it really

2893
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,840
it's a very general paper in philosophy

2894
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,040
of science

2895
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,960
where drastic

2896
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,280
they draw a very nice distinction

2897
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,760
between migration of models and

2898
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,239
imperialism of models that i think will

2899
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,239
be also useful in the interdisciplinary

2900
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:12,400
research that you are doing

2901
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,639
uh because they they stress the

2902
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,960
difference about using the methods for

2903
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,560
or exporting the methods from one

2904
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,320
discipline to the other

2905
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,599
uh

2906
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:24,719
in a non um imperialist way which would

2907
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,960
imply that in the new discipline you

2908
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,639
have to justify

2909
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,440
the model you have to justify the the

2910
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,239
the mathematical methods that's that's

2911
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:36,159
the one models on the move migration and

2912
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,920
parallelism brilliant

2913
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,440
and they distinguish between that that

2914
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,679
they call migration of models from

2915
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:44,560
imperial imperialism in which you just

2916
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,880
extrapolate the same models from one

2917
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,280
discipline to the other and you try to

2918
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,760
expand your discipline which would be

2919
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,880
sort of the

2920
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,880
the attitude that you were

2921
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,040
you were um

2922
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,560
that was illustrated in the in the

2923
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,880
comics that you were discussing last

2924
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,119
last week so i think that paper is

2925
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,440
especially useful for for for people

2926
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,280
doing interdisciplinary research because

2927
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,840
it's a very useful

2928
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:12,320
distinction this model is on the move

2929
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,480
thanks for the awesome suggestion so

2930
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,520
just to the point about

2931
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,920
emails or however it goes just consider

2932
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,119
the dialogue opened we really appreciate

2933
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,679
that both of you came to discuss and

2934
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,080
also interacted with the dot zero and

2935
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,639
dot one videos so just

2936
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,159
awesome work with uh research and thanks

2937
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,440
again for

2938
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,639
helping our

2939
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,719
lab do what it does

2940
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,920
and this is also an excellent suggestion

2941
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,239
because it's a provocative

2942
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:45,199
title

2943
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:47,199
but we're talking about

2944
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:48,800
provocative ideas

2945
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,639
and with broad

2946
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:53,040
scope and this kind of takes that map

2947
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,280
territory discussion

2948
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,800
to a new

2949
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,920
place

2950
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,000
potentially talking about

2951
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,360
movements

2952
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,320
and imperialism and

2953
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,199
colonization all these other things that

2954
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:09,360
come up in different terms but we've

2955
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,320
noted this in our upcoming streams

2956
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,760
calendar

2957
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,599
so after our lab meeting next week

2958
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,599
we'll have stochastic chaos and markov

2959
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:21,599
blankets so that will complement some of

2960
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,119
the things that we didn't talk about in

2961
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,119
31.

2962
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:27,760
we'll talk in 33 thinking like a state

2963
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,480
with aval aka serval

2964
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,960
and then we have two more slots open so

2965
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,560
perhaps we'll select one of these that

2966
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,159
we've already listed

2967
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,440
or perhaps

2968
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,760
somebody wants to join if an author

2969
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,520
wants to discuss

2970
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,360
and um

2971
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,719
other than that

2972
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,199
i think that brings us to a close today

2973
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,639
so again big appreciation to the authors

2974
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,320
for their work and engagement with the

2975
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,119
lab and thanks steven dave and blue and

2976
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:56,880
everyone else who participated in

2977
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,320
maxwell for joining the dot one so

2978
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,719
good times and we will see you next time

2979
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:09,320
thank you thank you very much bye
