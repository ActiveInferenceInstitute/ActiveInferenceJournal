00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,160
hello everyone welcome to the active

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
inference lab this is active inference

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
live stream number 31.0

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,119
it's october 14 2021.

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,520
welcome to the act imp lab we are a

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
at the links here on this slide

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,440
this is recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,200
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
feedback so that we can improve on our

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
work

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,559
welcome here and we'll be following good

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
video etiquette for live streams

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
at this short link you can see some of

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
the past present and future

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
streams that we'll be doing in the lab

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
as part of the dot com's organizational

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
unit and the first tab has the regular

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
tuesday discussions that are group

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
discussions dot one and dot two

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
right now we're in a dot zero kind of an

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559
ad hoc scheduled contextualizing live

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,680
stream

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
and then the other tabs have other kinds

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
of live streams that can be scheduled at

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,200
different times different topics so just

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
let us know if you want to get involved

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
or co-organize an event with us

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
today in active stream number 31.0

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,280
the goal is to learn and discuss

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
this paper non-equilibrium

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
thermodynamics and the free energy

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
principle in biology by patricia

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,400
palacios and matteo colombo

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
like all the dot zeros you'll get the

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,079
disclaimer that this is just an

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,400
introduction to some of the ideas of the

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
paper and the context it's not a review

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
or a judgment or a final word

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
in

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,479
31.0 we're going to start by looking

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,040
over some of the key aims and claims and

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
the abstract and the roadmap of the

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,720
paper to get the big picture

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
then talk about some of the keywords

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
maybe you're really familiar with some

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
of the keywords maybe it's the first

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,119
time you've thought about some of these

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
topics and then we'll walk through some

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
of the figures and formalisms and just

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
get set up in the coming weeks to be

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
discussing this paper

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,840
so we'll start with just some

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
introductions and warm-ups we'll say

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
hello and then maybe just mention

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
something that we're excited to

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
talk about or learn about or something

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
that we noticed while reading the paper

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
california and this is just an exciting

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
paper and topic because it's at the

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
intersection of chemistry and physics

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
and thermodynamics but also active

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
inference and it's a nice

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,440
starting point for a conversation about

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
what are the precursors and the tenants

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
and the principles of free energy

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,760
principle and active inference and then

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
what are the consequences and what does

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,239
that mean for the big picture blue

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,000
i'm blue knight i'm an independent

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
research consultant in new mexico uh and

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
i really was excited to see this paper

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
bring up some of the points that i've

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
brought up as i've been reading more

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
about active inference

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
specifically with uh respect to

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
ergodicity and

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
what that means the potential

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
implications for that

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
and also just other minor topics but

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
things i've mentioned in the past

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
it's cool sometimes to see how the

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
threads of our previous discussions and

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,959
things that

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
a participant might have brought up like

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
hey this isn't making sense and it's

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,799
like don't worry it's not just you these

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,840
are open

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
research questions and so we're seeing

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
that and we'll be enacting it in the

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
coming weeks

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
some of the big questions in the paper

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
kind of framed in

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,280
non-technical or in not the author's

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
words

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,560
it's really asking what fundamental

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
ideas from physics are utilized in the

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
free energy principle and how are they

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
utilized why are they utilized and then

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,720
what are some implications or trade-offs

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
associated with the use of these ideas

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
either the ways that they have been used

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,760
what are the pros and cons or what are

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
the implications and what about the ways

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
that they could be used

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
so in the spirit of

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,360
positive contributions to the literature

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
how are we taking ideas from physics and

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
other fields

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,680
bringing it together in free energy

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
principle and then what are the

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
fundamental or just spuriously

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,639
contemporary tradeoffs

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,479
let's first go to the aims and claims of

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,759
the authors

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,639
so

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
all read it and then blue you can give a

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
thought

124
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
well the paper is the non-equilibrium

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
thermodynamics and free energy principle

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
in biology on the fillsci archive at

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,440
pitt so check out the paper and read it

128
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,639
if you want to

129
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
and a few of their aims and claims that

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,479
we can extract out

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
the free energy principle has received a

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
lot of attention but its foundations in

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,479
statistical physics and dynamical

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
systems theory have not been probed yet

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
this lack of attention is unfortunate

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
because the theoretical adequacy of the

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,000
free energy principle as well as its

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
practical utility for the study of key

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
biological properties such as

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
homeostasis and robustness depend on the

141
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
validity of those foundations

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
here we begin to fill this gap

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
so that's kind of one of their

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,680
contextualizing claims

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
and their aim

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
and one of their

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,840
arguments

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
a claim about their arguments is that as

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
we are going to argue the foundations

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
and physics concepts allow models built

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
from the free energy principle to

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,280
achieve maximum generality but these

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
assumptions also decrease the ability of

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
these models to include enough factors

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
to provide biologically plausible

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,680
representations of the causal networks

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,759
responsible for living systems dynamic

158
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,759
equilibrium

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
any thoughts on the aims or we can

160
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
continue

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,919
wait i can't hear you

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,520
i think that the aims are good sorry i

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
just realized i was muted um i think

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
that the these are good aims i think

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
that uh one of the fundamental

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
um

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
claims is that in order to make the fep

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
more general generalizable it's not

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,400
as specific to biology as it could be i

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,319
think that that was like the key

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
trade-off maybe

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,440
yes between specificity and utility and

173
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
generalizability so

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
one mindset is that as we generalize

175
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
we're going to be explaining more

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
systems different systems explaining

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,319
them better doing more and it's just all

178
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
up up with generalization

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
another contrasting opinion is that as

180
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
we generalize we out of necessity

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,479
abstract or average out over particulars

182
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,440
and so we might actually lose utility or

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
potentially

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
and even disastrously

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
lose the specifics of the system that

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
we're talking about so all of a sudden

187
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,759
we have this free floating

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
generalization or abstraction that maybe

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
initially was inspired by wanting to

190
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
explain some sort of key biological

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
property

192
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
like homeostasis and robustness in the

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,880
author's view but then we end up sort of

194
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
um

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
throwing out

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
the kernel or the essence of what we

197
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,000
wanted to explain because we generalized

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
too much so

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
we'll be exploring that

200
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
okay do you want to read the abstract

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,120
sure

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
according to the free energy principle

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
life is an inevitable and immersion

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
property of any ergotic random dynamical

205
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
system at non-equilibrium steady state

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
that possesses a markov blanket first in

207
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,800
2013.

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,639
formulating a principle for the life

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
sciences in terms of concepts from

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
statistical physics such as random

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,319
dynamical system

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
non-equilibrium steady state and

213
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
ergodicity places substantial

214
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
constraints on the theoretical and

215
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
empirical study of biological systems

216
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,039
thus far however the physics foundations

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
of the free energy principle have

218
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
received hardly any attention here we

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
start to fill this gap and analyze some

220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
of the challenges raised by applications

221
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
of statistical physics from modeling

222
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
biological targets

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
based on our analysis we conclude that

224
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
model building grounded in the free

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
energy principle exacerbates a trade-off

226
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
between generality and realism because

227
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
of a fundamental mismatch between its

228
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,840
physics assumptions and the properties

229
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,680
of actual biological targets

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,479
cool

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
and

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
there's a lot to say that's just the

233
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
opening

234
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
salvo from the authors

235
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,320
how do they make good on this abstract

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,958
we can look at the roadmap

237
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,640
there's not too many sections in this

238
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
paper but there's a lot of uh meat

239
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,800
within

240
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
there's a general introduction and then

241
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
a specific introduction to the free

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
energy principle which is described in

243
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
the context of self-organizing

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
dissipative systems

245
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
and then there's a little discussion on

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
the explanatory scope of the fep

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
and the introduction of the winged

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
snowflake

249
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
thought experiment or idea which we'll

250
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
return to soon

251
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
section 3 talks about biological systems

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
as random dynamical systems which isn't

253
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
something that fep invented it's not

254
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
something that active invented this is a

255
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
broader question about how to model

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,640
biological systems and dynamical systems

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,560
section 4 models biological active

258
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
states as random dynamical attractors

259
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
and talks about three big physics ideas

260
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
that if we take section three you know

261
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
if we want to be modeling biological

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
systems as dynamical systems then

263
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
we're using this physics ontology and

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
what other key terms are relevant in

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
physics for discussing random dynamical

266
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
systems and we will go through them

267
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
they are the idea of phase spaces in

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
biology

269
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,279
ergodicity

270
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
and random dynamical attractors there's

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
then a discussion and a short conclusion

272
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
so that's kind of the overall

273
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
roadmap that's where we're going to go

274
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,000
we're going to be exploring that

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
trade-off or the implications

276
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
of the introduction of

277
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
physics fundamentals

278
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,720
into the generalization of biological

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
systems and maybe even non-living

280
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
systems as well and just

281
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,399
how's it all going to come together and

282
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,160
how does it influence how we research

283
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
going forward

284
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
the key words

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
are

286
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
fep free energy principle

287
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
dynamic equilibrium

288
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
homeostasis

289
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,519
phase base

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
ergodicity and attractor

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
and we can ask where's active inference

292
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
not that it has to be a keyword for

293
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
everything but

294
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
as we

295
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
discuss let's keep in mind what are the

296
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
differences between fep

297
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
and active and what are the implications

298
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,279
of

299
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,600
these claims about fep for active

300
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
all right how about the first keyword

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
dynamic equilibrium

302
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
so interestingly like you um said that

303
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
you like how this paper brings together

304
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
physics and chemistry and biology and i

305
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
thought that chemistry was kind of

306
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
blatantly omitted

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
and in my heart i'm a chemist like if i

308
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
hadn't studied neuro i would have really

309
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
like gone into ocum i just thought that

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
like working in the lab was a little

311
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
scary like too much ether and two like

312
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
whoa when i came out um

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,360
so so really uh when i look up dynamic

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
equilibrium or the context that i'm

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,079
familiar with dynamic equilibrium is in

316
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
chemistry and so a dynamic

317
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
equilibrium occurs when you have a

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
reversible chemical reaction so it's not

319
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
that the

320
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
reaction is over right like here's an

321
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
example of water um ionizing into

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
hydroxide and um protons right

323
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,399
and so

324
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,240
you you it's not that when you have the

325
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
equilibrium that the reaction is still

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,079
occurring it's just occurring at equal

327
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
rates in the forward and reverse

328
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,519
directions

329
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
so this is dynamic equilibrium and it

330
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
only happens in a reversible chemical

331
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
reaction like so so there's no other way

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
that i know of that dynamic equilibrium

333
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
um happens it is an example of a system

334
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
particularly a chemical system at a

335
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
steady state and so i looked through the

336
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
paper i don't know if you want to flip

337
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,839
to the next slide

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
um i looked to the paper and i i looked

339
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
like well how are the authors using

340
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,639
dynamic equilibrium

341
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,360
and i found this um phrase which i'll

342
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
say here the core of this account is a

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
free energy principle

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
um according to which all biological

345
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,680
systems actively maintain a dynamic

346
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
equilibrium with their environment by

347
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,760
minimizing their free energy which

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
enables them to avoid a rapid decay into

349
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
an inert state of thermodynamic

350
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
equilibrium and so then there's some

351
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
citations first in and the ramstead 2018

352
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
paper and par and first in in 2019 and

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
so even i looked back through these

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
papers and looked for dynamic

355
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
equilibrium and it's not there

356
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
in the references that i was able to

357
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
find and so i was curious what the

358
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
authors meant

359
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
by dynamic equilibrium in a living

360
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
system i mean as far as i know um like

361
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,519
maybe they meant dynamic coupling

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
between the organism organism and the

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
niche

364
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,279
or maybe they mean the non-equilibrium

365
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,320
steady state of homeostasis which is not

366
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,839
a dynamic equilibrium it's it's a

367
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
non-equilibrium so i just found this

368
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,079
this phrasing kind of curious um

369
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,240
and i'm assuming just based on context

370
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,760
that they're referring to homeostasis

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
but homeostasis includes plenty of

372
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
irreversible reactions irreversible

373
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,600
chemical reactions and so that's kind of

374
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
why this was a little bit

375
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
it makes sense like if we think about

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
instead of the water ionizing and the h

377
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,399
plus and the oh minus coming back

378
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,639
together and the overall values on both

379
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
sides are staying the same so let's

380
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
think in the biological case like moment

381
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
to moment our our mass is staying the

382
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
same let's just say or some people might

383
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
maintain the same mass for 30 years

384
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,279
but

385
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
underlying that stability is actually

386
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
many many

387
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
you know synthesis of fatty acids and

388
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
the breakdown of fatty acids and so it's

389
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
like okay i get it that they're both

390
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
going both sides at the same rate so

391
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
there's a stable point

392
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
but then also it's constituting its own

393
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
irreversible thermodynamic

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
reactions sometimes and so it's a good

395
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,760
question

396
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,959
do

397
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
fristen at all use the term dynamic

398
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,480
equilibrium

399
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
and are we talking about dynamic

400
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,600
couplings which might be at steady

401
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,399
states or are we talking about the

402
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,720
non-equilibrium steady state of

403
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
homeostasis

404
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,240
okay

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
brings us to homeostasis

406
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,160
sure so homeostasis is the steady state

407
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
of

408
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,600
internal internal physical and chemical

409
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
conditions that are maintained by living

410
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
systems and there's a lot of variables

411
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
that are can be included in here uh mass

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
i think actually changes at night like

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,399
the the carbon that you exhale like you

414
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
actually weigh less in the morning from

415
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,160
like sleeping on my face and like

416
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
emitting carbon i heard um i don't know

417
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
if that's really true but i guess it

418
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
depends on what scale you're measuring

419
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
um but but i think that ph has to be the

420
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
same or within like a pretty defined

421
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
range um osmolarity sodium potassium and

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,079
calcium ions blood sugar

423
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,320
body temperature is a huge one

424
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
so and and we act we do things

425
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
throughout the day like eat and drink

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
and use the restroom and put on jackets

427
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,959
to maintain to help with our you know

428
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,639
homeostatic conditions um internally

429
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
well unless we're eating at night we're

430
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
losing water and some other molecules so

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
definitely we're lighter in the morning

432
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,199
and then one discussion that we've had

433
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
in a few different

434
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
streams is

435
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
when do we think of homeostasis as

436
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
reducing uncertainty from a set point

437
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,519
like sort of a desired temperature and

438
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
then we want to just reduce our

439
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
discrepancy versus when do we see

440
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
allostasis or almost like anticipatory

441
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,120
processes by which biological systems

442
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
actually

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
take excursions

444
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
qualified excursions from set points and

445
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
how do we think about that within the

446
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
broader history of cybernetics and it's

447
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,199
been said that um

448
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
cybernetics had some challenges with

449
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,680
dealing with post-homeostasis so it's

450
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,279
easy enough to see how a cybernetic

451
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
system seeks

452
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
a set point but then once you start

453
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
thinking what is the process by which

454
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,160
that set point is itself moved around

455
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,839
all of a sudden that challenged a lot of

456
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
historical cybernetics frameworks so

457
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
that's definitely what we're exploring

458
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
with active

459
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
let's take another dip into a physics or

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
a mathematical idea of a face base

461
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,320
so

462
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
i'll read the yellow parts or you want

463
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
to go for it

464
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
i'll read the yellow parts and then

465
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
you'd give any description so in a phase

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
space every degree of freedom or

467
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
parameter of the system is represented

468
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
as an axis of a multi-dimensional space

469
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
so like every point on this spiral has

470
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
two variables that describe it it's like

471
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,359
its value on the x and value on the y

472
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,400
and then

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
the phase space trajectory represents

474
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
the set of states compatible with

475
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,000
starting from one particular initial

476
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
condition located in the full phase

477
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
space that represents the set of states

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
compatible with starting from any

479
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
initial condition

480
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,799
so just a quick comment or a thought on

481
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
that so even just in the maintenance of

482
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
homeostasis like where your you know

483
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
osmolarity is the same and your blood

484
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
glucose is the same or just

485
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
intracellular glucose or atp levels or

486
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
you know if you just want to look at at

487
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
just maintaining homeostasis not even

488
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
including like

489
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
the potential possible actions that i

490
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
could take in like moving in a

491
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
three-dimensional environment or

492
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
anything like that but but it it becomes

493
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
very quickly an expansive

494
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,679
multi-dimensional space like something

495
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,280
that we're not even like here we have

496
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,400
like a 3d ish visualization but you know

497
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,720
in all these dimensions it becomes very

498
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
um very quickly computationally

499
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
intractable because of the

500
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
dimensionality that of options that

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,919
we're presented with and just even to

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,559
maintain a homeostatic set point is is

503
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,400
intense

504
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
yes

505
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
base spaces are just kind of the

506
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,880
descriptive it's literally just the

507
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
space that something can happen in

508
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,000
and then there are trajectories through

509
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,520
face space well there's points which

510
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,400
just are static values like three comma

511
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
four and then there are trajectories

512
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
which are like linkages amongst sets of

513
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,760
points

514
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
and then also

515
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
out there in phase space are attractors

516
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
so in the field of dynamical systems

517
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
in a tractor is a set of states in the

518
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
phase space

519
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
towards which a system tends to evolve

520
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,360
for a wide variety of starting

521
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
conditions of the system

522
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
system values that close enough to the

523
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,919
attractor values remain close even if

524
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,559
slightly disturbed so a kind of mental

525
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,000
model there is like

526
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,400
a rubber sheet and someone pulls the

527
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
middle down a little bit that is now an

528
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,240
attractor because things are from near

529
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
or far are attracted towards it and then

530
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
if they're at the bottom of that well

531
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
they're going to resist being moved away

532
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,080
from it

533
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,640
and so that's sort of a simple ball

534
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
rolling into a bowl attractor state and

535
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
there's simple equations that govern

536
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
that type of movement but in higher

537
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
dimensional

538
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
phase spaces there are

539
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
different

540
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,039
geometries of attractors

541
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,679
and then also for biological systems

542
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,640
it

543
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
is a challenge to model using attractors

544
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
but that's what this paper is really

545
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
about can we use that model of an

546
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
attractor to talk about biological

547
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
systems and how they regulate

548
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
okay so yeah and i i just pulled this

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
image out actually i think it was

550
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
brought up in the t in the paper and i

551
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
don't remember if the original author

552
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
who outlined these four types of

553
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
attractor if that was kaufman i think i

554
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
feel like it was kaufman but it was

555
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
cited in this paper as well about the

556
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
four different kinds of attractors and

557
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
so that's what's shown here is the

558
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,039
strange attractor the point detractor

559
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,480
the cycle and the taurus um so just in

560
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
case you were wondering what those kind

561
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,400
of attractors looks like it's it's a

562
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,400
drawn to points in this kind of way

563
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
it is also on

564
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,480
another phase space of attractors

565
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
with its own x and y axis

566
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,679
okay

567
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,200
ergodicity

568
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
so this is a quote from the paper then

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
blue any thoughts would be cool

570
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,200
the ergotic density is an invariant

571
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
probability measure that can be

572
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
interpreted as the probability of

573
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,200
finding the target system m in any state

574
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
x when observed at a random point in

575
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
time first in 2012.

576
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
the assumption of ergodicity is

577
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
important to get the fep off the ground

578
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
since it ensures that organisms can be

579
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
modeled as having invariant

580
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,039
characteristics over time

581
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,280
so just to kind of relate ergodicity to

582
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
the phase space

583
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,159
so the concept of ergodicity is in a

584
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
potential phase space

585
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,120
that all of the potential points in that

586
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
space are visited at one point or

587
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
another like that is ergonomicity and

588
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,200
then the probability that you can find a

589
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,799
uh

590
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,200
the system in that space or it at that

591
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
point in space corresponds to how much

592
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
time the system spends at that point in

593
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,360
that space if that makes sense it's kind

594
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
of a circular loop but

595
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
this is just one slide we're gonna

596
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
return to ergodicity later on but this

597
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,039
is um

598
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
a topic that blue and i like learning

599
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,159
about however if you know more about

600
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
this it would be great to have your

601
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
perspective as well as if you're also

602
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,440
just learning it and have questions to

603
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
bring because

604
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
there's a lot you could learn about

605
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,400
ergodicity and the ergotic hierarchy so

606
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
take a dive and then let us know how the

607
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,320
water is

608
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
also getting fep off the ground i'm

609
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,080
thinking does fep start on the ground

610
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
does it start underground does it start

611
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,640
is it a snowflake with wings

612
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,400
has it always been that way

613
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
so

614
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
right exactly it's like the water cycle

615
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,520
okay so

616
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,400
on to the fep which is of course the

617
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,159
target the system of interest of this

618
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
paper and in active livestream 14 and

619
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
before then after then we've had a lot

620
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
of discussions what is the fvp how does

621
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
it relate to active inference and

622
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
it seems like we'll be working on those

623
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
questions for a long long time but a few

624
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
pieces that we've pulled out as kind of

625
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,360
being good

626
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,799
um sort of

627
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,760
cues

628
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
to bring up alongside free energy

629
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
principle and just see them as like

630
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,840
cousins or in a network together

631
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,159
multi-scale systems

632
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,159
ensembles like the collective behavior

633
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,360
of multiple particles or other

634
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,679
system subunits

635
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,760
the nexus of information and

636
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,919
thermodynamics which is really like

637
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,360
information

638
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,600
thermo like heat and dynamics dynamical

639
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
systems often thermo and dynamics aren't

640
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,520
really separated but we're getting at

641
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
that delineation

642
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
and then

643
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
action policy selection as variational

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,640
bayesian inference so using information

645
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,039
dynamics to study how policies are

646
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,240
selected

647
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
and then

648
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
they're sort of fep as it is today and

649
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880
then there's where could we go and

650
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
develop with this framework which is

651
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,039
what we'll be exploring today

652
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
any general comments before we get into

653
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
the paper

654
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
uh only that you know you we haven't

655
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,279
thermodynamics has classically been one

656
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
word so like i'm starting to just use

657
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
info dynamics as one word just to be

658
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
like non-discriminatory you know or just

659
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
dynamics it's like it's all information

660
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,799
it's all thermo so yes exactly

661
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
okay here we go to the paper

662
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
this is the first paragraph of the paper

663
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,279
and it's very informative

664
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
life scientists use the term equilibrium

665
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
in various ways and so we're going to

666
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
look at three different definitions of

667
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
equilibrium

668
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
and this is one reason why it's

669
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
important to have ontologies and have

670
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
ways of using terms that we can if not

671
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
distinguish at least be clear about in

672
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,520
their use so

673
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
sometimes life scientists

674
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
use equilibrium to refer to an inner

675
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
state of death where the flow of matter

676
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
and energy through a biological system

677
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,159
stops and the system reaches a life less

678
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
state of thermodynamic equilibrium

679
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,279
that's sort of the ultimate equilibrium

680
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,880
then there's

681
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
more often they use it to mean

682
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
homeostasis which is the ability of

683
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,159
keeping some variable in a system

684
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,240
constant or within a specific range of

685
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,279
values

686
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,360
going back to these old citations for

687
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
where the term actually arises from

688
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
and so that's sort of a living system so

689
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
there's parts of it that are consuming

690
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
energy hence not at the ultimate

691
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
equilibrium but there's also other

692
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,320
elements of it at least over certain

693
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,000
time scales that are invariant

694
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
some other time

695
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
the term equilibrium is associated with

696
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,039
the concept of robustness which refers

697
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
to the capacity of systems to

698
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,159
dynamically preserve their

699
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
characteristic structural and functional

700
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,320
stability amid perturbations due to

701
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
environmental change internal noise or

702
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,360
genetic variation so it's sort of like a

703
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,000
low bar a medium bar and a high bar of

704
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,039
equilibrium ranging from just yeah the

705
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,679
molecules are not doing any motion

706
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,799
and there's a carcass on the ground two

707
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
the molecules are churning

708
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
and there's something invariant about

709
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
the living system

710
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
going up into even the idea of

711
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
robustness which is that the system is

712
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
doing something to maintain

713
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
its sort of equilibrium like its balance

714
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
amidst noise which is

715
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,440
maybe seen as a type of homeostasis but

716
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,240
not exactly the same so any thoughts on

717
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,120
why um these distinctions are matter are

718
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
mattering or why start the paper this

719
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,000
way

720
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
you know i'm curious daniel like i i

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,559
mean we've been in the life sciences for

722
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,640
20 some years more maybe um and i've

723
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
only used equilibrium in terms of life

724
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
sciences in the first way to like as

725
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
death um so i'm just curious and perhaps

726
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
this is the the inner chemist in me but

727
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,039
but are you familiar with all of these

728
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,559
uses of equilibrium and the life

729
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,120
scientists in the life sciences also

730
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
i think i've

731
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
seen the second one people might not

732
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
call it equilibrium but like a buffer

733
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
equilibrium well the carbonate and the

734
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,799
co2 in your blood and it's maintaining a

735
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,240
buffered a ph equilibrium

736
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
so that's not death it's a living system

737
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,960
that's doing it but it's referring to

738
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
some chemical process that's being kept

739
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
at a dynamic equilibrium

740
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
within the scaffold that a living

741
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
biological system is providing

742
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,360
and um

743
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,799
i'd also be curious i don't think we

744
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
dove into it this kitano 2004

745
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,880
like

746
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,799
homeostasis to keep something within a

747
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
range of values it sounds a lot like

748
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,960
robustness so how are the how are the

749
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
second and the third definitions

750
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
different because like anti-fragility is

751
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
something different where perturbations

752
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
actually strengthen the system or cause

753
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
it to develop for example but robustness

754
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,039
is a little bit more like homeostasis

755
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,399
but

756
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,360
open to anyone's thoughts we'll see

757
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,320
now

758
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,360
on to

759
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
fristen at all

760
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,919
so

761
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,320
over the past 20 years is giving us some

762
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,880
historical context

763
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
since the new millennium

764
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,120
theoretical neuroscientist carl fristen

765
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
and collaborators have developed an

766
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
account of the conditions of possibility

767
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,080
of a certain kind of dynamic equilibrium

768
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,399
between a biological system and its

769
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,520
environment

770
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
the core of this account is a free

771
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,679
energy principle according to which all

772
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
biological systems actively maintain a

773
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
dynamic equilibrium with their

774
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,679
environment by minimizing their free

775
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,960
energy

776
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480
through inference in action

777
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
which enables them to avoid a rapid

778
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
decay into an inert state of

779
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
thermodynamic equilibrium

780
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
so here's a few of the citations 2012 13

781
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
rams said at all 2018

782
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,799
par and first in 2019 so here are the

783
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,840
papes

784
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,760
if people want to dive into the

785
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,520
references those are always really good

786
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
places to start

787
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
but whether you take the authors at

788
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,919
their uh manifold dimensionally reduced

789
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,559
word or you go into these original

790
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,559
papers or you know you send a tweet to

791
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,880
an author or you come in a live stream

792
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,159
and talk to them

793
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,039
what are the key claims of the fep

794
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,799
from a rhetoric perspective what does

795
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,640
the fep assume and what does it claim

796
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
which papers

797
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,320
are key to fep

798
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,679
not what was important in 2005 from 2002

799
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,159
but today what is important so how do we

800
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,240
respect that different citations from

801
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,360
the past

802
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,520
might have a partial picture or use a

803
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
different formalism

804
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,080
and then which papers are contradictory

805
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
even if only temporary so somebody might

806
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,880
make a claim in a 2010 paper you can't

807
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
explain situation x and then like you

808
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
know two weeks later first in it all

809
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
write the response

810
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,840
and then

811
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
some people have uh they bought the

812
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,600
rumor but they haven't heard the news

813
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
so how do you

814
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
keep a coherent narrative of the

815
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
literature

816
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
as there are

817
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
errors contradictions disc concordances

818
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,799
all kinds of things that just make it

819
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,200
less easy than it could be to understand

820
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
what is happening with fep its

821
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,559
proponents and its detractors

822
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,760
um so just a thought on this and

823
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
something that i was thinking about as i

824
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,279
was reading the paper and a lot of this

825
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,039
is footnoted throughout the paper but

826
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,159
the fbp like has evolved over the last

827
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,720
20 years so it didn't start off like in

828
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,799
the state that it is now it didn't start

829
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,919
off like a completely elaborated um

830
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,880
theory

831
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
and so it would be really cool to

832
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,640
develop a timeline of the fep like first

833
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,360
concept you know 2006 or whatever and

834
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,159
then

835
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,399
at what point in time did like the

836
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,480
markov blanket come into play and then

837
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
when did active inference separate from

838
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,880
the fep and and to kind of get like a

839
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,399
good idea of this situation as it's gone

840
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,679
through it's several iterations now

841
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,880
great idea blue i hope that in actin

842
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,600
flab and other groups we could

843
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
collaborate to really make that happen

844
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,799
because to have the timeline of

845
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,000
developments

846
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,559
and cross-link that with the core terms

847
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,640
which we'll talk about later today and

848
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,919
then also

849
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
just who was involved and what were the

850
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
contributions it would just make it

851
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,440
tremendously easier instead of just

852
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
going back to square one sort of a

853
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,039
scholar search just when we're curious

854
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,039
about hey has there been something

855
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
written about free energy and x

856
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,120
okay so that was sort of the neutral

857
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,720
context or

858
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
at least not so

859
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,760
barbarous

860
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,960
but

861
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,919
here's where the authors uh bring in the

862
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
the gap the free energy differential in

863
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,760
the literature and their contribution

864
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,360
what actions are they going to take to

865
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
reduce the differential

866
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,880
the free energy principle has received a

867
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,240
lot of attention

868
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,120
no citations from who a lot relative to

869
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
what

870
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
it's not i'm not saying it's incorrect

871
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
in the paper just it would be awesome to

872
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,360
learn

873
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
what does it look like to have a lot of

874
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
attention what does a google trends

875
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
or a book engram viewer search results

876
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,200
in

877
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,159
are we on the up or are we going down

878
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,919
from some period of time so what

879
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
attention what regime of attention has

880
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,559
the fep received and from whom

881
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,360
but

882
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
the foundations of fep in statistical

883
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
physics and dynamical systems theory

884
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,399
have not been probed yet

885
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,159
that's a claim maybe some people will

886
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,760
think that they have so we'll look

887
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
forward to learning about that

888
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,600
this lack of attention is unfortunate

889
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,240
because two reasons one the theoretical

890
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,320
adequacy of the fep

891
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
and two its practical utility for the

892
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
study of biological properties

893
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,559
depend on the validity of the

894
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,399
foundations so it's like we want the

895
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,880
house to be beautiful and useful

896
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,960
and if the foundations are not strong it

897
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,840
will not be beautiful and or useful

898
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,880
so this work of the paper as well as all

899
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
the work around it is related to that

900
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
gap

901
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,559
so a few big questions like what does it

902
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,440
mean for a principal fep

903
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
and

904
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,320
we can of course

905
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
have some subtlety with like what's a

906
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,840
principle a framework a theory a

907
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,919
hypothesis so let's just

908
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
kind of roll with it together what does

909
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,000
it mean for a scientific principle to

910
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,240
have foundations in

911
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,679
statistical physics what does it mean

912
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
for it to be grounded in dynamical

913
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
systems

914
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,279
why does that matter why does it matter

915
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,039
how it's grounded or who thinks it's

916
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
grounded in what

917
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,039
for the fep and in general

918
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,960
and then always trying to connect the

919
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,159
generalities with the minute particulars

920
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,039
what does this paper actually do

921
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,679
and then what work is still needed

922
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,360
because it's easy to get caught up in

923
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
some of these big sweeping

924
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
multi-decade

925
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,960
many person

926
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
research trajectories and it's helpful

927
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,279
sometimes to just separate out what is

928
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
the paper doing and then what is the

929
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,360
bigger picture like the grand synthesis

930
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,440
that has to be done between fep and some

931
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
other field

932
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,840
anything here

933
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,080
okay

934
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,159
here's from a footnote

935
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,760
and it's um

936
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,480
to forestall any confusion okay great

937
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
all my confusions are about to be

938
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
forestalled i love footnotes like that

939
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,600
our focus is on free energy theorists

940
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,159
not principalists by the way theorists

941
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,640
assumptions that all biological systems

942
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
at any scale can be modeled within the

943
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
framework of ergodic random dynamical

944
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
systems and that homeostasis and or

945
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
robustness can be defined and studied in

946
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,159
terms of dynamical attractors

947
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,320
so i don't know if that's a assumption

948
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,040
of

949
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
all fep

950
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,000
colleagues i don't know if it's a um

951
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
rather than an assumption but rather a

952
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,159
consequence like there are assumptions

953
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,599
that people use but then actually they

954
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,480
have come to this claim as a consequence

955
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,879
not as an assumption or an ungrounded

956
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,320
axiom

957
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,079
and while our discussion should suggest

958
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,918
that concepts and mathematical

959
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,760
representations from statistical physics

960
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,440
and dynamical systems theory are

961
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,599
sometimes abused in biology

962
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
it should not suggest that those

963
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,760
concepts and representations have no use

964
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,079
so it's saying in fact you can have good

965
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,159
explanatory predictive

966
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
models that involve dynamical systems so

967
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,119
it's not saying

968
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,760
math and biology is hopeless

969
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,359
and then also this 2004 paper i thought

970
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
who do you cite for saying that you know

971
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,480
math

972
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
gets abused in biology so this is robert

973
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,520
may a famous biologist

974
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,359
in 2004

975
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,560
and this was just very interesting like

976
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,320
understanding the non-linear dynamics

977
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
and this was in the case of a virus and

978
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
health situation

979
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
just extracting some of the key memes

980
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
it's like we're going to have to learn

981
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,960
across systems we're not just going to

982
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,079
be able to have one default system

983
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
we need to think about multi-scale

984
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
systems

985
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
for applying

986
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,640
and educating in transdisciplinary

987
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,119
contexts like

988
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,359
having a understanding of viral dynamics

989
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,040
is going to require population and

990
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
ecological understanding as well as

991
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
protein

992
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,359
and then

993
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,640
i venture to predict that the

994
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
corresponding immunology text will

995
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
indeed look different in 20 or even 10

996
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,079
years time okay well we're right between

997
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,680
10 and 20

998
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,240
and maybe immunologists are starting to

999
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,400
go oh yeah you can't just talk about

1000
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
what's in the

1001
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,200
what's the white blood cell touching the

1002
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,400
pathogen

1003
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,599
there's a bigger picture there's a

1004
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,720
society

1005
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,359
and then what are those abuses

1006
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
and they're not always easy to recognize

1007
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
especially because few

1008
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,440
have

1009
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,480
the

1010
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,720
expertise or the confidence or the

1011
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,800
personal narrative that they're able to

1012
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,960
ask questions across disciplinary

1013
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
contexts so it's easy sometimes for

1014
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
something to be transdisciplinary and

1015
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,560
then like the biologists don't question

1016
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,079
the physics and the physics don't

1017
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,240
question the biology and

1018
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,599
all of a sudden something is not really

1019
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,040
getting questioned so it's totally a

1020
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
great point

1021
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
and this is a really important kind of

1022
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
fallacy essentially where a mathematical

1023
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
model is constructed with an

1024
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
excruciating abundance of detail in some

1025
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
aspects while other facets of the

1026
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
problem are misty or vital parameters

1027
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,200
uncertain

1028
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,520
within a massive range

1029
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,040
and this happens just so many places

1030
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,280
it's unreal we made a mathematical model

1031
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,640
of this oh well you know of course we

1032
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,359
didn't consider other factor abc

1033
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,880
so it's not that everything has to be a

1034
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
theory of everything but

1035
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,359
we have to recognize that extremely

1036
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
partial mathematical models in

1037
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,800
biological systems

1038
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,359
may be less helpful than people claim

1039
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,280
them to be and it might be better if

1040
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
people pooled their efforts and worked

1041
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,720
towards better models

1042
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,520
any thoughts on that

1043
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,320
just uh you know i mean i think i'm

1044
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,960
definitely guilty of uh like i remember

1045
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
back to uh mike levin's live stream when

1046
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
when we were abusing physics

1047
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,400
um

1048
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
so guilty as charged sometimes

1049
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
um but but it's it is important to you

1050
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,680
know have an open dialogue and

1051
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,160
to ask questions like if there's a

1052
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,760
concept or something that you don't

1053
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
perhaps understand maybe like you feel

1054
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,680
like you're a beginner i mean i've

1055
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
definitely felt this way like maybe i'm

1056
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
just being dumb but

1057
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,880
you know and then there's actually a

1058
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,720
very valid question at the end of that

1059
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,680
sentence

1060
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,760
so if you don't understand something be

1061
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,240
sure to ask until you do i think yep

1062
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
imagine just all the times somebody has

1063
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,720
said oh fep does that apply to living

1064
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
systems and so yeah it's a done deal

1065
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
well you know it's not a done deal so

1066
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,079
the conversation is still happening

1067
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,920
here we get to section two introduce

1068
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
introducing the fep the free energy

1069
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
principle fep

1070
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,640
says that unless a biological system

1071
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
minimizes its surprise it will rapidly

1072
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,400
die

1073
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,359
now what do those citations say

1074
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,000
do they talk about system death or do

1075
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
they talk about system persistence

1076
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
more specifically fep presupposes a view

1077
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,119
of biological systems as essentially

1078
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,720
persisters

1079
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
different authors here

1080
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,880
and for foregrounds the conditions of

1081
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
possibility for the persistence of

1082
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,800
biological systems

1083
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,200
so that's their top-level take on fep

1084
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,640
and then to connect a few of the

1085
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,560
keywords in

1086
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,920
howie 2020 refers to a system's periodic

1087
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,560
phase attractive dynamics so attractors

1088
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,040
in the phase space that have periodicity

1089
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,440
in the state space to define what it is

1090
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,000
for a biological system to exist

1091
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
howie writes biological in existence is

1092
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,119
marked by a tendency to disperse

1093
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
throughout all possible states in state

1094
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,640
space

1095
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,480
e.g a system ceases to exist as it

1096
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,040
decomposes decays dissolves dissipates

1097
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,119
or alliteratively dies

1098
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,920
in contrast to exist is to revisit the

1099
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,720
same states or their close neighborhoods

1100
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,960
so this is kind of bringing together

1101
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,680
what is life schrodinger's question ram

1102
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
said it all 2018

1103
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,560
with

1104
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
dissipative systems and systems that

1105
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,880
resist dissipation systems that have a

1106
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
dynamic equilibrium what is the phase

1107
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,800
space we're talking about

1108
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
these are the big questions we're

1109
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,800
getting at

1110
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
and how does one disperse oneself

1111
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,880
exactly

1112
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,000
yes

1113
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
and how i

1114
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
think uh you heard that from somebody

1115
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,200
earlier today

1116
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,720
somebody was getting dispersed during a

1117
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,359
practice talk it happens

1118
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,240
and where's surprise come into play

1119
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,560
not just the psychological like wow i

1120
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,319
was surprised it was a surprise birthday

1121
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,440
party but how do we go from attractors

1122
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
and dynamical systems

1123
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,079
to

1124
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,560
this statistical bayesian concept of

1125
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,280
surprise and attracting sets and

1126
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
lower dimensional manifolds in

1127
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,640
attracting sets make that make that

1128
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,200
quote big one more time for me okay so

1129
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
something i i thought was um

1130
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,400
just unique or or maybe remarkable was

1131
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,720
it says free energy theorists relate the

1132
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,960
notion of entropy to the informatic

1133
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
information theoretic quantity of

1134
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,359
surprise but i think that this is done

1135
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,839
before the free energy principle arrives

1136
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,000
like so in information theory that's

1137
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
claude shannon makes the relationship

1138
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
between

1139
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
information and entropy and surprise so

1140
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
i don't think that that's a something

1141
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,079
that the fep started doing

1142
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,040
well

1143
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,520
two themes we'll return to today and

1144
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,760
again and again which is like

1145
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
first this shouldn't be a paid versus

1146
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
pape battle this isn't a battle royale

1147
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,240
for whose hot take will reign supreme we

1148
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,720
should be collaborating on bigger

1149
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,520
research agendas and so clarifying the

1150
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
contributions that different people have

1151
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
made will help demystify and make active

1152
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,839
inference and fep more accessible

1153
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,040
because

1154
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
which claims or which contributions were

1155
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,119
made like 100 years ago not that that

1156
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
makes it more valid but

1157
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,200
weren't made recently but sometimes when

1158
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,839
we only see recent citations it can be

1159
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,079
easy to get swept up but actually the

1160
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,599
authors of this paper do a good job of

1161
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
going back to some original citations

1162
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,440
but these are big eternal questions

1163
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,319
here's a fun paragraph in the paper

1164
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
um because it's sort of like uh i i

1165
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
reformatted it slightly because it it

1166
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,119
shows that we're in

1167
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,680
synchronous and asynchronous discussion

1168
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
with fristen at all

1169
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
so here is like you know him

1170
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,839
thinking slash saying first insane

1171
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,920
by finding this is fristen's claim

1172
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,760
pseudo first in claim not actually his

1173
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,560
quote

1174
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,240
by finding a suitable attractor in the

1175
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,079
dynamic model life scientists would be

1176
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,599
able to gain understandings of the

1177
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,680
workings of dot

1178
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,839
basically like this is the dream of

1179
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,240
active inference that if we had

1180
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,160
attractor phase base

1181
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,920
all these terms coming together

1182
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,599
then

1183
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,800
we could just

1184
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
make it work for diverse biological

1185
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,560
systems

1186
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,000
and then

1187
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,319
the authors of the paper write to better

1188
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,240
understand what this means

1189
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,319
let's examine how such idealized models

1190
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,839
are developed and why free energy

1191
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,119
theorists opt to build their model

1192
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,200
starting from concepts in physics

1193
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
so this is like the dream of active

1194
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,520
inference and physical groundings for

1195
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
biological systems

1196
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
and then the authors do the right thing

1197
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,400
which is to um to steal person the

1198
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,319
argument to investigate what its actual

1199
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,760
strengths are

1200
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,839
and why somebody would want to make that

1201
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,440
argument or why this is something that

1202
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
we're motivated to pursue instead of

1203
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,040
just immediately critiquing it as like

1204
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,319
not an important thing to want

1205
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,119
okay all right

1206
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,079
so

1207
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,440
here is

1208
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
in the red quote from the paper

1209
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,960
so first in at all 2006

1210
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
way long ago way way long ago asked us

1211
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
to

1212
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,440
ask us to imagine a snowflake endowed

1213
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,560
with wings

1214
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,640
this winged snowflake could move use its

1215
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
wings as solar reflectors or fans and

1216
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,720
exchange energy with the environment for

1217
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,480
a much longer period than we would

1218
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,160
expect of an inanimate piece of ice to

1219
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,560
keep going under identical circumstance

1220
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,800
unlike familiar snowflakes the winged

1221
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
snowflake can choose actions which are

1222
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,800
the means of by which different outcomes

1223
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,160
are brought about in different states

1224
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
the environment its wings allow the

1225
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,079
snowflake to bring about outcomes such

1226
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,440
as lowering its core temperature in

1227
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,960
response to an increase in air

1228
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,800
temperature so let's go to first in 2006

1229
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,560
and this is figure one

1230
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,319
so we're imagining they're sort of on

1231
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,880
the left is like a traditional snowflake

1232
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,240
model

1233
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,599
they're sort of it doesn't have any

1234
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,000
action affordances so it's just being

1235
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
tossed around in

1236
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,960
the soup and it freezes when it's cold

1237
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,720
and then when the temperature gets below

1238
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,599
this critical phase boundary it melts

1239
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,880
and the system

1240
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
fails to persist

1241
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,599
so it's like you know checkpoint are we

1242
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,680
good with systems persisting

1243
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
versus dissipating this is kind of our

1244
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,000
simple physical example a piece of ice

1245
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
freezing in the sky

1246
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,800
and melting

1247
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,280
all right now let's imagine if the ice

1248
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,560
froze

1249
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,680
in a way

1250
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,400
where it had wings

1251
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,200
and

1252
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
slightly different colored wings i

1253
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,119
wondered what the symbolism was here

1254
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,520
but it has these two different wings

1255
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,720
and that allows it to engage in action

1256
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,119
on the environment so for example if it

1257
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
detects or predicts or acts as if it's

1258
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
predicting that it's going to head

1259
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,119
towards a warmer area that's like you

1260
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,040
know lower down or something all of a

1261
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,760
sudden it can flap a few times and get

1262
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
into a colder area so here this

1263
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,000
snowflake just falls but this one is

1264
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,880
able to flap and stay cold

1265
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,119
and so through action

1266
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,839
it's able to persist longer

1267
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:26,800
so

1268
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,680
it's precluding a phase transition

1269
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,400
from solid to liquid

1270
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,520
through

1271
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,599
this active

1272
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,079
exchange with the environment so that's

1273
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
like the winged snowflake model

1274
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
that's kind of a nice thought experiment

1275
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,319
from yonder to help us understand like

1276
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,680
the steps from mere physical system

1277
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,760
to systems that start to engage in

1278
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,839
actions on the environment

1279
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,240
especially those that keep persistence

1280
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,359
of the system

1281
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,599
anything here

1282
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,040
okay

1283
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,280
here's figure 3 from that same fristen

1284
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
2006 paper

1285
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,160
and this is

1286
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
really an awesome figure

1287
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,640
because it shows some concordances

1288
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,200
between actinf even though it it's not

1289
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,960
even really used in those terms so

1290
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,720
that's why we need the timeline like is

1291
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,480
active even mentioned in this paper in

1292
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,920
2006

1293
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,599
it might not be actually

1294
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
but we can see there's this

1295
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,560
perception action cycle

1296
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
and this is related to a few other kinds

1297
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
of action perception cycles

1298
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,920
um footnote paper incoming

1299
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,000
we can think of this as like a bowl

1300
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,440
and then the ball is rolling to the

1301
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,680
bottom of the bowl it's a

1302
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,880
image we return to again and again now

1303
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,280
the y-axis is the free energy and so

1304
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,119
here's the minimum possible free energy

1305
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,640
and it's like the system starts here

1306
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,040
there's a change in the environment

1307
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,359
that causes a mismatch

1308
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,800
that mismatch

1309
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
can be reduced through two different

1310
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,240
types of updates of a model

1311
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,079
one is an action and the other is a

1312
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,960
perception so which order happens

1313
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
details details details but the idea is

1314
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
like at each loop there's an

1315
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,400
environmental change

1316
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359
which is then renormalized or returned

1317
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,280
to something

1318
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,880
through perception and action which

1319
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,720
relates to an act of inference

1320
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,800
how we say that the two ways that free

1321
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
energy can be minimized are through

1322
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,880
updates of the generative model like

1323
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,200
learning or parameter updating or

1324
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,960
through action how do we reduce supply

1325
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,000
surprise

1326
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,119
inference and action why reduce surprise

1327
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,800
because if we have an optimistic

1328
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,480
generative model we don't want to be

1329
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,200
surprised about our model where we're

1330
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,240
living so we act and we infer

1331
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,480
so that we persist

1332
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,280
any comments here

1333
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,960
but it's just a cool like input could be

1334
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,559
the state of chemoreceptors you know

1335
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
already we're going from these sort of

1336
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,359
physics formalisms and dynamical systems

1337
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,839
formalisms towards just oh yeah you know

1338
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,200
drop it it could be like chemical

1339
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,480
biological

1340
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,280
but

1341
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,160
was it justified in 2006 well looking

1342
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,440
back on it

1343
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,920
not as much as it is justified today

1344
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,559
and what will they say in 2033 looking

1345
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,319
back on this so

1346
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,520
all work in progress

1347
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,280
okay

1348
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,640
so this is from page six of the paper

1349
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,359
and

1350
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,280
won't uh

1351
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
read the full quote because we've kind

1352
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,040
of gotten at this trade-off between

1353
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,160
utility

1354
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,720
and accuracy and generalizability but

1355
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,880
the big questions here are

1356
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,000
what systems is the fep modeling or

1357
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,800
describing where has it been used where

1358
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,599
could it be used where shouldn't it be

1359
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,079
used or can't it be used

1360
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,200
how good is the fep for modeling or

1361
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,280
describing these different systems

1362
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,680
how good could it be and what would it

1363
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,200
take to get it there

1364
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,520
and then also an important question for

1365
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,680
for those of you who are fep or active

1366
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,200
fans and you have a challenging

1367
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,720
conversation

1368
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,839
take a step back and ask your colleague

1369
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,559
what models do you prefer with similar

1370
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,440
or different explanatory scope just what

1371
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,839
else is out there because

1372
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,079
it really helps ground the discussion in

1373
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,400
what that person's understanding or

1374
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,760
preferences are

1375
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,920
and a lot of times people will come up

1376
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,839
blank they'll say i'm critiquing your

1377
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
unified model of perception cognition

1378
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,400
action okay great critique away that's

1379
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,440
what i'm doing too what do you prefer up

1380
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,400
nothing so it helps us stay positive

1381
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
with the contributions that we're making

1382
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,079
to this field while also recognizing the

1383
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,359
discrepancy

1384
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,680
and that combination of recognizing

1385
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,400
discrepancy and taking action is active

1386
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,559
inference

1387
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,480
you know this is funny this is like a

1388
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,680
good contrast to the sims paper that we

1389
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,119
just did and i feel like at the end of

1390
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,240
the last live stream we were just

1391
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,000
talking about like thermodynamics and

1392
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
information theory and the relationship

1393
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,880
between those two things um but i always

1394
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,040
want to take the fvp and use it for like

1395
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,160
non-biological systems i think i like

1396
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,839
veer toward pan psychism more than most

1397
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:08,640
people

1398
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,800
and like i don't like that i have a hard

1399
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,480
time with the line between

1400
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,559
mirror active inference and adaptive

1401
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,000
active inference or like the

1402
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,079
evolutionary late evolutionary cover

1403
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,599
slate whatever

1404
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,920
uh like the you know brain is the

1405
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,599
ultimate um source of cognition and

1406
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,480
capable organ capable of cognition and

1407
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,000
so like would the fvp apply to a set of

1408
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,839
molecules in a beaker

1409
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,680
like it doesn't have preferences did

1410
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,000
molecules prefer to be in an equilibrium

1411
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
state or how does that work out like i

1412
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
want to take the fvp and use it

1413
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
in systems that maybe

1414
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,920
it's not designed for i don't know i

1415
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,400
tend to want to go the other way

1416
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,960
makes sense

1417
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,520
here's that adaptive versus mirror

1418
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,599
active inference slide from 30. good

1419
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,720
segue perfect segway and um so here's a

1420
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,920
question from

1421
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,240
fep landia

1422
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,800
what makes biological cognition special

1423
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,000
or different

1424
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,800
so

1425
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,040
we're not going to go too much into it

1426
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,599
here we talked about it in

1427
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,920
live stream number 30 a ton

1428
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,599
and it was just super interesting to

1429
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,119
what extent does it matter that it can

1430
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,200
engage in counter factuals does the

1431
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,359
temporal depth matter

1432
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,119
but if we're on the outside how do we

1433
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,440
know what the temporal depth is is it

1434
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,800
the temporal depth it acts as if

1435
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,119
it's cognizing

1436
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,200
where does energy dissipation come into

1437
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,000
play

1438
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,119
so these are big questions what is

1439
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,319
cognition

1440
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,800
and is there just one kind of cognition

1441
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,880
and biological systems do a special

1442
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,040
combination of it but it's different in

1443
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,880
kind of

1444
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,040
decimal point but not in the top level

1445
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,319
like are they or are they really

1446
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,079
different in type or is it such a great

1447
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,200
quantitative difference that it's

1448
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
different in type

1449
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,920
big

1450
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,559
questions here

1451
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,680
more from the paper

1452
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,720
active inference models are phase space

1453
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,680
representations of biological systems

1454
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,040
so that's like

1455
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,520
a full stop moment this isn't what

1456
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,079
biological systems are it's a phase

1457
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,359
space representation of systems here

1458
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,079
we're talking about biological systems

1459
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:20,960
as

1460
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,200
forming expectations over observable

1461
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,160
external states and inferring policies

1462
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,559
state action mappings that minimize the

1463
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,720
expected free energy of those states

1464
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
under a generative model in some

1465
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,680
predefined markov decision process

1466
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,920
by minimizing expected free energy the

1467
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,200
modeled system would attain a

1468
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,440
non-equilibrium steady state and so it

1469
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,880
would maintain

1470
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,599
in some sense a low entropy probability

1471
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,079
distribution over its states

1472
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,319
so what is active inference

1473
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,559
what topics is it related to

1474
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,960
what is it based upon

1475
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,280
we look at that ball in the bowl

1476
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,440
and it's easy to say well the way

1477
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,520
that the imperative that's pushing the

1478
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,200
system forward is that the ball wants to

1479
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,520
be as low down as possible and it's

1480
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,440
going to be minimizing its potential

1481
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,359
energy that way

1482
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,240
another story about the bowl is

1483
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,559
the ball is going to end up or act as if

1484
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
it's going to end up with the tightest

1485
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,160
bound

1486
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,040
through time on how far left and right

1487
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,200
it goes now that also takes you right to

1488
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,119
the bottom of the bowl but you didn't

1489
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,880
have to mention that you wanted to go

1490
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,680
down

1491
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,480
it was just that the desire to minimize

1492
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,400
the uncertainty

1493
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,119
led to the bottom of the bowl in that

1494
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,160
structure

1495
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,200
and so

1496
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,720
how do we think about some of these

1497
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,240
different ways and what are the physics

1498
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,440
metaphors

1499
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,480
and then

1500
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,079
an assumption from the paper an

1501
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,920
assumption made by the active inference

1502
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,839
models developed by free energy

1503
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:48,960
theorists

1504
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,800
is that target biological systems can be

1505
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,440
represented as random dynamical systems

1506
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,000
what does this assumption mean exactly

1507
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
what does it mean and what are the

1508
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
assumptions of active

1509
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,680
what are the assumptions of other

1510
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,880
frameworks

1511
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,119
does active have the same assumptions as

1512
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,520
other frameworks does it have fewer or

1513
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,480
different does it have more assumptions

1514
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
are there assumptions of active there

1515
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,720
are consequences of other ideas or vice

1516
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,680
versa

1517
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,760
so these are just awesome questions that

1518
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,280
the authors are raising and that their

1519
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,040
work is like a jumping off point into

1520
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,200
good

1521
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,359
good i so so one question that i always

1522
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,240
have is what if the so active inference

1523
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,400
and the free energy principle presumably

1524
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,079
have the same assumptions but but do

1525
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,359
they have to

1526
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,359
um and so that's always something i

1527
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,839
wonder

1528
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,359
how has active inference developed this

1529
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,200
is a fun paragraph

1530
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,280
active inference modeling evolves

1531
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,400
rapidly

1532
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,480
eats shoots leaves

1533
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,760
as maxwell ramstad dr maxwell ramsay

1534
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,319
helpfully reminded us in conversation

1535
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,480
up to roughly 2012 the dynamics of

1536
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,319
internal and active states inactive

1537
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,000
inference models were determined through

1538
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,160
gradient descent on variational free

1539
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,040
energy

1540
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,280
so let's call that phase one

1541
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,000
before 2012.

1542
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,319
we need a real timeline for this this is

1543
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,160
just informal but this is why we need

1544
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,760
the timeline

1545
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,119
figure out if we're truly on the best

1546
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,160
timeline

1547
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,559
from around 2012 until

1548
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,720
recently like 10 minutes ago or 2019

1549
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
active inference models have been

1550
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,760
equipped with algorithms for policy

1551
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,880
selection

1552
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
which evaluate the average free energy

1553
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,119
expected under each policy so expected

1554
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,880
free energy not just variational free

1555
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,400
energy

1556
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,079
in their latest work

1557
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,200
the active inference community

1558
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,559
have endowed their models with a

1559
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,480
recursive expected free energy

1560
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,400
functional which enables the models to

1561
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,160
represent target systems higher order

1562
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,000
counter factual beliefs

1563
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,480
which are beliefs a system has about the

1564
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,319
beliefs it would have as a consequence

1565
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,040
of action so that's the deep parametric

1566
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,280
active inference that's sophisticated

1567
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,040
active inference that's what we spoke

1568
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,599
about with a mental action paper sandved

1569
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,440
smith at all

1570
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,920
okay so those are three waves that are

1571
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,200
important to distinguish in the

1572
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,319
development of active inference models

1573
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,400
because these modeling advances all seem

1574
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,079
to make assumptions about the ergodicity

1575
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,920
of biological systems

1576
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,599
and the biological meaning of dynamical

1577
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,799
attractors

1578
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,280
the points we make in what follows may

1579
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,760
help explain why hashtag all active

1580
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,079
inference models thus far tend to trade

1581
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,119
off realism for maximal generality

1582
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,680
so they're respecting the developments

1583
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,280
on the framework

1584
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,359
and encompassing it summarizing it maybe

1585
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,000
accurately maybe not

1586
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,040
and then saying because they all make

1587
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,359
some common assumptions

1588
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,880
they're all victim to this trade-off of

1589
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,040
realism for generality

1590
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,280
or is it utility for generality which

1591
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,000
one was it again realism utility

1592
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
what are the trade-offs so what are the

1593
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,240
waves of active inference

1594
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,280
how does aerogenicity come into play

1595
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,200
in these different waves

1596
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,079
so

1597
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,160
i know there's a lot on there but this

1598
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,480
is really a important piece to

1599
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,599
understand

1600
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,319
that there's been recent developments

1601
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,640
and um

1602
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,319
yeah it's still in progress

1603
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,879
okay

1604
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,760
here um this is some technical details

1605
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,760
that would be awesome to just

1606
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,359
learn more from the authors or from

1607
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,640
anyone else

1608
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,839
who

1609
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,960
sees this and gets excited by it

1610
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,319
this is about some of the physics

1611
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,839
formalizations of

1612
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,079
noise and dynamics and phase spaces

1613
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,680
and just

1614
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,839
a term that i was curious about is like

1615
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,000
a co-cycle

1616
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,520
so it's kind of taking that idea of

1617
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
returning to an attracting state and

1618
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,359
maybe connecting it to some other ideas

1619
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,680
like a co-cycle but

1620
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,720
these are just

1621
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,319
things to um

1622
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,880
learn and discuss about

1623
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,000
and then

1624
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,839
this is sort of the classic bayesian

1625
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,240
network markov blanket

1626
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,160
is there a markov blanket that picks out

1627
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,359
the mind

1628
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,359
is the network of autopoetic processes

1629
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,119
and biological systems identical to the

1630
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,280
markov blanket of the system what is the

1631
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,000
metaphysical status of markov blankets

1632
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,920
and then the authors write these debates

1633
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,520
in the metaphysics of the fep can be

1634
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,280
left on the side since we're not

1635
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,760
interested in metaphysics here

1636
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,119
i thought we were having a discussion

1637
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,640
that was meta

1638
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,920
to physics

1639
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,960
so

1640
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,160
where is your metaphysics now

1641
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,400
okay anything else there

1642
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,920
action in the loop

1643
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,319
given this setup free energy theorists

1644
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,000
are interested in finding the active

1645
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,720
states of the systems that are confined

1646
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,799
to a bounded subset of states and remain

1647
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,400
there indefinitely

1648
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
so we want to have our internal states

1649
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,799
be at a certain level like thinking

1650
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,160
about our temperature being at a certain

1651
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,319
value or anything else

1652
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,000
and now we want to talk about the

1653
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,720
control theory question which is what

1654
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,240
active states

1655
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,559
should the system engage in conditioned

1656
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,200
on internal and sensory states

1657
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,920
such that the internal states do remain

1658
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,359
bounded within a subset of states

1659
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,079
more

1660
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,280
uh technical details if one assumes that

1661
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,240
the dynamics of the target organism

1662
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,799
is dynamics is ergotic

1663
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,400
if one assumes that the dynamics of the

1664
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,200
target organism is ergotic

1665
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,440
it's grammatically incorrect if one

1666
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,599
assumes that the dynamics of the target

1667
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,520
organism are ergotic that's why you

1668
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,119
can't read it that's that's why the

1669
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,839
compiler failed then that's it random

1670
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,079
dynamical attractors can be associated

1671
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,160
with the ergodic density a

1672
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,720
p-distribution of x given m

1673
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,079
which is proportional to the amount of

1674
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,559
time each state is occupied by the

1675
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,880
organism so here's where we return to

1676
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,680
their definition of the ergodic density

1677
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,359
as the invariant probability measure

1678
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,880
um there's a few other terms that i know

1679
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
some listeners know about whether

1680
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,400
they'll help us with it's another

1681
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,280
question

1682
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,359
but what does it mean

1683
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,040
to talk about the

1684
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,319
lebesgue measure of the attractor

1685
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,160
how is that connected to dynamical

1686
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,319
systems and entropy and

1687
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,440
whatever this integral is calculating in

1688
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,559
the limit of time approaching infinity

1689
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,720
but this is kind of this thing that we

1690
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,880
see in space and in time

1691
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,760
like

1692
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,160
one over space like what's the tiniest

1693
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,680
infinitesimal space

1694
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,920
for all space or what's the tiniest

1695
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,280
tiniest moment for all time

1696
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,480
so

1697
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,319
how does that connect to

1698
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,160
action control theory

1699
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,720
more more on that later but here even in

1700
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,520
this um even in this slide it raises the

1701
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,480
question

1702
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,960
so here it says such active internal

1703
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,359
states in an organism and so

1704
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,040
maybe it's the way that the diagrams are

1705
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,280
usually drawn for active inference but i

1706
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,240
don't ever think of active states

1707
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,280
as internal states like there's active

1708
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,599
states sensory states internal states

1709
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,520
external states and i always think about

1710
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,559
the sensory and the active states as

1711
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,720
the on the boundary between internal and

1712
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,000
external

1713
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,280
so

1714
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,240
absolutely there um are internal

1715
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,440
external sense and action states so

1716
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,040
what are the active internal states

1717
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,559
there's a few ways of thinking about it

1718
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,880
the particular states are the sense

1719
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,400
action the blanket states and the

1720
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
internal states so maybe that's what's

1721
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,760
being referred to

1722
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,480
or

1723
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,319
we can well when we're talking about

1724
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,240
mental action i guess then the active

1725
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,359
states are internal

1726
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,559
yes

1727
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,280
between the past and the future

1728
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,680
but still eternal right

1729
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,839
like in mental action right yes

1730
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,799
with this prince with this definition of

1731
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,559
active states in hand

1732
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,559
so i believe that we're now working with

1733
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,520
the fristen ontology of the action

1734
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,400
being not the internal states but who

1735
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,359
knows

1736
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,520
first in 2012 finally formulates the

1737
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,480
principle of least action as follows

1738
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,720
the principle of least action

1739
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,119
the internal states of an active system

1740
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,599
so that wouldn't be the action states

1741
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,200
that would be the internal states of a

1742
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,280
system with on the interface having

1743
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,559
action

1744
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,280
they minimize supprisal l

1745
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,839
such that the

1746
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,920
variation delta s of action s

1747
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,319
with respect to its internal states

1748
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,520
r of t

1749
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,440
existing in r vanishes and then classic

1750
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,160
future fristen look at that the 2100s

1751
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,160
are going to be just so good

1752
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,160
the fep would suffice to derive the

1753
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,640
principle of least action and is defined

1754
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,880
by fristen in the past and the future as

1755
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,000
follows

1756
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,920
the free energy principle

1757
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,400
technical technical technical if the

1758
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,119
internal states minimize free energy

1759
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,640
then the system conforms to the

1760
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,119
principle of least action and is an

1761
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,640
active system

1762
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,559
this will be good to unpack and learn

1763
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,640
more from the authors as well as from

1764
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,319
those who studied these areas because

1765
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,480
it's sort of something we all ask is

1766
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,720
like wait least action but then they're

1767
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,640
engaging in action couldn't they just do

1768
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,039
less action wouldn't that be more of a

1769
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,240
fulfillment of the least action

1770
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,000
principle but

1771
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,119
what is it actually it's like a

1772
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,280
stationary principle it's an invariant

1773
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,960
so there's a little bit more nuance than

1774
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,359
just staying on the couch

1775
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,520
and i haven't heard this term active

1776
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,119
system before i've heard like active

1777
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,720
inference system or inactive system but

1778
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,119
this active system is is new to me and

1779
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,880
indeed fristen was a very forward

1780
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,559
thinking guy

1781
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,720
uh he is a very forward-thinking guy all

1782
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,680
the way into the 2100s

1783
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,599
um

1784
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,000
when expressed in these terms so in the

1785
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,240
terms of physics the fep provides us

1786
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,920
with an account of biological

1787
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,319
persistence as a generic type of

1788
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,920
stability

1789
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,960
of random dynamical systems

1790
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,200
so then they talk about first in 2012

1791
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,079
and 13 some simulations

1792
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,520
and then here's what the author's

1793
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,760
challenge is and say let's then put into

1794
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,680
better focus some of the difficulties

1795
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,079
involved in this challenge and ask

1796
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,000
is there any reason to believe that all

1797
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,559
biological systems at any scale can be

1798
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,280
modeled as random dynamical systems

1799
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,839
and how does this maximal generality

1800
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,319
bear on the degree of realism of the

1801
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:35,280
models

1802
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
so we had a few previous discussions ago

1803
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,920
we had um we had realism we had utility

1804
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,839
we had instrumentalism we had all these

1805
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,319
different axes and how are we going to

1806
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,400
manage that trade-off because sometimes

1807
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,240
the most quote realistic description of

1808
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,720
a system isn't the most useful or it's

1809
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,720
not the most general so there's a lot of

1810
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,480
trade-offs happening

1811
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,880
how does model realism relate to

1812
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,119
generalizability and how does that

1813
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,920
relate to the utility of the model as

1814
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,280
well as other attributes like its

1815
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,839
simplicity

1816
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,200
that's like the relationship between the

1817
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,119
map and the territory if you wanted the

1818
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,680
territory then you wouldn't need a map

1819
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,799
yeah

1820
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,880
and then almost like the compass

1821
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,400
um or a piece of paper that just you

1822
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,240
know says like you are here it's like

1823
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,160
it's so general you can always break

1824
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,720
down and that map is going to be

1825
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,280
at least not telling a lie

1826
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,880
you know this is your left or something

1827
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,240
like that this is

1828
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:30,960
but

1829
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,480
is that useful

1830
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,480
it generalizes really well but have we

1831
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,760
lost this whole question of navigation

1832
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,680
in the desire to find the simplest map

1833
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,359
so something that that i wonder about

1834
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,039
like um you know our biological systems

1835
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,280
random dynamical systems like what's a

1836
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,680
non-random dynamical system like a

1837
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,920
dynamical system as opposed to

1838
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,839
like a static system like statics

1839
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,039
dynamics and so like what other system

1840
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:01,839
could

1841
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,680
a biological system b

1842
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,440
like if it if it's not a random

1843
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,160
dynamical system what is the alternate

1844
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,079
of a hypothesis just like what you said

1845
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,920
about like okay well what is the better

1846
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,079
model for cognition if not you know

1847
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,240
active inference then what model

1848
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,920
is the better model right like so but

1849
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,760
what about for a biological system if

1850
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,760
it's not random dynamical system

1851
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,079
what is the best model for a biological

1852
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:25,200
system

1853
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,400
yes

1854
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,000
dynamical through time dynamics random

1855
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,440
used in a lot of different ways but is

1856
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,400
that

1857
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,799
statistical is it stochastic where is

1858
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,880
determinism fit into play

1859
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,039
well let's talk about it so here's

1860
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,799
section four and this is like some of

1861
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,160
the main

1862
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,799
body paragraphs and contributions of the

1863
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,359
paper it's the section modeling

1864
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,599
biological active states as random

1865
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,079
dynamical attractors

1866
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,599
free energy theorists account of

1867
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,839
biological systems persistence relies on

1868
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,000
three main modeling assumptions

1869
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,520
ergodicity

1870
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,359
the existence of markov blankets that

1871
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,880
imply a partition of states into

1872
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,359
external and internal

1873
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,880
the existence of random dynamical

1874
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,319
attractors

1875
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,920
in this section we concentrate on

1876
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,079
assumptions one and three and on the

1877
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,839
more fundamental challenge of defining

1878
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,359
phase bases for target biological

1879
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,000
systems in the life sciences so

1880
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,240
the three core ideas

1881
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,880
that they're saying are

1882
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,440
underlying fep work in biological

1883
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,720
systems are ergodicity markov blankets

1884
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,200
and random dynamical attractors

1885
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,520
are those the main three that's a really

1886
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,599
important question

1887
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,599
this paper is going to focus on the

1888
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,359
first and the third

1889
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,520
not going as much into the markov

1890
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,079
blanket discussion because there's been

1891
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,480
a huge amount of

1892
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,440
discussion on markov blankets and we've

1893
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,400
talked about them severally so

1894
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,880
they're going to focus on ergodicity and

1895
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,119
random dynamical attractors

1896
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,160
that's 4.2 and 3 but that's going to be

1897
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
introduced by a discussion on phase

1898
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,200
spaces in biology so that's what the

1899
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,680
authors have set out to do

1900
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,799
now

1901
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,000
um shameless lab plug

1902
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,680
we're working on an active inference

1903
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,158
ontology in a participatory way that

1904
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,759
includes references

1905
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,120
definitions

1906
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,640
translations into multiple human

1907
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,520
languages it will be many things and it

1908
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,920
will scaffold educational content that

1909
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,600
will make this entire field more

1910
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,560
accessible and rigorous so

1911
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,560
terms like face space

1912
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,319
um we've talked about we talked about

1913
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,120
state space on september 13th

1914
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,479
so every week

1915
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,080
we're bringing together different

1916
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,238
perspectives and sharing resources and

1917
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,960
working towards common understandings in

1918
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,479
this document

1919
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,479
to really get at what are the core

1920
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,520
assumptions of fep or active what do

1921
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,839
these terms mean what would somebody

1922
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,198
need to learn if they wanted to

1923
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,920
understand more so it's really important

1924
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,439
work and we're definitely going to draw

1925
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,158
upon the author's contributions here

1926
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,479
as we work to scaffold an active

1927
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,479
inference ontology so that we don't get

1928
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,839
tied up in active state action state

1929
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,399
systems with action we can be clear

1930
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,158
about how we're talking about this field

1931
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:16,319
and in fact we really have to be

1932
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,719
anything on our ontology document before

1933
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,719
we continue back to the paper

1934
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,920
okay

1935
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,080
but this has been a fun project with

1936
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,279
many contributors

1937
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,279
so let's talk about phase spaces in

1938
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,399
biology

1939
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,479
we introduced this in the earlier

1940
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,479
keyword section

1941
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,040
so the phase space the system is a giant

1942
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,880
space formed by the relevant degrees of

1943
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,439
freedom of the target system

1944
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,319
and then

1945
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,719
that's the space of the possible

1946
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,560
a point in the phase space

1947
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,479
corresponds to microstate

1948
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,158
which completely determines the system

1949
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,080
in terms of the variables and parameters

1950
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,560
required for analyzing its dynamics and

1951
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,120
the dynamics are determined by the

1952
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,040
equations of motion which describe the

1953
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,520
evolution of points or trajectories in

1954
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,600
phase space

1955
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,159
so here's that phase-based kind of model

1956
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,480
and then the authors are going to

1957
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,920
suggest that there's

1958
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,400
at least three facts

1959
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,679
cold hard facts that make face spaces in

1960
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,520
biology hard to apply

1961
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,280
because first biological systems have

1962
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,280
many degrees of freedom it's not just a

1963
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,280
pendulum

1964
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,600
second the symmetries

1965
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,440
which are invariant preserving

1966
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,120
transformations

1967
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,960
underlying the observed regularities in

1968
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,199
biological phenomena are more unstable

1969
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,880
than physics

1970
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,080
okay

1971
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,719
and third the phase space for many real

1972
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,280
world biological targets is much less

1973
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,360
stable than that for the kinds of target

1974
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,000
systems studied in physics

1975
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,159
so what do you think about that or about

1976
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,120
phase spaces in biology

1977
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,719
yeah i mean i think i mentioned the

1978
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,719
multi-dimensionality in the beginning

1979
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,159
when we were talking about the phase

1980
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,640
spaces in biological systems

1981
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,159
um and i think that it just comes to

1982
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,840
that with any

1983
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
um with any system right like you can

1984
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
always include too many parameters like

1985
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,440
you can have the territory or you can

1986
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,360
have a dramatically reduced map and so

1987
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,520
finding that that correct balance is

1988
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,199
hard and if we're looking at um

1989
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,600
you know say states of a system and

1990
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,560
trying to predict the next state

1991
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,600
um

1992
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,560
what

1993
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,320
are all of the factors conditionally

1994
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,800
independent is there some you know

1995
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,920
mingling of the variables there and is

1996
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,640
it okay to just model a couple at a time

1997
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,080
and what if we don't know if there are

1998
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,320
some confounding variables in the system

1999
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,920
too so it's it's a difficult task but

2000
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,840
it's how do we start to get a grip on it

2001
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,960
as hard yes

2002
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,640
and a big question in the background

2003
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,080
here is

2004
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,880
does this matter for applications so yes

2005
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,280
these are in principle critiques of

2006
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,360
doing dynamical phase space models of

2007
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,480
biology

2008
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,960
but we know that dynamical systems

2009
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,400
models of neural systems of

2010
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,000
hormonal systems

2011
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,719
ecology these are all really useful and

2012
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,719
people use them every day so gene

2013
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,120
regulatory networks don't forget those

2014
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,440
how could we forget but does something

2015
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,640
having these sort of fundamental

2016
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,760
critiques

2017
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,600
prevent it from being useful not always

2018
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,040
this is a really nice um

2019
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,800
points about the open-endedness of

2020
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,960
biological phase space

2021
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,199
so this is the work of longo montvale

2022
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,679
and kaufman 2012

2023
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,520
who said that in physics one can

2024
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,360
pre-state the phase space for target

2025
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,360
systems based upon stable stable

2026
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,679
invariances and symmetries

2027
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,440
so we can like say the ball is going to

2028
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,679
be rolling around in the box those are

2029
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,040
the boundaries and here's the

2030
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,560
invariances

2031
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,400
historical processes

2032
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,480
studied in evolutionary and population

2033
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,679
biology

2034
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,199
like all these processes that we know

2035
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,360
and love in biology

2036
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,679
involves symmetry breaking which makes

2037
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,840
the phase spaces structurally unstable

2038
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,239
ever-changing and unpredictable

2039
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,080
now unpredictable is a little bit of a

2040
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,760
tough one because that's a continuum

2041
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,440
what if you can predict one percent of

2042
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,520
the variance in great evolutionary

2043
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,080
transitions is it unpredictable or is it

2044
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
predictable you know is it half full or

2045
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,440
half empty

2046
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,600
and then this is from the paper

2047
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,520
because we cannot pre-state

2048
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,960
the ever-changing phase base of

2049
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,800
biological evolution we have no settled

2050
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,880
relations by which we can write down the

2051
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,320
equations of motion

2052
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,480
of the ever new biologically relevant

2053
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,400
observables and parameters

2054
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,480
but that we cannot pre-state

2055
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,560
more we cannot pre-state the adaptive

2056
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,719
niche as a boundary condition so could

2057
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,320
not integrate the equations of motion

2058
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,239
even were we to have them all so it's

2059
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,080
like there's the ball rolling around on

2060
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,920
the billiards table but now there's

2061
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,320
mutations in the genome of the ball so

2062
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,000
that there's like totally new mechanisms

2063
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,679
arising in a way that might have a

2064
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,120
historiosity

2065
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,520
oh yeah and the table is mutating and

2066
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,440
it's made up of other organisms so it's

2067
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,679
easy to see how we get lost in the

2068
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,360
complexity

2069
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,840
yet adaptive action exists and useful

2070
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,400
models exist so how do we reconcile the

2071
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,840
fundamental open-endedness and

2072
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,159
creativity and novelty of evolution with

2073
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,320
our desire to explain some portion of

2074
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,880
the variance so we can act effectively

2075
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,719
well and this relates like to a question

2076
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,159
that i had brought up to you um

2077
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,320
yesterday daniel i think about like what

2078
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,280
about discretizing space and so i know

2079
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,280
that like some of the physics principles

2080
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,199
rely on infinite time like the

2081
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,760
ergodicity specifically relies on the

2082
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,679
possibility of infinite time and this is

2083
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,440
all stuff that's like kind of beyond me

2084
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,600
but but what if we have a temporarily

2085
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,760
restricted moment right like what if

2086
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,360
we're just interested about now and five

2087
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,040
years from now or what if we're just

2088
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,360
interested in now and five years ago

2089
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,960
right and and so

2090
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,960
in each moment is this symmetry breaking

2091
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,679
happening or at what scale and so is

2092
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,920
there perhaps a chunk of time a small

2093
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,239
discrete chunk of time from you know a

2094
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,280
microsecond to 100 years

2095
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,159
where

2096
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,440
these types of um inferences can be used

2097
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,040
and where the equations are applicable

2098
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,199
and where we can use the model with

2099
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,040
under the you know specification that

2100
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,560
this model is not good for the next two

2101
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,880
million years but it will last you 20.

2102
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,679
right like so it's a model of the phase

2103
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,400
space of blood glucose versus ph

2104
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,840
in a person

2105
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,760
as measured by the devices we have it's

2106
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,760
not of blood sugar over a million years

2107
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,199
because that doesn't even make sense

2108
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,199
given the system of interest so how do

2109
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,760
we reconcile pragmatics and utility with

2110
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,760
these really important philosophical

2111
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,600
questions so that was four one face

2112
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,800
spaces

2113
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,320
word two

2114
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,840
ergodicity

2115
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,600
one of the assumptions of the fep is

2116
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,239
that all biological systems are ergodic

2117
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,120
so

2118
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,159
paging

2119
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,560
ramstead at all at all

2120
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,159
this is something we really want to

2121
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,159
unpack and understand like

2122
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,080
how how does it

2123
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,880
mean

2124
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,199
ergodicity or more precisely metric

2125
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,520
transitivity in random dynamical systems

2126
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,920
like what is the math and the physics

2127
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,560
and is that an assumption of the fep

2128
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,400
what does this mean to assume that

2129
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,000
biological systems quote are ergotic

2130
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,360
which is different than saying

2131
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,679
biological systems for some spatial

2132
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,920
temporal scales can be modeled using

2133
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,000
statistics that involve

2134
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,679
ergotic assumptions

2135
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,320
so there's a lot of nuance there like

2136
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,159
whether we're making realist claims

2137
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,640
about how biological systems are

2138
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,440
or whether we're using statistics in an

2139
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,640
instrumental fashion to make useful

2140
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,440
um

2141
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,000
models of organisms but the big

2142
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,480
questions are like what kinds of systems

2143
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,800
are ergodic and how

2144
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
what are the implications of ergotic

2145
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,880
assumption is it ever not an assumption

2146
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,400
but it's actually like a consequence of

2147
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,880
some empirical grounding

2148
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,199
there's the ergotic hierarchy so

2149
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,760
ergodicity it's not just like yes or no

2150
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,679
there's a total continuum with a lot of

2151
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,199
complex math

2152
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,560
and then just

2153
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,000
for everyone

2154
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,239
how or where does this matter

2155
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,080
for modeling under the fep or active

2156
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,840
inference in real world situations

2157
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,640
and they did call out in the paper um a

2158
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,440
reference to ramstead and the local

2159
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,080
ergodicity which is you know for a

2160
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,000
biological organism i'm like something

2161
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,239
like the you know boundaries in which

2162
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,880
the organism can exist

2163
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,000
um anyway i think uh maxwell come come

2164
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,280
explain it to us please but um

2165
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,159
the authors did mention that so

2166
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,400
here's a quote from the paper

2167
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,960
bierkoff 1931

2168
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,880
demonstrated that if a dynamical system

2169
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,040
is ergotic then the infinite time limit

2170
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,120
exists and coincides with the phase

2171
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,719
average for almost all initial

2172
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,120
conditions little x like the realized

2173
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,360
conditions within the bigger x like the

2174
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
space of the possible

2175
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,840
this is called the ergodic theorem

2176
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,440
and that is going to get linked to

2177
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,199
everything we were just discussing

2178
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,080
surprisal minimization as ergodicity

2179
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,199
maintenance

2180
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,520
and then here the proof of the principle

2181
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,880
of least action

2182
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,560
is straightforward

2183
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,080
okay

2184
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,000
and rests on noting

2185
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,280
that action

2186
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,360
and the entropy of the ergodic density

2187
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,679
over external states are related via the

2188
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,400
ergodic theorem firsten past and the

2189
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,520
future

2190
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,320
so

2191
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,760
pnas

2192
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,760
burkhoff 1931

2193
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,000
pretty interesting paper and just

2194
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,840
it's amazing to think like how in 100

2195
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,880
years of mathematics after this but this

2196
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,239
is kind of that initial formulization of

2197
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,159
what if the space average and the time

2198
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,159
average were going to be

2199
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,640
related to each other

2200
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,159
so it's a cool topic we've brought up

2201
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,480
ergodicity before and it would be really

2202
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,159
helpful for people who know some of the

2203
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,000
technical details to help

2204
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,040
work with it

2205
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,840
this is one um analogous to how they

2206
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
brought up like here's the facts that

2207
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,239
challenge phase spaces in biology so

2208
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,320
here's some facts that challenge the

2209
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,480
application of ergotic theorems to real

2210
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,080
systems

2211
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,080
and there's good reasons the authors say

2212
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,440
to think that the theorem cannot be

2213
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,040
realistically applied in the domain of

2214
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,040
biology so

2215
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,920
first off it's not enough to show

2216
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,679
that

2217
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,320
the infinite limit exists it also has to

2218
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,000
be shown that the convergence rate is

2219
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,520
plausible we're going to talk about that

2220
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,360
in a second

2221
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,520
second point comparing biological to

2222
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,600
non-biological systems

2223
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,600
it's harder to estimate the amount of

2224
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,640
time

2225
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,679
that they need to kind of asymptote

2226
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,480
because of the non-uniformities

2227
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,320
another reason and this is going to be

2228
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,000
one that i know people will have things

2229
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,440
to say

2230
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,199
why ergodicity cannot plausibly be

2231
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,960
assumed in biology

2232
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,719
is that the ergotic theorem requires the

2233
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,880
dynamics of the system to be ergotic

2234
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,719
which means that eventually

2235
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,800
almost every point will visit every

2236
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,880
measurable region in x

2237
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,640
we've talked about that before like but

2238
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,480
biological systems never revisit the

2239
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,440
exact same state if you think about

2240
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,040
every molecule constituting the phase

2241
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,040
space but if the phase base is just

2242
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,120
temperature versus blood sugar

2243
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,920
yes you pretty much will revisit some

2244
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,520
points but will you revisit every point

2245
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,120
are you going to reach a value of

2246
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,320
negative 5 000 sugar and 900 degrees

2247
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,000
celsius no

2248
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,719
we're talking about bounded states

2249
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:19,679
and

2250
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,000
that's kind of a nuance

2251
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,239
and then well and also it's also the

2252
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,360
arrow of time is is moving forward right

2253
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,120
it points one direction and so like you

2254
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,520
know at age 40 my skin will never have

2255
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,520
the collagen it had at age four like

2256
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,440
that's never going to happen again right

2257
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,280
so i mean and there are some things that

2258
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,679
just decrease as you age

2259
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,480
yes

2260
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,480
so there are yeah

2261
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,159
let's look at this palacios 2018 paper

2262
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:47,360
so this is

2263
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,000
i guess an earlier paper by the first

2264
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,239
author so it kind of gives a little

2265
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,480
context

2266
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,400
had we but world enough and time

2267
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,560
but we don't

2268
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,000
exclamation point

2269
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,120
colon

2270
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,800
justifying the thermodynamic and

2271
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,880
infinite hyphen time limits in

2272
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,560
statistical mechanics

2273
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,840
great title well punctuated uh a bevy of

2274
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,080
punctuations and this is just a very

2275
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,000
interesting paper that we skimmed over

2276
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,440
and i'm sure there's a ton to say it'd

2277
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,560
be great to

2278
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,000
speak with the author about it but

2279
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,600
they argue that this has there's an

2280
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,800
important consequence for the

2281
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,320
philosophical literature on infinite

2282
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,600
limits

2283
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,120
and that's basically it's not just about

2284
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,120
like where you are

2285
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,639
that's where you are in face space it's

2286
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,159
about where you're going that's the

2287
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,400
asymptote in infinite time

2288
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,159
and it also matters how fast you're

2289
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,440
going to get there

2290
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,440
so it's like kind of the asymptote for a

2291
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,040
pane of glass

2292
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,880
is like in a puddle on the ground

2293
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,080
because it's a liquid or it's a glass

2294
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,600
but that might take

2295
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,040
so long

2296
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,040
that over some time scale it can be

2297
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,360
modeled as if it's not changing for

2298
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,560
example

2299
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,400
so that's kind of a cool notion that

2300
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,760
it's not just about

2301
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,000
where a system is or where it's being

2302
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,400
attracted towards but actually the

2303
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,679
dynamics of the approach matter a lot

2304
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,120
and that's certainly true in biological

2305
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,519
systems

2306
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,120
um the assumption of erodicity to give a

2307
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,960
definition of equilibrium states is a

2308
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,800
controversial assumption even in the

2309
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,360
domain of physics especially due to

2310
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,360
existence of physical systems in

2311
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,280
equilibrium that have proven to be

2312
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
non-ergotic so i didn't find this

2313
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,120
palacios 21 citation in the biblio

2314
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,719
this is the reason why physicists and

2315
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,040
philosophers have offered alternative

2316
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,639
approaches to equilibrium that do not

2317
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,639
rely on erica d

2318
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,679
even philosophers that defend a

2319
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:47,600
quasi-ergodic approach to equilibrium

2320
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,040
recognize that this definition of

2321
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,960
equilibrium may plausibly apply only to

2322
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,960
a restricted class of systems such as

2323
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,719
gases

2324
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,080
so

2325
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,040
sounds

2326
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,239
bad

2327
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,760
but then we go okay

2328
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,440
the authors say it doesn't mean of

2329
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,600
course that ergodicity or a weaker

2330
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,600
notion of local ergodicity may sometimes

2331
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,719
be a reasonable assumption to make

2332
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,600
so in other words it might be useful

2333
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,960
for specifically defined systems anyway

2334
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,320
however the fact that one cannot

2335
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,080
extrapolate the assumption of ergodicity

2336
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,600
to the behavior of all relevant systems

2337
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,000
in biology cast doubt on the project of

2338
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,920
formulating a principle that depends on

2339
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,120
this assumption

2340
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,280
and is both maximally general and

2341
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,920
biologically realistic

2342
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,080
so ideas that we've heard a little bit

2343
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,679
about but how are we going to finesse

2344
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,040
realism

2345
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,320
and

2346
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,000
generality

2347
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,239
and grounding in physics when biological

2348
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,440
systems might be grounded and things

2349
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,320
that

2350
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,920
are not fulfilled

2351
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,159
so that's 4.2

2352
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,280
all right

2353
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,560
4-3 random dynamical attractors

2354
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,719
what makes the application of fep to

2355
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,480
account for real-world behavior

2356
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,000
biological systems

2357
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,560
is even more challenging beyond 4.2 and

2358
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,760
4.1

2359
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,360
because one also has to show the

2360
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,679
existence of an attractor

2361
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,080
and also justify

2362
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,320
why certain attractors but not others

2363
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,639
plausibly denote homeostatic states in

2364
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,320
the target

2365
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,040
there might be multiple attractors

2366
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,719
and then there's this question of

2367
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,000
chaotic systems do you want to add

2368
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,560
anything on these

2369
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,880
basically it's non-trivial to say that

2370
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,400
there's an attractor and it's the right

2371
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,120
one and it results in adaptive behavior

2372
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,239
there's a lot that goes into it

2373
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,199
so

2374
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,400
but

2375
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,080
we can learn more we'll hear more

2376
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,080
questions later and then just to go

2377
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,000
quickly to five and six

2378
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,400
so five discussion

2379
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,080
in the previous sections we've analyzed

2380
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,520
three challenges involved in the

2381
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,199
justification of the free energy

2382
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,159
principle

2383
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:50,000
so one was pre-stated phase spaces

2384
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,080
for most biological systems

2385
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,960
two

2386
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,360
was the lack of the warrant

2387
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,040
for making ergodicity assumptions in

2388
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,400
biology

2389
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,840
and three is the challenge of

2390
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,320
identifying homeostasis

2391
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,199
with attractors in a phase space even if

2392
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,440
one and two were accomplished

2393
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,040
based on our analysis

2394
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,280
one overall conclusion is that

2395
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,960
because of a fundamental mismatch

2396
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,719
between its physics assumptions and the

2397
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,120
properties of biological targets

2398
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,440
model building grounded in the fep

2399
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,840
achieves maximal generality

2400
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,719
yay

2401
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,159
for minimal biological plausibility

2402
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,360
bat

2403
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,239
so

2404
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,800
how is that going to work

2405
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,639
as we raised earlier

2406
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:33,440
how

2407
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,600
does generality versus plausibility get

2408
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,080
traded off for real systems

2409
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,520
in the fvp

2410
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,560
in active and in what other frameworks

2411
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,040
let's always have another one if people

2412
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,960
want to or can think of one so that

2413
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,880
we're not just asking whether it's like

2414
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,040
as good as it could be because here's a

2415
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,199
hint it's not as good as it could be

2416
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,800
we're always going to see ways to

2417
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,719
improve the theory

2418
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,199
and the literature if only by organizing

2419
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,440
other work and making it more accessible

2420
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,400
so

2421
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,320
what is its relative biological

2422
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,840
plausibility what is its relative

2423
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,480
generalizability and what are we

2424
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,159
relativizing too

2425
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,679
because as they say

2426
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,520
like for other idealized scientific

2427
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,679
representations even if the fep involves

2428
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,840
simplifying distortions it does not

2429
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,880
follow

2430
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,639
that it must be minimally realistic and

2431
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,800
have limited explanatory or predictive

2432
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,120
power

2433
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,960
so they're saying like it's kind of like

2434
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,800
enemy my enemy is my friend it's like

2435
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,280
saying just because you idealize and

2436
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,400
simplify

2437
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,239
that it doesn't mean that you're gonna

2438
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:37,040
get explanation or prediction

2439
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,760
so

2440
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,280
that's their discussion

2441
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,719
they

2442
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,280
fall back to the three key points

2443
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,679
that they think challenge

2444
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,199
the usage of physics ideas in biology

2445
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,520
that are postulated to be underlying the

2446
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,800
fep phase spaces erikaticity and random

2447
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,639
attractors

2448
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,639
and they're concluding that there's a

2449
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,400
mismatch between the physics assumptions

2450
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,000
and the properties of biological targets

2451
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,560
here in the implications and predictions

2452
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,400
they write

2453
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,880
if the fep or active inference models it

2454
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,159
grounds

2455
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,560
make simplifying distortions

2456
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,000
distorting assumptions about the phase

2457
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,159
space of a target system the ergodicity

2458
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,159
of biological systems and the existence

2459
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,760
of an attracting set corresponding to

2460
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,040
homeostatic states for these systems

2461
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,719
then these idealizations should earn

2462
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,199
their keep so you know

2463
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,600
you've been a bad theory but

2464
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,520
it's not all over you could be a good

2465
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,360
theory you could earn your keep maybe in

2466
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,040
the future

2467
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,600
and then they um write

2468
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,760
um

2469
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,679
these idealizations should allow life

2470
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,280
scientists to attractively draw some

2471
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,639
explanation and prediction about

2472
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,560
relevant biological observables in real

2473
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,480
world systems and assess those

2474
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,760
predictions against measurements

2475
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,000
relevant to understanding some aspect of

2476
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
homeostatic processes in actual

2477
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,600
biological systems

2478
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,560
decosta at all 2020.

2479
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,639
our contention is that the idealizations

2480
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,400
made by free energy theorists do not

2481
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,520
play these practical and epistemic roles

2482
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,159
and so this is the de costa at all 2020

2483
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,080
active inference on discrete state

2484
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,000
spaces a synthesis

2485
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,120
and um

2486
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,679
here are from table one here's all the

2487
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,120
applications

2488
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,120
so it's interesting because like this

2489
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,199
pragmatic and epistemic

2490
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,600
role that's kind of the ontology of

2491
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,880
active inference that's how we talk

2492
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,199
about policy selection

2493
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,639
and then it's like

2494
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,360
okay looking at this list i'm seeing a

2495
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,760
lot of pragmatic and epistemic value

2496
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:42,639
but

2497
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,320
what is the contention

2498
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,280
that the idealizations themself

2499
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,760
do not play pragmatic or epistemically

2500
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,440
valuable roles

2501
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,719
i think it'd be good to get a little

2502
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:55,440
clarification because table one has a

2503
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,679
lot of and since then even

2504
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,840
there's a lot of interesting areas what

2505
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,520
do you think about that blue

2506
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,360
yeah it's interesting like the word

2507
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,480
choice of the author here like the

2508
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,920
idealizations made by the

2509
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,639
free energy theorists theorists so what

2510
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,000
are these idealizations like the

2511
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,480
reliance on ergodicity and random

2512
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,719
dynamical systems theory like are these

2513
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,840
idealizations or is it actually using

2514
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,760
the fep and active inference for

2515
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,239
practical applications that don't play

2516
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,960
the practical and epistemic roles so i

2517
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,760
just i'm curious as to that word choice

2518
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,320
and steven in the chat wrote the use of

2519
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,520
approximation science around ergodicity

2520
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,880
could give the potential to have

2521
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,880
sufficient revisiting of states to make

2522
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,639
meaningfulness plausible

2523
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,239
how can we measure when sufficient

2524
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,639
approximation to erodicity exists in

2525
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,639
order to make variational free energy

2526
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:47,760
inferences

2527
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,639
so good question we can ask and as we

2528
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,760
kind of explored revisitation is one

2529
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,000
component of ergodicity but also there's

2530
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,520
this element of

2531
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,639
re of revisiting every point and of

2532
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,960
exploring the whole phase space so

2533
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,600
as we kind of addressed what is

2534
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,840
the reality of arrogancity and applying

2535
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,560
those models to biological systems and

2536
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,040
then yeah can we use approximations and

2537
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,239
approximation science to make it work

2538
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,840
even if in the infinite perfect case

2539
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,760
it doesn't exactly seem like it would

2540
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,840
like the t-test assumes that there's an

2541
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,920
equal variance between the two groups

2542
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,520
unless you have a t-test within equal

2543
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,880
variances

2544
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,000
yet

2545
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,679
no two groups in reality are going to

2546
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,880
have the exact same variance yet the

2547
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,480
t-test works

2548
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,800
so how can we take that same approach

2549
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,000
and think about the systems that we're

2550
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,920
working with here

2551
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,960
here's their whole conclusion

2552
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,679
in a churning mail storm

2553
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,159
they're arguing that fep theorists have

2554
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,400
pursued maximal generalization

2555
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,719
by relying on physics concepts

2556
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,000
however that means that they've

2557
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,639
sacrificed biological realism

2558
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,120
and the danger of sacrificing biological

2559
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,440
realism is that you risk

2560
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,239
minimizing explanatory and predictive

2561
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,199
power

2562
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,800
of those accounts

2563
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,120
for biological systems which are

2564
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,520
homeostatic and

2565
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,080
manifestingly far from equilibrium in

2566
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,600
their persistence

2567
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,280
and their last paragraph

2568
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,280
the fep can perhaps be better understood

2569
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,080
as a maximally general definition of any

2570
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,320
system that persists

2571
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,000
but this definition does not seem to

2572
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,920
provide us with any new insight into

2573
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,400
biological systems

2574
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,080
to the extent free energy theorists

2575
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,920
treat all biological systems at any

2576
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,639
scale as pre-specific pre-specified

2577
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,280
generic objects with fixed

2578
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,920
currently unknown equations of motion

2579
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,000
their account risks missing all features

2580
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,320
that make biological systems interesting

2581
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,880
kinds of thermodynamic systems so it's

2582
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,239
like you know a city where there's all

2583
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,480
kinds of intersections and then you have

2584
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,199
a grid map and so we distort the system

2585
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,120
in a way where all of a sudden we

2586
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,960
thought we were generalizing but we

2587
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,760
ended up losing touch with the system

2588
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,840
and therefore explanatory and predictive

2589
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,639
power

2590
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,000
any thoughts on the conclusion

2591
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,120
um no i mean i think that that

2592
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,600
you know they have made their point

2593
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,600
pretty clearly so um

2594
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,239
i think the fep also has a lot of room

2595
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,159
to grow being that it's

2596
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:27,280
you know relatively not not quite 20 yet

2597
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,760
so i think that um you know hopefully

2598
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,120
that

2599
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,560
some

2600
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,639
pragmatic and epistemic value will be

2601
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,080
put forth by

2602
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,880
um the generalizations made by the fep

2603
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,120
in some future model perhaps

2604
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,120
that's almost like a deep time

2605
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,280
sociological value

2606
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,679
even a provocative theory which has

2607
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:50,080
limited epistemic or pragmatic value not

2608
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,960
saying the fpp is could play a role in a

2609
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,360
broader social system

2610
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,360
that still gets the job done so that's

2611
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,360
kind of a cool notion

2612
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,760
what questions for 31.1

2613
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,120
did you put up

2614
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,280
so i think i raised them all already so

2615
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,679
like what is the dynamic equilibrium of

2616
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,800
living systems as the authors state here

2617
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,480
and as i stated in the beginning

2618
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,239
keywords

2619
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:15,920
and it says we should pay closer

2620
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,760
attention to the fundamental differences

2621
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,480
between physics and biology like what

2622
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,480
are the differences between physics and

2623
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,639
biology like in the paper they made

2624
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,560
they went to a great length to explain

2625
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,719
like why biological systems weren't

2626
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:31,840
ergotic but then also like they made the

2627
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,040
point that

2628
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,560
physics they have they have a really

2629
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,800
hard time like proving ergonomy exists

2630
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,760
at all um in any physical system so so

2631
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,199
what are what are these fundamental

2632
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,040
differences between physics and biology

2633
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,520
that that are so critical like that it

2634
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,199
seems that you know the fep kind of

2635
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,560
misses the point

2636
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,159
um and then they refer often in the

2637
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,040
paper to active states as as internal

2638
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,639
states and i i just wonder

2639
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,320
what like i mean i've really thought

2640
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,159
about active states as like the

2641
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,840
interface between internal and external

2642
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,920
and part of the blanket and so i just

2643
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,760
wonder why

2644
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,159
the active states are included in

2645
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,000
internal states and their you know

2646
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,800
description of the model so so just some

2647
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,880
some technical things that i have

2648
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,639
questions about and um you know

2649
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:19,760
hopefully the authors will be here to

2650
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,360
answer them cool

2651
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,719
stephen wrote

2652
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,639
we may never know the whole phase space

2653
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:27,120
as the phase space may be variable yes

2654
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,719
that's what we talked about like the

2655
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,159
phase base of temperature does that

2656
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:31,360
include

2657
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,040
impossible temperatures that the system

2658
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,120
cannot persist at and then the fact that

2659
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,199
the phase space can change is the

2660
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:38,639
open-endedness

2661
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,080
of the um the longo i think 2012

2662
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,679
open-endedness of the phase space in

2663
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,159
biological systems so for sure that's

2664
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,960
why we can read the papes and then have

2665
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,960
specific citations and ontologies in

2666
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,199
mind so we're not kind of cross angling

2667
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:54,880
because those are great points and they

2668
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,800
were the points made in the paper

2669
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,040
and then stephen asks is biological

2670
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,679
realism based upon folk biological

2671
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:02,719
assumptions

2672
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,560
so i think this sort of like folk

2673
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,199
hyphenated everything has come into the

2674
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,600
forefront with the discussion with matt

2675
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,480
sims

2676
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,679
so yeah

2677
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:12,800
what is

2678
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,560
biologically real

2679
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,719
you know what models are biologically

2680
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,400
realistic isn't that just like the

2681
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,159
question of what is real

2682
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,719
so yeah what is even real at all exactly

2683
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,040
yeah realism sounds good until you

2684
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,119
so you ask too many questions

2685
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,960
so

2686
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,119
what a fun discussion

2687
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,400
so we ask all these questions like

2688
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,639
what does a good understanding enable

2689
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,000
what are the unique predictions and

2690
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,840
implications of this paper

2691
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,000
what are the next steps for fep and

2692
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,280
active

2693
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,600
what are the goals of this research

2694
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,080
and then what are we still curious about

2695
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,360
it was a

2696
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,840
fun discussion so thanks a ton blue for

2697
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,000
doing it and for working a ton on the

2698
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,360
slides

2699
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,119
we'll look forward to

2700
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,960
31.1 and beyond

2701
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,880
awesome thanks bye

2702
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,880
bye
