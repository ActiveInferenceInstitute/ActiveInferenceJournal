00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,200
hello and welcome everyone to actin flab

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,239
live stream number 31.1

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
yes we are live

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
so today it's october 19th 2021 and

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,039
we're going to be having a discussion on

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,840
the paper non-equilibrium thermodynamics

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
and the free energy principle in biology

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,599
so welcome to the active inference lab

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,558
everyone

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,280
we are a participatory online lab that

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,079
is communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,480
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,280
at the links here on this page

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
this is a recorded and an archived live

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
stream so please provide us with

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,160
feedback so that we can improve our work

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,079
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,640
welcome here and we'll be following good

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
video etiquette for live streams

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
at this short link you can see the past

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
and upcoming live streams here we are at

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,360
the end of october 2021 in paper number

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
31

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
and today we're going to be having an

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
awesome group discussion and then next

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
week we hope to have one or both of the

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
authors join us so we'll be taking a lot

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
of notes today and

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
bringing up good things to talk with

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
them on and all of these are

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
participatory live streams so if you

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
want to join or if you want to

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119
co-organize with us just let us know

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
today in 31.1

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
we're just going to be learning and

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
discussing this paper of palacios and

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,360
colombo

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
and

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
we're just

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
putting out some perspectives giving

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
some affordances for others to join in

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
and

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,159
hopefully learning along the way so we

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,560
have a few questions that blue and

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
others have prepared

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,399
maxwell also prepared some

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
notes to talk about and we're just

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,079
pretty much going to

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,680
look through the questions that we have

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,719
already

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
written up we'll add more

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
anyone in the youtube live chat who

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
wants to ask a question they're more

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
than welcome to do so and we'll just hop

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
around wherever we need to go

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
we'll start off with the introductions

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
so we'll just say hi and

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
maybe something that we liked about the

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
paper or something that stuck with us or

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,319
something that

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,360
brought us to this conversation so

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
california

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
and i think something i'm excited about

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
today

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
maybe would be to look at this

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
intersection of biology and

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
thermodynamics

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,120
and

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
talk a little bit about the different

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
ways we can approach that intersection

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,599
this paper has some formalisms but not

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,319
all the formalisms there weren't figures

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
but there's so many graphical intuitions

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
related to free energy landscapes and

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
some other pieces so it's just kind of

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
cool to think about what are the

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
different ways that we come to learn

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
about the intersections of these cool

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
ideas and i'll pass to stephen

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
hello yes stephen i'm in toronto in

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
canada um

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
pleased to be here again and i'm

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
interested in this paper the general

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
topic of ergodicity comes up and um i'm

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
interested to see i often see these

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
papers which have sort of free energy

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
principle focus rather than say active

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
inference focus so

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
um just to see how in that when that

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,840
tree gets shaken how that helps or

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,680
hinders the sort of more processed

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,440
theory work which is probably closer to

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
where i'm

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,519
uh

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
interested in but this is all very

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
interesting thanks i'll pass it over to

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
maxwell

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
hey i'm maxwell ramstead

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
i'm the ceo of nested minds network an

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
active inference ai startup and i am a

102
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
fellow at the welcome center for human

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,519
neuroimaging

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,879
ucl in london

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
i'm looking forward to

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
discussing

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
this paper i think there's a lot to

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,319
disagree with

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,360
and i'll try to be collegial

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
in my criticism

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
beautiful what more could we ask for

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,000
let's

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
start with uh

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,840
the big question and of course

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
either of you if you have a different

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
take or there's other big questions

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
but this big question which is in this

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
paper as well as the broader

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
literature

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,840
what fundamental ideas from physics

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,560
are utilized in free energy principle

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
and active inference and how

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
and just

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,479
what are the implications or trade-offs

125
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,600
associated with the use of this idea

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
does it lend credibility to a theory to

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
be grounded in physics what does it mean

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
to a theory for it to be grounded in a

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
certain physical idea does it constrain

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
does it prevent us from making the kinds

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,440
of conclusions that we might want to

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
draw about biological systems so that's

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,840
kind of the big

134
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,919
question do either of you have any other

135
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,880
sort of

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,600
big questions that this raises or

137
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
what is the alignment of like the vector

138
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,800
of this paper with bigger ongoing

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
threads in our research community

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
well i mean i guess one outstanding

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
question for me is uh what is the

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
horizon of relevant literature

143
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,919
in terms of time

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,880
course

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
that one needs to consider

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,320
before you know trying to

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
engage with and criticize this material

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
it's something that comes up i think

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
and it might be useful to discuss

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
maybe before we go into the specifics

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
there just when we're engaging

152
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,160
in

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
scholarship or we're diving into fields

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
where we might not have taken courses to

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
the undergraduate or higher level just

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
it's a really important question how do

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
we

159
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
make

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
appropriate claims you know how do you

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
take a little bit of a of a dip into the

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
rabbit hole

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,039
and come out with something that's

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,080
useful

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,639
rather than just being more confused

166
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
than when you made the initial search so

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
these are

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
big questions any

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,479
thoughts are just how do we determine

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
what literature are relevant like if we

171
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
wanted to write a paper on something

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,240
related to active inference or just in

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
general what do we do do we do keywords

174
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,919
do we only look at the last five years

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
are you asking the question rhetorically

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,840
or do you want us to chime in oh maybe

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
steven first with a raised hand but then

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,479
just either

179
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
a mute stephen and then yes

180
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
stephen unmute and then continue

181
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
i'm probably not the best person because

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,319
i keep digging and digging and digging

183
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
but um

184
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,800
i think it's a good question i i i'm

185
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
from a chemistry background a long way

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,639
back and i always find it interesting as

187
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,319
well because you know a lot of stuff

188
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,440
that's

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,880
used is or developed it comes from

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
chemistry actually um

191
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,400
uh and uses physics but uh

192
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
you know the the the like you say that

193
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
we're in this kind of

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,319
need to

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
approximate and an approximation what

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
like there's so many things that come up

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,319
that are like new

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,199
new

199
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
ways of describing stuff which makes

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
total sense like i i've read through the

201
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
free energy principle and kristin's work

202
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,440
about the talk about approximation

203
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
science and that science is is

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
ultimately an approximation

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
and then you know it takes me a couple

206
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
of days to then get my head around that

207
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
and it's like yeah that totally makes

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,319
sense but the implications of all of

209
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,720
that are huge the implications of being

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
in non-equilibrium

211
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
states

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
itself

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
disrupts a lot of the accuracy of

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,000
of

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
certain ways that you can roll out

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
things from physics and are you rolling

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
out into chemistry which is normally

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
equilibrium chemistry

219
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,759
are we rolling it out straight into

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,520
biology are we rolling it out into

221
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,759
something slightly different with all

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
this modelling so

223
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
i think it does

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,039
cause some challenges in terms of

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
discussions because

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
it's easy for other people to start

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
telling

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
the free energy principle

229
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
and active influence community what they

230
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
are and then start telling them

231
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
and framing what they're not

232
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
and by which point it's kind of hard to

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
have a discussion because it's like the

234
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,399
straw man's been set up

235
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
and i think that can be a little bit

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,040
challenging for some conversations to

237
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
move forward because now you've got a

238
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
complex idea

239
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
trying to

240
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
first of all

241
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
counter

242
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
the fact that other people's paradigms

243
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
have been challenged

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,279
uh so i think that itself

245
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,640
um i don't know if that's a literature

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
thing or whether that's a cognitive

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
thing but i think that that is part of

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the challenge that seems to be faced

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
agree steven thanks for that and it's

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
maybe a good segue maxwell we can just

251
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
start to hear some of your thoughts and

252
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
all be typing some notes and maybe

253
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
asking some

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
follow-ups and unpacking because i know

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
you'll have a lot to

256
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
say on this so maybe just

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
go for it and i'll just type along and

258
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,399
we'll see where we go i mean um i guess

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
that

260
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
probably the thing that i find most

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
puzzling about the paper is that it

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
claims to be the first in the literature

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,839
essentially

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
to be looking at the connection between

265
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
the physics of the free energy both

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,880
physics

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
and the free energy principle

268
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:01,920
and

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
i find this puzzling because it seems to

270
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
me that

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,279
the connection between physics and the

272
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,920
free energy principle has been really

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
maybe thus the focus

274
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
of active research in our community for

275
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
like

276
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,320
four years or so um so i mean you know

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
the

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
carl published or at least pre-printed

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
his uh

280
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
particular physics monograph in january

281
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
2019

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
um and you know prior to that we had all

283
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
been working on

284
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,000
i mean effectively the connections to

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
physics so

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
uh i find this problematic because the

287
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
work that we're going to discuss today

288
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,720
focuses on you know

289
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
older formulations of the free energy

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
principle where the connections to

291
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,640
physics were maybe less obvious

292
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
i mean as most of us in the community

293
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
know now

294
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
the formal foundations of the free

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
energy principle have been subject to

296
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
extensive debate over the last you know

297
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,040
three years or so

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
uh

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
kind of martin beale and colleagues kind

300
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
of started um started us off in this

301
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
direction and you know uh since um

302
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,279
martin and uh you know a few other uh

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
groups of uh produced

304
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,560
uh you know

305
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
have stimulated interesting discussion

306
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,079
through their very interesting and

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,600
technically rigorous critiques of the

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
free energy principle but really it

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
seems to me that this has been like

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
a focus of our discussions for the last

311
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,839
several years the connections to physics

312
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
and so on um

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
you know and where this has gotten us is

314
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
uh the bayesian mechanics for stationary

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
processes paper that was recently

316
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,079
released

317
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,880
um which accounts for

318
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
the critical

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
remarks that have been raised and you

320
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
know it so really where we're at now is

321
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
that we have uh formulations that start

322
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
from

323
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics

324
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,639
and information geometry

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,720
um and end up

326
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
you know saying well

327
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,839
all systems that have stationary density

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
dynamics and a markov blanket

329
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
will look as if their internal states

330
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
are uh

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
you know modeling in a

332
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
loose sense or in a more technical sense

333
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
encoding the parameters of probability

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
distributions or bayesian beliefs about

335
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
external states that's sort of where

336
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
we're left with and you get you get to

337
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
this from the physics so i just found

338
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,839
that the um

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
the remark was a bit puzzling and the

340
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
choice of literature was also i think a

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,200
little

342
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,079
uh

343
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
puzzling for the

344
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,959
the same reasons i mean i i have more

345
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,440
specific thoughts but

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,639
uh

347
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
i mean you know this is sort of for your

348
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
first bullet point in response to the

349
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
last one that we added what's the

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
relevant time horizon i feel like a

351
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
rapidly developing theory like the

352
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,839
active inference framework and the free

353
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
energy principle i mean if you're going

354
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
to be producing

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
technical critical material

356
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,279
you

357
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,079
should probably be working from the most

358
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,120
recent

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
versions i mean i find it puzzling for

360
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
instance that the authors spend so much

361
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,399
time talking about ergodicity

362
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,200
when the word ergotic doesn't

363
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,399
appear

364
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
or just just about never appears in the

365
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
particular physics monograph so anyway i

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
just find that there's a kind of

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
disconnect between what's presented here

368
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
and the actual work on the physics of

369
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,199
the free energy principle

370
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,800
that

371
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
that we have seen and uh

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,199
you know i think that leads to

373
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,519
several of the arguments uh being

374
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,800
proposed

375
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
uh being a bit um

376
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,639
missing their mark to put it

377
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
diplomatically

378
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,959
thank you for the concise summary

379
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
maxwell so steven with a raised hand and

380
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
then we'll continue

381
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,440
could i ask a little question as well

382
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
that relates to this is in the very

383
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
first

384
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
part of the abstract it talks about the

385
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,160
um

386
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
inevitable and emergent property of any

387
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
ergodic random dynamical system at

388
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,680
non-equilibrium steady state that

389
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
possesses a markov blanket so that's a

390
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,040
quote from the paper from 2013.

391
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
the thing is it says

392
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
before that according to the free energy

393
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
principle life is an

394
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,399
in and then it quotes inevitable and

395
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
emerging property which is the quote but

396
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,600
i'm not sure

397
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
that life is ever talked of as an

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,959
inevitable and emerging property of any

399
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
rand ergotic random dynamical system

400
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,639
in

401
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,160
terms of how it's referenced and i'm

402
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,279
wondering if there's a bit of a

403
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,920
confusion in the paper there where

404
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
um

405
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
it talks about this that quote

406
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
but makes it as if that's what life

407
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,160
that life is an emergent and an emergent

408
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
property and i think it's

409
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
um i think what we're talking about is

410
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,880
um

411
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,360
adaptive reduction of surprise

412
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
um or bayesian um inference

413
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
properties is an inevitable and emerging

414
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
property but i don't know if that would

415
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
be life but i don't know what your

416
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,279
thoughts are on that or whether i'm

417
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
misreading that

418
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
that reminds me of one of my favorite

419
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,920
papers what is life answering

420
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,639
schrodinger's question by maxwell at all

421
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
in 2018

422
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
um because

423
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
maybe you could even say something to

424
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,600
this what is the relationship between

425
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,399
reducing surprise and life

426
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
and do these recent technical

427
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,959
developments in fep

428
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,399
help bridge the gap between inanimate

429
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,680
and living

430
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,320
cognitive or computational processes and

431
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
where does physics play into that

432
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,160
that's that's very interesting i mean i

433
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
think the

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
the fep itself

435
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,199
uh

436
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,480
is not

437
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
a theory of life just in and of itself

438
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
right what is what it is

439
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
it's a theory to understand

440
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,880
uh

441
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
systems that are able to maintain

442
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
themselves in non-equilibrium regimes

443
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
effectively uh

444
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,160
so or i mean more precisely you know

445
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,120
stationary systems with a markov blanket

446
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
which is to say the same according to

447
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,519
the theory um

448
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
so i've gone on the record as saying

449
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
that the free energy principle can allow

450
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,480
us to construct

451
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
a theory of life

452
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
but the claim isn't just that the free

453
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
energy principle in and of itself

454
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,199
allows you to do that

455
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,800
i think you know

456
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,920
the fep needs to appeal to auxiliary

457
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,119
hypotheses from you know biological and

458
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
other sciences

459
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
to really do that i mean it's a theory

460
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
of thing-ness

461
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,240
in

462
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
physical systems

463
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
that interest us

464
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
and a subclass of those systems

465
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
are biological systems

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
um so i mean it is an aid in the

467
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
formulation

468
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
and probably the foundation of a

469
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
formulation of uh living systems so so

470
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
long as we agree that living systems are

471
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
a subclass of persisting systems and i

472
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
mean there's some talk in this paper

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,200
that maybe this persisters

474
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
living systems of persisters might not

475
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
be the right way to think about life but

476
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,600
yeah i think it acts as a foundation

477
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
i mean but then you need to add a lot

478
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
more

479
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,640
to turn that into a theory of life i

480
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,880
mean if you read my schrodinger paper

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
carefully for example what we propose is

482
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
a variational approach to neuropathology

483
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
uh we're not saying that

484
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
the free energy principle in and of

485
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
itself can just offer this like the free

486
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
energy principle has to use as it has to

487
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,320
be used as a foundation from which you

488
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
can build

489
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,320
these uh variational approaches to

490
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,679
neuroethology to niche construction to

491
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,080
ecology or what have you

492
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
um

493
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
so i mean but you know that that might

494
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
just be uh picking it nitpicking so like

495
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,240
i uh you know

496
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
well i don't want to double down on that

497
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
too much

498
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,960
it's

499
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,280
good points and it's almost

500
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
related to the definition or the

501
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,559
distinction between like a discipline

502
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,480
and a trans discipline

503
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,360
if

504
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,679
fep is a discipline versus if it's

505
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,440
connecting other disciplines variational

506
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
neuroethology it's right there in the

507
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
title we're connecting across different

508
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,200
areas

509
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
and the framework of thinkness

510
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,360
is one of those enabling features

511
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
that helps it be an integrative theory

512
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,559
but potentially it doesn't fulfill the

513
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
disciplinary

514
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,799
um uses

515
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,640
of theory so that's one interesting idea

516
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,679
um i guess there's many other

517
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,840
ways to go or things to ask i guess i'm

518
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,160
just i'm curious again like maxwell what

519
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
do you think in the last few years

520
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
how have we clarified or learned more

521
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,039
about where active inference and fep are

522
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
related to each other

523
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,440
so how was that thought of in

524
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
five years ago maybe when you were in

525
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
grad school

526
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
and then what do you think is sort of

527
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
contemporary greetings blue

528
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
in terms of the distinction between

529
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
active inference and fep and then

530
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,039
welcome blue and you can add anything

531
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,080
you'd like

532
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
and i know some people want to mark the

533
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
difference between the two i think

534
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,360
personally i think it's more of a

535
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
sociological thing

536
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,559
uh because

537
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
no one or of just about no one is

538
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
contesting the validity of active

539
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,840
inference models of cognitive

540
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
systems but there's a lot of pressure

541
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
from different circles on the free

542
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
energy formulation so i mean it might be

543
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
a sociological thing where it's just

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
easier to say oh i don't work on this

545
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
more you know

546
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
metaphysically sounding thing i just

547
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,559
work on computational neuroscience and

548
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
that's straightforward uh i think

549
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
there's no warrant for that from a

550
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,559
mathematical point of view you should

551
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,360
just

552
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
for example look at the way that things

553
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
are derived in the bayesian mechanics

554
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,080
paper

555
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,399
um

556
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
yeah i i feel like uh active inference

557
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,360
just falls out of

558
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,600
the the core bayesian mechanics

559
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
i mean i'd recommend everyone read

560
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,240
through that bayesian mechanics paper

561
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
it's really fantastic

562
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
it's very clear

563
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,559
one of the big differences between it

564
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,960
and its previous free energy papers is

565
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,679
that uh it's authored by

566
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
or at least there are two authors out of

567
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,240
the four on the paper who are proper

568
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
mathematicians working on you know the

569
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,840
mathematics of non-equilibrium

570
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,200
statistical mechanics effectively so uh

571
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,919
you know that paper really uh i think

572
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
meets the standards of rigor in

573
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
mathematics you know you have

574
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
an existence proof

575
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
for the synchronization manifold that's

576
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,720
sort of at the core of the whole formal

577
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
construct the thing that links internal

578
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
and external states

579
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
and then you have a construction of it i

580
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
mean it's very straightforward and

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
having having established

582
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
uh

583
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,120
you know the kind of core

584
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,159
formal

585
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
apparatus it's unfolding and by the end

586
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,720
you know you what you do is ask kind of

587
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,880
well all right let's split the blanket

588
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
states up into sensory and active states

589
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,039
and active inference just falls out of

590
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,320
you know

591
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,039
making the

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
active states subject to

593
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
the dynamics that those are unfolded

594
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
throughout the paper so in my view the

595
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
connection is immediate

596
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
um

597
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
yeah

598
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,440
uh i i i will grant that you know

599
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,240
they're

600
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
some of the computational models that

601
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
we're using are a bit more um

602
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
they look a lot more like just vanilla

603
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
you know computational neuroscience

604
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
models uh

605
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
you know their palm dps and stuff like

606
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,600
that but

607
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,640
but what the math that underwrites it

608
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
all is the math of the free energy

609
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
principle so i don't really

610
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,919
i don't really think the two can be

611
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,000
separated

612
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,320
thanks maxwell and um the basic

613
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
mechanics paper we discussed in

614
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
live stream number 26 so

615
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
it's um it is a lot to keep up with

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
sometimes but that was a very

617
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
fascinating discussion so blue and then

618
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
anyone else

619
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
i was wondering if that was bayesian

620
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
mechanics for stationary processes the

621
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
one we did yeah that's precisely it yeah

622
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,039
um so i sorry i'm late on the scene but

623
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,480
um i am curious about whether is the fep

624
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
a theory of life or does it allow us to

625
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,440
construct one and does it only apply to

626
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
life or can we take it in this kind of

627
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,320
pan psychic direction

628
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
um

629
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
where even molecules like want to

630
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
minimize their free energy and

631
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
self-assemble to become structures

632
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,159
that's a very good question um

633
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
i would say that the free energy

634
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,840
principle is not a metaphysics

635
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,400
um

636
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,200
so

637
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
it's it's a physics

638
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,679
so it's a formal framework

639
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,559
that

640
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,520
uh

641
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
may or may not give us

642
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
grip on the systems that we're

643
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
interested in

644
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
so i mean you know i and

645
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,679
i i know there is some philosophical

646
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,080
literature that presents it is more like

647
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
you know a metaphysical statement about

648
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,799
what life is

649
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,880
but i think it's more useful to think

650
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,279
about the bayesian mechanics as just an

651
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,919
extension of mechanics effectively you

652
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,799
know the

653
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
the same way that you know statistical

654
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,000
mechanics and quantum mechanics

655
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,880
are flavors of mechanics the bayesian

656
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
mechanics is also

657
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
you know and i realize that it you know

658
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
it's a little deflationary

659
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,360
uh it's a more instrumentalist reading

660
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
of the free energy principle but it's

661
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,520
not completely deflationary in the sense

662
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
that it the model says

663
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,159
that the best model

664
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
of livings and other existing systems is

665
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
as a model of their environment

666
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,559
so

667
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,520
you know

668
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,000
there's a kind of double instrumentalism

669
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,080
at play i think in in the free energy

670
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,399
stuff

671
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
to answer your question a bit more

672
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
directly i think it is it can be the fep

673
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
can be used to construct the theory of

674
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,760
life

675
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
in and of itself it's a theory of

676
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
thing-ness

677
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,840
um

678
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
but yeah it's a great set of questions

679
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
to discuss and i mean this is only my

680
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,640
view like i don't mean to

681
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
settle this once and for all there are

682
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,080
people who want to defend a more um

683
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
metaphysical

684
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
view on this

685
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
um i guess the question is

686
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,039
how far do you want to take the

687
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
commitments

688
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
uh of the free energy principle i mean

689
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,080
you know the there are kind of two

690
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,159
irreducible assumptions that go into the

691
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,640
math there's stationarity

692
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,559
which by the way is not the same as

693
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
ergodicity

694
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,200
so you know uh i think a whole section

695
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,279
of this argument just doesn't apply at

696
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,480
all anymore

697
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
the one presented by colombo and

698
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
palacios

699
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,799
and markov blankets

700
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,760
so i mean you know if if you think that

701
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
uh

702
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
you know systems that exist at some

703
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,679
scale have to be stationary

704
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
and you think that lit you know systems

705
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
that exist really do have a markov

706
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
blanket

707
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,279
then you can be realist about the

708
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,840
assumptions

709
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
but i kind of feel that it works whether

710
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,480
or not you take the additional

711
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,559
philosophical step of committing

712
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,679
hardcore

713
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,600
to the realist assumptions

714
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,559
uh

715
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,640
you know it works just

716
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,240
it works as an you know

717
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
an as if

718
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,159
theory if you will i mean the whole

719
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,200
thing tells you like living sorry uh

720
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
systems that uh

721
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
existed on the at non-equilibrium study

722
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
stated have and have a mark all blanket

723
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
will look as if

724
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,720
they're inferring

725
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
external states

726
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
and i mean um

727
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
yeah it i think this this looks as if

728
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,960
stuff is really

729
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,039
important

730
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
and i realized that you know for for

731
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
some of us it may be a little bit

732
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,039
deflationary uh

733
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,320
but i don't know if more is warranted

734
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
from the math i think that you know

735
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
there's a

736
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
yeah we just need to be kind of careful

737
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480
um

738
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,960
thanks for identifying those two key

739
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
pieces and maybe we'll have more to

740
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960
think about with the stationarity and

741
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
erodicity so blue with the raised hand

742
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,480
and then stephen

743
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,279
so just a couple things like when i say

744
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,960
pan psychicism i wasn't trying to go

745
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
into like the metaphysical realm but

746
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
because it's physics because it's not

747
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,919
metaphysics can it then apply to life

748
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,720
and non-life like can we just go all the

749
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,360
way down yeah and so in that kind of way

750
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,799
i wasn't really implying as a

751
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,919
metaphysical construct but more in like

752
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,399
the direct does it broadly apply to

753
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,120
non-life as well as life yeah and and

754
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,279
then also um just a couple more things

755
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,000
so

756
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
systems have a markov blanket like

757
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
maxwell that's you being entirely

758
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
realist

759
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,679
like i don't have a markup blanket but

760
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,440
can i be modeled with a markov blanket

761
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,919
probably um so so i don't i don't know

762
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,200
like you know i don't curl up in my

763
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
markov blanket at night when i go to bed

764
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
comfy

765
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,279
and then just lastly like going back to

766
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,240
the paper um this like so i don't know

767
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,679
that was one of the main questions that

768
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
i have for the authors is this concept

769
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
of they say like systems are in dynamic

770
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,360
equilibrium

771
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,399
like

772
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,960
i don't think that the non-equilibrium

773
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
steady state density is the same as

774
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,399
dynamic equilibrium at all and that was

775
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,360
one of the main questions that i raised

776
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,440
and like dynamic equilibrium really is

777
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
not it's a chemical process like of a

778
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
reversible chemical reaction so i i

779
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
don't i i really kind of missed that

780
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
that was one of the key things in the

781
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,880
paper that i just didn't understand at

782
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
all yeah i uh i mean i

783
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
i very much agree with you on the points

784
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
that you're saying

785
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,120
uh

786
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,440
the requests that you're raising here um

787
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
so i mean regarding the pan psychism

788
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,159
thing i mean yeah you can from physics

789
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,240
now kind of say that any system that

790
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
exists kind of looks as if it has a mind

791
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,039
uh you know then you might not want to

792
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,799
go full on

793
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,640
the metaphysics of pan psychism but it

794
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
certainly warrants that kind of claim i

795
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
mean in my view um

796
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
this paper is making uh a few critical

797
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,120
mistakes uh

798
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,440
and this is echoed a lot in

799
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,679
um you know a lot of the literature

800
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,440
coming from more like

801
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
four e people writing about this i'm

802
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
just gonna cite you know two sentences

803
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
from a paper pre-printed this year

804
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,880
uh i won't i won't name names but you'll

805
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
see the style of what i mean to be as

806
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
fair as possible we'll do this as in

807
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,840
criticize the fep by attending to the

808
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
more recent published versions and

809
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,840
variants of these claims and then the

810
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
next section starts literally the next

811
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
sentence the work presented in first in

812
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
2013

813
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
is central to practically all the

814
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,200
proposals comparing the fep

815
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
and in action and it just goes on and

816
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
stuff and it's

817
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,039
i i sort of feel like yeah the physics

818
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
foundation has moved forward like

819
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,159
you know blue you're pointing it out

820
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,159
it's all about non-equilibrium steady

821
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,520
states

822
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,559
and

823
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,480
non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics

824
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
and you know stationarity

825
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,840
that's importantly different from

826
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
ergodicity uh you know the one of the

827
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
nice things about the the bayesian

828
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,640
mechanics paper

829
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,600
is that it it abstracts away from

830
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
those assumptions i mean to be clear the

831
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
free energy principle at its core never

832
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,360
really required that the systems that

833
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,080
your study be ergotic

834
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
we assume an ergodic density in some of

835
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,159
the earlier publications because it

836
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,559
allows us to finesse one step in the

837
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,840
derivation

838
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
substituting

839
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,960
the time average for the ensemble

840
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,279
average and one of the really core

841
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,440
derivations

842
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
but you know as uh carl himself had been

843
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
pointing out for a long time

844
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,600
you could finesse the math into you know

845
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,279
something else like there's no reason

846
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,120
why you have to stick with

847
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
the ergodic assumption it was used to

848
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,240
finesse

849
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
one step of the derivation

850
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,320
and you know what lance de costa

851
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,000
and a

852
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
company have done in this bayesian

853
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,519
mechanics paper with carlos precisely to

854
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
do the laborious work

855
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
of actually generalizing

856
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,039
the math to

857
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,919
non-ergotic systems so i mean i think

858
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,720
that's really important the bayesian

859
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,679
mechanics paper um

860
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,200
and you know we're in discussions with

861
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,039
the people active discussions of the

862
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,399
people who've produced the critical

863
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,080
material and i mean at this point i

864
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,760
think everyone

865
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
essentially agrees that lance's new

866
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,000
derivations respond to

867
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
uh

868
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
you know the the critiques by aguirre

869
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,120
and

870
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
colleagues that came out earlier this

871
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,519
year

872
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
and also the beel at all critique

873
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,919
remember the the core of the beel at all

874
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,080
critique is that uh

875
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,480
for ou processes

876
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,799
in general

877
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,960
of the sort that carl was using you

878
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,600
can't assume that

879
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,519
the synchronization manifold will exist

880
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,240
between internal and external states

881
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,159
in fact what martin and company have

882
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,320
showed is the for a generic ou process

883
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,039
you can't just you it does not exist

884
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
um but you know that

885
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,679
that doesn't mean that you can't find

886
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,360
very broad conditions under which the

887
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,120
synchronization manifold exists and

888
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,240
that's what

889
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,919
lance and company have done in this new

890
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,960
paper

891
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,320
uh

892
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,880
aguirre's critique aguero at all this is

893
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
the sussex group also did a very

894
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
interesting analysis of the math as it

895
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
figured in the uh

896
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,279
particular physics paper

897
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,559
uh

898
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,559
you know showing that actually the the

899
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,799
precise assumptions that carl uses in

900
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,399
the paper would restrict the scope of

901
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,480
the fep to a rather narrow class of

902
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
systems but again lance just rederived

903
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
all of the equations so the formalism is

904
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,960
now effectively different and what you

905
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
can really see from the math is that it

906
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,399
applies to

907
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
non-linear systems and to non-ergodic

908
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,039
systems

909
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,760
and this leads me to another point um i

910
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,519
think the the the assumption of

911
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
non-equilibrium steady state is often

912
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
not understood in the way that it should

913
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,000
so non-equilibrium steady state is a

914
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
characterization of the density dynamics

915
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
it is not a characterization of the

916
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
system itself if i if i say that a

917
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,159
system is at non-equilibrium steady

918
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,440
state i'm not saying that it is steadily

919
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
in some

920
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,880
state you know that it just that it

921
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
occupied what i'm saying

922
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,600
is that the the probability landscape

923
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,679
that underwrites its dynamics is

924
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,279
stationary

925
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
or has stopped evolving

926
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,239
um those are two very very very

927
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,800
different claims so it doesn't follow

928
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
from the fact that a system has a nest

929
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
density that it is history-less it

930
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,839
doesn't follow from

931
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,719
uh

932
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,599
you know the the existence of the next

933
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,560
density that uh there should only be one

934
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
attractor like you can have

935
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,679
metastability

936
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,679
in an fep system you can have

937
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,719
non-linearity in an fep system you can

938
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,639
have non-ergodicity

939
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,480
in an fep system

940
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
um

941
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,960
so

942
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,879
yeah i mean i i think

943
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,000
you know

944
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that means you know that one of the

945
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
three

946
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
sections the critical sections in this

947
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
paper are just completely off the mark

948
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,359
and you know

949
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,320
there's this new paper

950
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,918
by some of the tenors of the inactive

951
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,960
approach

952
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,280
on precisely this kind of stuff as well

953
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
and

954
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,839
unfortunately the same mistakes are made

955
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
um you know ergodicity in in the context

956
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
of the fep

957
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,440
uh

958
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,480
i mean really just means that the the

959
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
the quantities that you're uh

960
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,599
observing or measurable

961
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,160
um it means that you know all the

962
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,119
average of your measures converges

963
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,119
on average to a measure

964
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,720
of the average

965
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,079
you know or of the mean that you're

966
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,160
actually trying to

967
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,880
calculate in a heuristic sense

968
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,200
so it never meant that

969
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,280
systems don't have a history it never

970
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,359
meant that systems necessarily converge

971
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
on one attracting

972
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
set

973
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
and so i i really feel that that kind of

974
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,359
takes the teeth out of

975
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,079
most of the you know formal criticism in

976
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,440
this paper uh the other part of the the

977
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,359
other critical parts of this paper talk

978
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,800
about you know the challenges of

979
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
modeling

980
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,920
biological systems using state spaces

981
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,359
but that

982
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,520
those sections to me don't amount to

983
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,240
much more than just saying it would be

984
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,040
very difficult to do this

985
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,400
um

986
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,160
therefore

987
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
it's not doable or something like that

988
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
and you know i i i have a lot of friends

989
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
who are computational biologists and i

990
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,480
speak to a lot of people doing this and

991
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,079
it's sort of like well

992
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,400
you know some work would have to be done

993
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
to write a paper to respond to this but

994
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,480
you know what's the expression one

995
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,960
person's uh modus tollens is another

996
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,680
person's modest modus ponens or

997
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
like you know i sort of feel like all

998
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
right well you know you say this is

999
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,119
impossible uh i know that formally you

1000
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,680
know alex alec chan's

1001
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,400
is a really cool guy and uh

1002
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
he's brilliant he and the sussex team uh

1003
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,520
have recently

1004
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,359
recently i mean this is two years old so

1005
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,520
it's not that recently and i feel like

1006
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
this should be

1007
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,040
accounted for in this paper but have

1008
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,079
recently automated uh state-space

1009
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,359
construction

1010
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
um in the free energy framework like we

1011
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
have active inference models now that

1012
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,640
can kind of automatically assemble

1013
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,520
and can handle up to it's either 10 000

1014
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
or a million

1015
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,880
states

1016
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
so you know

1017
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,920
that's a lot of modeling power and i i

1018
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,839
find the example that they discuss in a

1019
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,280
footnote there

1020
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,320
uh you know however this is on page 11

1021
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
however the size of the genotype space

1022
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,119
for a protein consisting of n residues

1023
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,200
chosen from an alphabet of amino acids

1024
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,320
the size m is m to the n and then they

1025
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,640
say oh well you know it's like 20 to the

1026
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,920
100 or 10 to the 130 possible

1027
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,079
uh states if you wanted to model like

1028
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,800
you know amino acids what they're not

1029
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,720
considering is the nested formulation

1030
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,200
and i i kind of feel like nested nest

1031
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,280
densities should have been at the core

1032
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,160
of this argument and figure nowhere

1033
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,240
uh yeah i mean of course if you think

1034
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,640
that you can just plot all of the states

1035
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,320
of the system across all the scales at

1036
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
which it exists in one you know

1037
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
homogeneous state space you're going to

1038
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,760
run into a problem but you're not if you

1039
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
carefully construct these state spaces

1040
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
in a kind of nested fashion um you know

1041
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,400
like a friend of mine van the tower

1042
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
uh works on

1043
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
i pulled this paper up he has a

1044
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
really cool pre-print a deep learning

1045
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
approach to capture the essence of

1046
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,920
candida albicans morphologies

1047
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
and i mean basically there what they do

1048
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,240
is start with a population of candida

1049
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,839
which is a fungus for those of you who

1050
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,119
don't know

1051
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,839
and then you you randomly generate a

1052
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,920
crispr and you introduce it into the

1053
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,599
population and you see how the

1054
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,880
population

1055
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,079
develops

1056
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,480
and you plot each populational

1057
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,160
trajectory in a 30 000 parameter

1058
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,880
hyperparameter space

1059
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
effectively and you see

1060
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
the way that like the candida

1061
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
self-organize into pockets depending on

1062
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,040
their you know the kind of crispers that

1063
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,200
you put into them uh

1064
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
i mean this is not like fringe work this

1065
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
is just routine computational biology

1066
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
where we're already you know plotting

1067
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,760
phenotypic expression in 30 000

1068
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
dimensional

1069
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
spaces

1070
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,800
uh you know

1071
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,599
this isn't like forthcoming

1072
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,800
work to be done i mean it's really just

1073
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,119
standard work it's interesting how

1074
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,119
you know i i think they they modified

1075
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,440
the paper we had discussed this in a

1076
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
live stream before and they

1077
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,240
they

1078
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,000
nicely added some uh responses to some

1079
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of the criticisms that i i raised in

1080
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,359
discussion

1081
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
um

1082
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,880
i'd have to

1083
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,720
pull it out but you know i i said well

1084
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,480
you know that we're using this stuff in

1085
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,560
studies of uh cancer dynamics and you

1086
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,480
know like so uh i i wrote in a paper you

1087
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
know

1088
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,400
we can think of a biological system's

1089
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
extended phenotype as the set of

1090
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,280
extracting

1091
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,520
attracting states of a coupled dynamical

1092
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
system and this is supported by studies

1093
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,839
of cancer genesis and propagation

1094
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,160
uh i can link the papers

1095
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,560
and you know they say well you know

1096
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
these studies provide evidence that

1097
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
cancer can be fruitfully modeled and

1098
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,359
understood as an attractor in a

1099
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,440
dynamical system but they don't provide

1100
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,280
us with evidence that all biological

1101
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
systems occupy an attractor and i'm sort

1102
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,480
of thinking like

1103
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
well

1104
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,440
no but it you know this is a counter

1105
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,800
example to you're saying that it's not

1106
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,440
doable in a real biological system you

1107
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,640
know uh so i you know if i if i'm being

1108
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,720
snarky i feel like this is armchair

1109
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
biology of the worst kind

1110
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
kind of you're telling me that what i'm

1111
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,960
doing is impossible while i'm doing it

1112
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,240
and

1113
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,280
you know

1114
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,359
and you're doing it by appealing to like

1115
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,760
you know an old conception

1116
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,200
of the physics

1117
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,160
uh by talking about assumptions that

1118
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,480
aren't even part of the

1119
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,760
formalism anymore i mean i i just uh i

1120
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,079
find that there's a lot to object to in

1121
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,760
this paper both in terms of the

1122
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
substance and in terms of the general

1123
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
kind of strategy of kind of gotcha in

1124
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,200
uh

1125
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,079
now

1126
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,599
does the free energy principle need to

1127
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,160
be discussed critically absolutely and

1128
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
you know i i should have caveated all

1129
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,000
this by saying that some of the most

1130
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,160
interesting and stimulating uh

1131
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,920
intellectual exchanges that i've had in

1132
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,240
my life have been with you know the

1133
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,359
people

1134
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,480
creating

1135
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,040
critical material uh

1136
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
but you know

1137
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,359
the the people that are generating this

1138
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,280
interesting critical material are

1139
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,440
actually engaging with

1140
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,480
the theory at its formal core

1141
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,280
and

1142
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,440
you know i i sort of feel like some of

1143
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
these things would have just been

1144
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,200
cleared up with

1145
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,040
you know a few conversations and looking

1146
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,319
at the

1147
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,400
more recent material but

1148
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,640
now i feel like i'm just kvetching

1149
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
at this point

1150
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,760
thank you maxwell that's what these

1151
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,359
discussions are

1152
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,520
for and hopefully bringing into the open

1153
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
it's just a multi-perspective

1154
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,520
scenario

1155
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,839
to give you like a specific idea why

1156
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,880
this is problematic like if if you focus

1157
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,200
on ergodicity and not on the nested nest

1158
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
densities then you're going to say

1159
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,760
things like well first you have to show

1160
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,599
that there's an attractor and then you

1161
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,760
have to show that the relaxation time is

1162
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
biologically plausible and they claim

1163
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
that neither of these things are done in

1164
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,520
the free energy literature when

1165
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,560
literally

1166
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,440
you know the core 40 50 pages of carl's

1167
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,839
physics monograph deal with and you know

1168
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,480
dan uh i i i know you we've we've read

1169
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
it all together during the last year

1170
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,240
like

1171
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,560
i i don't know how you how they could

1172
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
have missed this i mean it's it's the

1173
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,200
physics monograph this is supposed to be

1174
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,280
their topic the core of the physics

1175
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,599
monograph is all about you know uh

1176
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,440
information length

1177
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,160
uh effectively right and relaxation

1178
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,240
times back to non-equilibrium

1179
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,640
steady-state and how all these things

1180
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
kind of work in a nested way to get you

1181
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,599
biological dynamics so it seems to me

1182
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,440
like they are just completely missing

1183
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,720
their target

1184
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,680
but both by you know working out

1185
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,560
on

1186
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,839
on formulations that are out of date and

1187
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,680
that introduce assumptions that are no

1188
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,040
longer at play

1189
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,960
and and also by just really ignoring

1190
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,560
you know

1191
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,319
the physics stuff the free energy

1192
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,000
physics stuff that they claim to be

1193
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,560
criticizing uh

1194
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,760
you know

1195
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,920
so

1196
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,720
we need to be um just like if we were

1197
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
going to catch a baseball we need to be

1198
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,680
performing anticipatory

1199
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
knowledge work not merely reactive

1200
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,880
especially to previous uh formats and

1201
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,800
then or if it's reactive i mean you know

1202
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
react to the recent stuff i mean you

1203
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,240
know there's been a concerted effort

1204
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,200
to

1205
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
ground this

1206
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,520
in the physics of non-equilibrium

1207
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,760
systems like non-equilibrium statistical

1208
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,280
mechanics information geometry i mean

1209
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,640
if you're going to be writing a

1210
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
criticism of that stuff

1211
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,000
then you should probably be writing

1212
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,720
about that stuff is sort of my point

1213
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
and you know and by the way this often

1214
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
goes really badly when i point out that

1215
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,760
hey you know you're working from a

1216
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,599
you know an outdated

1217
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,200
thing they say oh you know

1218
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,520
the free energy version 25 from this

1219
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,280
morning and blah blah but i kind of feel

1220
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,400
like you know

1221
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,480
my friend if you want to write a

1222
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
criticism of something

1223
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,880
like you should be as charitable as

1224
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
possible with the target of your

1225
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
criticism on the one hand and you should

1226
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
definitely not be working

1227
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,160
on versions of this that no one in the

1228
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
core community is still working on and

1229
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,520
there is a dimension of like if you

1230
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,599
can't keep up then i don't know you know

1231
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,520
i don't know who benefits from this it's

1232
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,280
sort of like my

1233
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,480
my

1234
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,680
questioning it's like

1235
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,400
okay so steven and then blue

1236
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,240
yeah i think

1237
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
thanks for the giving us a good good

1238
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,880
insight there i i think the the site the

1239
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
sociological psychological piece

1240
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,319
is is present in all of this as you say

1241
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,240
and i think i've mentioned this before

1242
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,160
to you maxwell actually is the

1243
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,400
the danger of systems talking about

1244
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,839
systems i think even if you were talking

1245
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,200
to people in the international society

1246
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,760
of system sciences they often talk about

1247
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,920
systems system dynamics

1248
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,839
and everything else things complex

1249
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,520
systems kind of gets lumped into

1250
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,160
complexity right so there's a danger

1251
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,599
because i don't think

1252
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,440
carl necessarily would say fep system

1253
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,000
right and that term system i think gets

1254
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,160
you into a lot of challenges because the

1255
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
folk psychology of what a system is is

1256
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,480
what we see it as from the outside

1257
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,960
and you know these non-equilibrium

1258
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,800
steady states i'm wondering whether we

1259
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,880
say mark he says blankets all the way up

1260
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,000
and down

1261
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
but i'm i'm not sure if it's more like

1262
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,680
thing this all the way up and down is

1263
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
safer than systems all the way up and

1264
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
down because

1265
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,119
things can have all sorts of you know

1266
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,800
and they can have states and they can be

1267
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,000
what they are

1268
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,960
and the question really becomes then

1269
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,119
within all that ergodicity which unlike

1270
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,880
physics which tends to be about getting

1271
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,960
things to a certain number of decimal

1272
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
points of accuracy jen

1273
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,640
it's a messy thing you know i was

1274
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,359
talking about that thing about

1275
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,000
approximation science i mean again that

1276
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,079
gets your head around what that that

1277
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,560
makes suddenly you got well the main

1278
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,880
thing is you just need enough

1279
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,160
of whatever this stationary

1280
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,319
extractable

1281
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,800
data is to be able to do something with

1282
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,280
it and i'm kind of thinking that maybe

1283
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,960
because it in the same way that in

1284
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,440
chemistry if you have a beaker

1285
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,920
and you you stir it up

1286
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,480
and basically the thing will have its

1287
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,640
dynamics it will move

1288
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,240
based on the energy between the

1289
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,880
different things and basically entropy

1290
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,440
is just basically the

1291
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,520
the force that's pushing it in the way

1292
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,800
that you don't expect it to it's

1293
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,839
basically

1294
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,599
you know we know it does this from this

1295
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,200
equilibrium state we knows that and

1296
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,880
entropy is just the

1297
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,240
thing in the middle now no one has a

1298
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,880
bloody clue what's why

1299
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,800
that's just a black box right now but

1300
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,000
that's because they're going from now

1301
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,800
when you go to these

1302
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,599
non-equilibrium

1303
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,240
far from equilibrium chemistry state and

1304
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,839
they're held

1305
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,760
which you you don't do when you mix up a

1306
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,200
beaker and just go from a to b now we

1307
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,559
don't know how many

1308
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,800
non-equilibrium states

1309
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,040
these reactions go through to be honest

1310
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,960
in those cases now

1311
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,640
but you wouldn't call the beaker a

1312
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,160
system you call it

1313
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,720
a solution you'd call it a you know you

1314
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,200
might call the vessel and the chemical

1315
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,839
plant in which it reacts a system but

1316
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
you just sort it kind of a beaker of

1317
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,400
stuff or things that's doing stuff and

1318
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,920
things right and you sort of see what it

1319
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,160
does and then it's like what can we do

1320
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,680
that's useful

1321
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,440
and normally what's useful is what

1322
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,760
energy shifts but in this case you've

1323
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,480
also saying the entropy can be useful

1324
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,000
but not in the way most people would

1325
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,160
the what we could say the folk systems

1326
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,440
thinkers

1327
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,079
would kind of tend to think about it so

1328
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,400
i'm just wondering if there's a danger

1329
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,200
of

1330
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
using the word system

1331
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,839
yeah i i would agree i mean uh

1332
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,680
i think we use the term system just

1333
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,480
because uh you know all of this grows

1334
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,119
out of dynamic systems theory in some

1335
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,000
sense

1336
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,520
uh you know

1337
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,599
carl talks with particles

1338
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,520
right like uh

1339
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,800
a a system with a markov blanket

1340
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
and does the free energy stuff is a

1341
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,920
particle in his account um so that yeah

1342
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,480
there is a uh

1343
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,200
so there's a there's a linguistic

1344
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,800
danger here because i agree with you

1345
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,319
this is not what people think of when

1346
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,400
they hear the word system a lot of our

1347
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
exchanges as you pointed out stephen

1348
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,200
have turned around that specific point i

1349
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
think the the term is important because

1350
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,960
especially in the context of relating

1351
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,680
the fep to like the four e approaches

1352
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,960
i think it's not

1353
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
appreciated sufficiently

1354
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,440
that the fep math is what happens if you

1355
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,800
take dynamical systems theory seriously

1356
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,599
um you know so when i was doing my

1357
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,480
undergrad i was reading the four e guys

1358
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,280
and

1359
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
the fourier people

1360
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,079
because it's not just guys

1361
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:36,880
and

1362
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,720
uh yeah the the fourier people were

1363
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,240
telling me all right well you know

1364
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,400
computer theory you only get so far in

1365
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,240
the study of cognition you have to do

1366
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
dynamical systems

1367
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,280
learn dst math and learn the physics of

1368
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,839
complex systems so i did

1369
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,520
and several of us did

1370
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,920
but what happens is then if you continue

1371
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,599
asking questions along that direction

1372
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,280
things arise like well how do you

1373
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,000
measure distances between states

1374
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,440
and if you start asking that kind of

1375
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,599
question inevitably

1376
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,400
information and entropy creep back into

1377
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
the picture

1378
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,680
because that's how you measure distances

1379
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,640
between

1380
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,240
states effectively

1381
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
is in gnats

1382
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,640
and other information theoretic units so

1383
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,119
i mean this is to me the great irony of

1384
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,359
this whole you know fpp versus an

1385
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,280
activism confrontation which is slowly

1386
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,119
turning into like one of the big

1387
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,040
discussions in contemporary philosophy

1388
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,280
is i don't think that the

1389
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,079
fourie people fully appreciate that the

1390
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,079
fep stuff is just a prolongation of

1391
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,400
their thinking style that if you

1392
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,359
if you really want to take seriously the

1393
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,400
core tenets of embodied cognition then

1394
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,559
inevitably you are led back to

1395
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,319
information

1396
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,920
there's no escape

1397
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,240
it's really if you want to take their

1398
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
own framework seriously

1399
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,480
there's no other place to go but here i

1400
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,040
unfortunately have to uh leave now thank

1401
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,520
you maxwell thank you for listening to

1402
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,680
me rant about this i'll try to be there

1403
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,359
next week um and yeah i mean uh keep

1404
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,680
kicking ass i mean dan blue

1405
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,800
uh i i just love active inference lab

1406
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,119
and i'm so grateful for the awesome work

1407
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,680
that you do keeping this community alive

1408
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,760
stephen it's always a pleasure to talk

1409
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,920
with you and i'm glad to see that you

1410
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,280
know there's uh so much uh

1411
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
so much like yeah you're just there all

1412
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,200
the time and i just love your uh you

1413
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,079
know your

1414
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,319
your contributions to the conversation

1415
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,000
it's always a pleasure to talk to you so

1416
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,559
a big love to everyone uh

1417
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,839
and i will be uh in touch shortly uh

1418
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,240
apologies for the snarkiness it's just

1419
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,440
you know

1420
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,880
this is the kind of paper that really

1421
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,119
grinds my gear

1422
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,440
i thought it was it was uh good to just

1423
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,200
point out a few of what i i think are

1424
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,720
the issues

1425
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,079
thank you maxwell see you soon

1426
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,160
goodbye

1427
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,480
this uh blue will go to you but this is

1428
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,920
uh you know it's a key difference

1429
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,760
between being an organizer and a

1430
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,160
facilitator or a participant

1431
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,960
um

1432
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,839
we're

1433
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
here to help scaffold

1434
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,160
individuals to participate and their

1435
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,680
perspectives

1436
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,920
and uh that's the second order

1437
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,319
cybernetics so things will get more

1438
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,680
contentious

1439
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
than we can even imagine

1440
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
and someone just has to hold down the

1441
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,599
broadcasting

1442
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
make sure that hands are being raised

1443
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,520
and that protocol is being respected

1444
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,079
because there are serious first level

1445
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,839
questions to resolve

1446
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,400
but we can have precision in our second

1447
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,880
level policy and that's gonna return to

1448
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,240
a question in the live chat but first

1449
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,520
blue with a raised hand thank you

1450
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,240
so i just wanted to um you know say that

1451
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,960
a lot of what both maxwell was saying

1452
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,599
and um what stephen said just really

1453
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,839
underscores the need for

1454
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,920
consistent definitions like how do we

1455
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,800
define a system and also like a

1456
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,839
consistent synthesis of the fep like

1457
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,280
historically

1458
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,599
where did it start where has it been

1459
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,280
where is it going

1460
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,119
and like what where are the landmarks

1461
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,040
like for example this basin

1462
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,960
bayesian mechanics for stationary

1463
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,280
processes paper you know has revamped

1464
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,079
the math and physics and when we're

1465
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,280
making a new paper or a new argument are

1466
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,800
we working with

1467
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,160
the current version of the model

1468
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,520
absolutely nice uh foreshadowing of some

1469
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,200
work that we're involved in but if

1470
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,599
anyone is interested in sort of

1471
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,079
scholarship and a history from an

1472
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,400
empirical perspective

1473
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
on fep and active they should get in

1474
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
touch with blue or i because this is a

1475
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,079
project that we're super keen on

1476
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,000
but it's a very important point and

1477
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,079
that's why in our dot zero we had like

1478
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,359
this slide

1479
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,440
with um the active inference lab the

1480
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
working ontology so we're going in a

1481
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,040
participatory way

1482
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,720
and we're working through these terms

1483
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,640
and we're finding where it's quoted in

1484
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,319
the literature how it's used in the

1485
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,359
literature

1486
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,280
and then we're adding notes and relevant

1487
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,839
resources and we'll be developing

1488
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,119
curriculum

1489
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,800
that helps make simple declarative uses

1490
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,920
of these terms so that we don't get lost

1491
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,839
and we'll have the terms and we'll have

1492
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,000
the specifics of literature and it'll be

1493
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,079
an awesome environment for learning

1494
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,079
applying and communicating active

1495
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,800
inference so before um stephen you want

1496
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,760
to go with a question and then we'll go

1497
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,680
to the live chat

1498
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
well i just add to that point you just

1499
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,599
made is i think

1500
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,119
it is really going to be important

1501
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,960
because we're seeing the confusions that

1502
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,520
can happen but also it's it's likely

1503
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,200
that there's going to be

1504
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
a kind of a multi ontology

1505
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,280
there might be something

1506
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,480
in this whole field that um speaks to

1507
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,839
how this changes just in the way that

1508
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:54,880
um

1509
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,599
carl fristen talks about when something

1510
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
is regimes to an infomax

1511
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,599
focus versus a hamilton

1512
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,960
lease action focus versus uh you know

1513
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,440
a reward

1514
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,040
focus so

1515
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,720
there may well be

1516
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,599
um

1517
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,559
this commonality and there may also be

1518
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,440
a way to process

1519
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,119
when things

1520
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,720
systems

1521
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,440
particles

1522
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,559
become

1523
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,599
you know derivations and you know that's

1524
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,960
going to be interesting because there

1525
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,880
may be some nexus

1526
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,480
whether it's called metaphysics or

1527
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,720
whether it's it's something more

1528
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,680
prof

1529
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,599
you know less less out there maybe it

1530
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,079
can be grounded and i think that that's

1531
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,720
starting to come up as we we hit

1532
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,400
you know that's transdisciplinarity for

1533
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,160
you right it's gonna you're gonna want

1534
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,559
to know what's in the discipline piece

1535
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,960
so maybe there will be stuff which is

1536
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,359
kind of grounded in the biology world

1537
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,960
and grounded in the physics world and is

1538
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,920
going to talk

1539
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,880
as best it can their language right and

1540
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,559
then there's going to be stuff which is

1541
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,960
in the applied world which ultimately

1542
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,799
starts to go transdisciplinary at some

1543
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,040
point as soon as you get out and get to

1544
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,799
any sort of scale

1545
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:11,920
um

1546
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,839
so i think that's going to be very very

1547
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,119
interesting awesome and both steven and

1548
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,480
blue and many others join us weekly in

1549
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,599
edu

1550
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,200
where we talk about this so let me read

1551
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,280
a few of the awesome comments from the

1552
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,799
live chat and ask a question from the

1553
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,119
live chat and anyone else can continue

1554
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,559
to ask a question

1555
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,799
so there's a lot of discussion on the

1556
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:33,920
systems

1557
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,079
question and yvonne

1558
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,559
said maxwell subscribe to our

1559
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,440
systems thinking course we will discuss

1560
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,280
what a system is from the standpoint of

1561
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,200
systems engineering so that's really

1562
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
important thanks yvonne for sharing that

1563
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,119
and indeed two of the fundamental

1564
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,280
pillars or ontologies or trans

1565
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,319
disciplines of active inference lab are

1566
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,359
active inference and systems engineering

1567
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,119
so those are the perspectives that we

1568
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,280
draw on and seek synthesis and

1569
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,720
application of

1570
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,440
and we're all learning a lot and it will

1571
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,040
be updating our generative model in a

1572
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,760
way that changes our policy selection to

1573
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,720
be able to use words like system without

1574
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,119
going down the philosophy rabbit hole

1575
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,599
every time and just having a way that we

1576
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,319
can talk about systems of interest like

1577
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,040
in dot coms our system of interest is

1578
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,960
the live stream so how do we take a

1579
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
role-based approach that embodies the

1580
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,440
best of our values

1581
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,920
and uses the term system and we also get

1582
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920
all these other pieces too so

1583
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,040
good um thanks for sharing that yvonne

1584
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,920
dave shared a lot of interesting

1585
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,079
information about life and about some of

1586
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,559
the history of a few different ideas

1587
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,559
related to conceptualizations of life

1588
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,559
but the question that i wanted to get to

1589
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,480
was from michael nyc who wrote

1590
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,960
how would you model this conversation

1591
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,480
using this model

1592
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,119
so that's a question we can uh think

1593
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,680
about and i it speaks to almost like

1594
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,079
applying because online teams are

1595
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,440
certainly an application that's

1596
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,640
important for different kinds of

1597
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,839
modeling

1598
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,960
and i'll give a first thought on this so

1599
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,880
one thing is when you said how do we

1600
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,000
model it

1601
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,760
the question is beautifully phrased

1602
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,200
because it doesn't say well what does

1603
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,480
the theory say that this conversation is

1604
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,720
that's setting up for an absolute

1605
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,599
hegemonic realist answer

1606
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,319
how would you model it

1607
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,559
is going to be inherently

1608
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,240
different perspectives because different

1609
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,559
individuals and different years are

1610
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,160
going to have access to different tools

1611
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,400
and ideas and people so they're going to

1612
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,200
model this conversation differently so

1613
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,280
that's the first piece and that's moving

1614
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,040
from that sort of absolutist modest

1615
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,079
realism

1616
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,040
into

1617
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,200
more of a multi-perspectival

1618
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,240
system

1619
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,040
now

1620
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,839
what are some ways that one could model

1621
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,640
this

1622
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,559
there could be a cyber physical

1623
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,280
depiction where one is very interested

1624
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,240
as we were in our 2020 voyatkin at all

1625
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,440
paper

1626
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,240
in the information flows from a

1627
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,440
computational perspective like sense is

1628
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,599
the incoming states and actions are the

1629
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,760
outcoming states so in the context of a

1630
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,359
video conversation

1631
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,520
there's an audio visual feed in and

1632
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,920
there's an audio visual going out

1633
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,680
so we could use blankets and interfaces

1634
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,839
and sense and action states

1635
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,280
to talk about

1636
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,079
just the cyber physical dimensions of

1637
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,599
the conversation

1638
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,520
another approach would be the

1639
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,640
hermeneutic or computational

1640
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,280
conversationalist approach which dave

1641
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,359
has connected back to

1642
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,720
a long lineage of work related to

1643
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,520
1970s conversation theory and he wrote

1644
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,760
it provides a micro theory for nested

1645
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,000
mutual models focusing on the evolution

1646
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,160
and incorporation or rejection of

1647
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,079
predicates and their syntactic

1648
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,200
occurrence

1649
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,799
active inference work provides a

1650
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,680
corresponding needed macro theory

1651
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,520
focusing on secular evolution of the

1652
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,960
interchanges

1653
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,680
so one could have a communication

1654
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,160
oriented model that focuses on the

1655
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,280
semantics of the conversation

1656
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,000
one could make also as discussed that

1657
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,839
kind of a cyber physical very

1658
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,359
computational model

1659
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,280
and there's other types of models that

1660
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,040
can be made and then there's a million

1661
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,359
different implementations so that's just

1662
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,200
the first pass but it's a really

1663
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,440
important question and it helps us

1664
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,640
connect

1665
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,359
the abstractions and the framework to

1666
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,599
the minute particulars which are the

1667
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,240
system specific realizations

1668
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,559
that ground us in transdisciplinarity

1669
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,200
and application so stephen and then any

1670
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,880
other questions from the live chat or

1671
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,040
blue

1672
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,480
yeah i think they're quite useful

1673
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,480
questions those because they're

1674
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,200
that question about how can i um i mean

1675
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,520
it ties into a couple of things

1676
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,280
my first interest would be say okay why

1677
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,200
would i so there's some but the other

1678
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,000
thing is how can i i how can i

1679
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
implicitly also

1680
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,760
link to

1681
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,359
is available to me

1682
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,000
what information is it

1683
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,280
possible

1684
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,599
to interact with you know that idea of

1685
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,480
this

1686
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,880
so we can bring in we

1687
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,839
this modeling process sort of ties us in

1688
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,280
this sort of mid ground between

1689
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,040
how we actually want to talk about all

1690
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,160
of this which i think is where the um

1691
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,680
systems engineering is really useful

1692
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,119
because ultimately you kind of have to

1693
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,720
bring it into a system of

1694
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,240
externalize knowledge which can be then

1695
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,400
communicated and moved around as in the

1696
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,640
papers and other things that

1697
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,839
can be done

1698
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,760
but it's also how can you start to

1699
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,599
understand say

1700
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,520
the process is going on in the moment so

1701
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,400
it could be measuring what we're doing

1702
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,559
in this real time process and someone

1703
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,319
tracking that it could be a case of

1704
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,400
video in it and watching back the video

1705
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,640
with an interpretation thereof it could

1706
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,880
also be you know if we were wearing

1707
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,440
sensors you know they could be just

1708
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,079
trying to model the dynamics of us as

1709
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,480
things you know there's a just trying to

1710
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,599
say

1711
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,680
how could i know

1712
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,480
what i can even trying to

1713
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,880
feed into a system so i mean that one of

1714
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,480
the classic cases that's recently there

1715
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,839
with ryan smith

1716
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,079
their work on interception they had to

1717
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,359
devise

1718
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,240
a method for recording

1719
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,520
first they did it with the heart and

1720
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,720
they changed the way the heart was

1721
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,680
measured but they also did some

1722
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,520
recordings of the stomach and the

1723
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,720
stomach region

1724
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,920
they had to find a way to get data

1725
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,240
to find out what could then be modeled

1726
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,039
and

1727
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,799
was that a system they were modeling or

1728
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,960
was it almost the dynamics they were

1729
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,359
modeling and of the things you know and

1730
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,839
i think that's i think and just seeing

1731
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,559
how all the dynamics change over time

1732
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,880
and i think this is this is where maybe

1733
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,920
there's a lot of challenges um that's

1734
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,079
going to be faced because we've had this

1735
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,640
conversation in this modeling world is

1736
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,760
you know

1737
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,400
jumping things into a system engineering

1738
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,160
world which isn't

1739
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,559
only a non-equilibrium philosophical

1740
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,720
world it's quite useful for applied work

1741
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,039
because it does that ability to make

1742
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,640
something a system

1743
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,880
in a way that's intentionally that and

1744
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,400
it has system of interest just like

1745
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,839
daniel was saying

1746
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,520
and then you've got

1747
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,760
but within that our system of interest

1748
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,720
is about going beyond

1749
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,599
the systems of obvious

1750
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,760
presentation you know there's stuff

1751
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,880
going on

1752
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,400
under the hood

1753
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,680
which is not necessarily um

1754
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,640
intuitively available at all so i don't

1755
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,920
know what your thoughts on that daniel

1756
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,520
but i think it's interesting

1757
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,960
yeah the only short thing i'd say is

1758
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
like even if the system of interest for

1759
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,599
example is the mind of someone being

1760
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,079
educated for example in the curriculum

1761
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,480
of active inference lab or the audience

1762
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,079
who we're speaking to is our system of

1763
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,440
interest

1764
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,359
or even live stream

1765
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,440
having your system of interest be the

1766
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,920
learner's mind or brain

1767
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,280
doesn't mean you're looking for the

1768
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,960
neuron level description

1769
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,480
having the system of interest to be the

1770
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,280
live stream or the audience doesn't mean

1771
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,039
that we need to know every single person

1772
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,000
or how video encoders work

1773
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,319
so it's an application oriented approach

1774
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,520
perhaps even an action-oriented approach

1775
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,760
that cuts through

1776
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,160
some of these questions or sidesteps or

1777
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,880
saves them for savoring you know after

1778
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,799
the project has been completed after

1779
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,960
we've made the changes on the real world

1780
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,079
it savors some of these truly excellent

1781
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,720
philosophical and important questions

1782
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,520
while also allowing us to act

1783
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,839
reasonably in the moment

1784
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,319
and so it's always that

1785
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,880
north star of a unified model of

1786
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,280
perception cognition and action that's

1787
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,920
so motivating so even as some of the

1788
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,920
formalisms do evolve

1789
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,480
we hope that we can respect the the

1790
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,200
spirit and the inertia of the research

1791
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,839
that we've carried out and also know

1792
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,400
when we can modularly swap in new

1793
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,359
elements of the framework so blue and

1794
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,880
then of course any questions in the live

1795
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,039
chat

1796
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,319
so

1797
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,160
as a modeler

1798
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,599
how would i model

1799
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,839
this conversation really like let's talk

1800
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,400
about how to really model it um and not

1801
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,359
from a philosophical standpoint like if

1802
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,559
this is my model of the fep i have a

1803
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,720
model of the fep that exists in my brain

1804
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,440
as does daniel steven maxwell we all

1805
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,640
have a model of what the fep looks like

1806
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,720
every time we read a paper have a

1807
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,920
conversation take input from our it's

1808
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,520
the action perception loop right my

1809
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,480
model exists it's in my internal states

1810
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,240
through my senses i perceive read here

1811
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,839
something that either confirms my model

1812
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,160
provides evidence for my existing model

1813
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,720
reduces my uncertainty about my existing

1814
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,319
model so i have some evidence input

1815
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,880
through my senses then i update my model

1816
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,280
or if it doesn't jive or if it makes me

1817
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,960
realize something i mean always we're

1818
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,880
gaining information so there's this

1819
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,960
epistemic value add

1820
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,119
through doing these conversations these

1821
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,119
live streams reading papers having these

1822
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,520
discussions etc so my my model is

1823
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,440
updated through these conversations and

1824
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,839
then holistically we kind of come to a

1825
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,960
place where

1826
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,559
our models either

1827
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,720
converge through this communicative

1828
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,960
process on something that resembles each

1829
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,440
other's models more similarly or not

1830
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,119
right we might have this divergence and

1831
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,640
then we go away with like this

1832
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,839
uncertainty like is my model wrong or or

1833
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,359
what was that argument about i mean

1834
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,960
everyone's been in conversations or

1835
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,200
discussions or heated scientific debates

1836
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,319
where

1837
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,599
you don't really

1838
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,240
come to a consensus right there is no

1839
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,559
general agreement or understanding and

1840
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,880
so then you walk away with maybe some

1841
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,280
some maybe my model is invalid and then

1842
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,559
do some more deep thought about it i

1843
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,160
mean that that's how i would

1844
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,760
that's how i would model it that's just

1845
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,559
me

1846
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,240
in the viat can at all 2020 paper with

1847
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,079
active inference and systems engineering

1848
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,799
systems thinking we use this

1849
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,000
font framework formal documents ontology

1850
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,880
narratives and tools and so one kind of

1851
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,000
fun parallel or a way that conversation

1852
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and the real dynamics that arise can be

1853
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,680
modeled in active inference is like

1854
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,000
agree to disagree

1855
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,359
two individuals can have high precision

1856
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:36,960
and convergence on a narrative inference

1857
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,359
we're agreeing to disagree

1858
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,119
they can both be precise and agreed on

1859
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,680
that and then at the first level they

1860
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,599
can literally disagree

1861
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,200
that's the whole point

1862
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
so that is

1863
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,400
modeled in active inference as

1864
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,880
nested models just like maxwell brought

1865
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,680
up

1866
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,920
and so we have nested models and the

1867
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,400
second order matrix can be

1868
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,720
the same between two agents

1869
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,359
yet their first level matrix can be very

1870
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,400
different

1871
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,799
and none of those matrices are the

1872
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,280
system map territory

1873
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,400
mel andrews acting 14. so we've come

1874
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,080
back to these ideas and we'll continue

1875
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,799
to

1876
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,880
dance around them many many times

1877
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,960
because they're

1878
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,120
so fundamental that sometimes they're

1879
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,560
hard to see

1880
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,799
play out so steven and then anyone else

1881
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,359
yeah i think we

1882
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,479
have to be

1883
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,920
careful

1884
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,040
to note that it appears as if

1885
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,399
um information

1886
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,080
like what active inference tells us it

1887
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,520
appears if

1888
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,198
knowledge is coming in

1889
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,319
and that it's being we we see it in our

1890
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,880
heads so to speak and

1891
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,839
um

1892
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,839
yet

1893
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,960
the this conversation is is we're we're

1894
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,158
tuning

1895
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,839
through the action of our info niche our

1896
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,319
semantic niche of talking

1897
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,479
and we're aligning

1898
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,880
what our actions

1899
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,319
give us

1900
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,319
in our externality

1901
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,399
be it through the diagrams be it through

1902
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,120
this document and the slides or whatever

1903
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,279
the boundary objects are that we can

1904
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,640
align to

1905
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,120
given us partly due to our own folk

1906
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,238
psychology over the last 150 years the

1907
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,839
sense and this thing is really hard to

1908
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,000
counter this because this is kind of the

1909
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,719
way we tend to think you know that

1910
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,120
we have it in our minds

1911
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,960
i so to speak

1912
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,319
so it's true there's like this

1913
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,640
generative model yet at the same time

1914
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,319
the generative

1915
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,759
modeling

1916
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,520
is also part of what we're doing we're

1917
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,198
generatively modeling each other's

1918
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,719
conversation

1919
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,640
and getting a sense of how i

1920
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,080
should say my actions of words

1921
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,159
none of those sentences were pre-made in

1922
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,159
my head you know they

1923
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,400
it's an action policy that's close

1924
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,800
enough to my sense-making so that it

1925
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,040
feels like i'm on the right track right

1926
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,560
and until someone looks at me really

1927
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,199
strange this is the um i'll carry on and

1928
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,640
i've been in these conversations a few

1929
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,280
times a bit more where how to

1930
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,679
keep doing right but i think that's

1931
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,320
something that's quite useful to when we

1932
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,400
talk about this modeling is

1933
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,560
oh we're modeling the action policies

1934
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,159
that are externalized and our generative

1935
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,920
model

1936
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,719
is

1937
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,920
as good as it is at being able to enact

1938
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,320
um through participatory sense making

1939
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,239
what should happen next

1940
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,280
more than it is about having

1941
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,080
something that we've received

1942
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,440
in our generative model

1943
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,320
thanks steven that speaks to the

1944
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,520
interactionist versus instructionalism

1945
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,800
like is the fep model that blue is

1946
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,400
describing this generative model of the

1947
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,679
fep that's

1948
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,400
um in or embodied by all of us is it

1949
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,199
like a skyscraper made of glass and

1950
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,159
piping and there's 90 degree angles or

1951
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,280
is it

1952
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,120
some other type of metaphor that or even

1953
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,120
transcending metaphor

1954
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,199
and only realize through

1955
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,280
certain sequences of interaction

1956
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,800
so that's um really interesting

1957
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,440
and uh cool yeah there's great comments

1958
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,040
dave's uh throwing some biblical

1959
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,640
references in the chat

1960
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,960
and someone wrote i'm here first time in

1961
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,800
the live stream it's so good to listen

1962
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,640
all the cutting edge discussion about

1963
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,280
fep keep up the good work so

1964
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,840
nice work stephen and blue but thanks

1965
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,480
also for joining you have

1966
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,560
tuned your regime of attention

1967
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,960
hopefully you're having some

1968
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,679
questions and thoughts come to mind just

1969
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,440
as they are for us we're just on the

1970
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,880
other side of the video chat window and

1971
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,760
the participatory sense making side

1972
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,400
and how to mobilize that and enact it

1973
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,239
we can have participatory sense making

1974
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,560
with people on the video stream those

1975
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,159
who make asynchronous edits and

1976
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,920
improvements to these slides like we

1977
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,760
still have to go through blues

1978
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,640
prior thoughts that were added to um

1979
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,280
this slide deck and then

1980
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,840
from a history of science perspective

1981
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,239
and sociology like it's happening in a

1982
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,600
new way

1983
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,880
one thing that

1984
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,800
what was impressed on us

1985
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,920
i guess

1986
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,480
months to years ago forever ago in

1987
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,320
crypto active was like the time scale of

1988
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,760
these discussions

1989
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,960
going from

1990
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,440
peer review and annual conferences in

1991
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,800
person in annual or multi-annual cycles

1992
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,199
to like the pre-print

1993
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,679
and then we send the twitter message to

1994
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,520
the author of the preprint could you

1995
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,960
give a guest stream

1996
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,280
and then the authors can respond like

1997
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,360
looking at what maxwell wrote which was

1998
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,960
very important or said

1999
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,040
like bayesian mechanics that was live

2000
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,840
stream number 26. so we did a zero

2001
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,159
contextualizing video respecting that

2002
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,480
people have many different backgrounds

2003
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,400
approaching the work from

2004
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,800
and then two of the commentaries

2005
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,560
beel and

2006
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,840
um also aguilaria aguilara were in guest

2007
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,840
stream number five and seven

2008
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,440
so it's like we've

2009
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,840
heard from many of the important

2010
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,120
perspectives

2011
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,320
and that's this participatory scientific

2012
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,600
sense making

2013
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,719
were all part of a bigger positive

2014
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,199
project that's transdisciplinary it's

2015
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,400
not even just happening in the

2016
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,159
scientific literature

2017
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,280
but it has to a large extent been

2018
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,120
because these are research research

2019
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,560
advances these are conceptual

2020
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,719
theoretical advances

2021
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,840
and now we're all learning by doing

2022
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,040
and increasingly doing and applying

2023
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,239
and so there's so much to learn and do

2024
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,640
so um blue and then stephen and then

2025
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,000
there's more great questions in the live

2026
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,760
chat so go ahead

2027
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,560
so

2028
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,560
you're like giving shouts out to us but

2029
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,640
i just want to like thank daniel for all

2030
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,640
the scaffolding that he's provided in

2031
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,040
the actin flab like to give us these um

2032
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,000
kind of

2033
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,679
the baseline for these discussions to

2034
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,120
take place um and also uh just to kind

2035
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,760
of um go back to what stephen was saying

2036
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,400
about you know about modeling and

2037
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,239
enacting um

2038
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,760
really like i don't see knowledge as

2039
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,320
coming in right like when i'm in the in

2040
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,440
the modeling

2041
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,679
sense like i don't know that what you

2042
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,440
have is knowledge or what daniel has is

2043
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,440
knowledge or what the paper contains is

2044
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,520
knowledge um all of that in my world is

2045
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,960
information

2046
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,520
and i i think that there's a difference

2047
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,480
between knowledge and information and so

2048
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,719
like when i'm interpreting comments by

2049
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,600
maxwell or steven or daniel when i'm

2050
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,960
interpreting that

2051
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,679
i take that information and

2052
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,840
transform it through my model right like

2053
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,080
so so some of what like take it or leave

2054
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,440
it or take what you want from this

2055
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,360
discussion and it's always like that i

2056
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,040
mean we always do that whether people

2057
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,440
have to remind us you know to do it or

2058
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,239
not right like you take away the parts

2059
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,040
that validate your model right

2060
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,640
or that improve upon your model or that

2061
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,199
you believe improve upon your model in

2062
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:24,880
some way so so then when i have it and i

2063
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,600
i have transformed it then maybe i can

2064
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,840
turn it into knowledge but i don't see

2065
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,920
coming in anything coming in as

2066
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,239
knowledge that's just me

2067
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,239
and with video chat it becomes super

2068
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,480
real like when there's lag all of a

2069
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,000
sudden it's like you're at the semantic

2070
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,159
level and then it's like wait just the

2071
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:45,120
syntax i'm not hearing the words and so

2072
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,040
it's like we dip into this

2073
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,280
lower level and then imagine if the

2074
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,600
audio is working fine you can totally

2075
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,600
hear

2076
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,120
non-equilibrium steady state

2077
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,719
but then conceptually what does that

2078
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,760
mean so these nested and overlapping

2079
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,000
layers of meaning so that's just very

2080
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,520
cool so steven and then there's a

2081
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,239
question in the chat

2082
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,560
yeah this is a good point blue and

2083
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,480
i suppose it's there's also this sense

2084
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,679
that

2085
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,920
there's always got to be some belief in

2086
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,760
what you think the other person's saying

2087
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,760
like for instance i believe the words

2088
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,520
mean xyz because i know the english

2089
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,840
language right if we're all speaking in

2090
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,600
the language didn't know so

2091
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,480
i believe this word means this i hear

2092
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,600
this word these words together mean this

2093
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,560
so there's

2094
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,880
there's always and i'm hearing it seeing

2095
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,719
it i'm feeling it the fact that my chair

2096
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,760
is comfortable changes things right um

2097
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,960
so

2098
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,040
there is this um

2099
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,480
this

2100
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,159
sense that

2101
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,880
the

2102
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,640
you know they talk about this in free

2103
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,800
energy principle is like it can also

2104
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,840
appear like you know so things as well

2105
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,679
as there being bayesian influence that

2106
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,679
you can appear like there's a bayesian

2107
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,080
influence type process which is

2108
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,440
what's happening

2109
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,360
my models can be updated and i think

2110
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,840
what i'm really interested in is

2111
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,760
for some of these things to then to be

2112
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,920
capitulated as knowledge

2113
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,679
i think there has to be and this is

2114
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,840
where the 4e work comes in

2115
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,239
is we we bring this into some

2116
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:18,239
subconscious embodied meta well embodied

2117
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,120
practices which we can really tap into

2118
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,960
by sort of eliciting what they're like

2119
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,960
maybe getting a metaphor it feels like

2120
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,640
the knowledge is coming from around me

2121
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,159
and i'm grabbing it some other people it

2122
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,000
feels like it's coming in as a sequence

2123
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,239
of very clear things

2124
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,400
so my way of

2125
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,560
assembling

2126
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,600
um

2127
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,640
the

2128
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,000
connections of my belief structure to

2129
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,880
the

2130
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,199
sensory information coming in

2131
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,000
will capitulate my modeling

2132
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,960
and

2133
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,199
as best i can i'm going to be then

2134
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,040
trying to attune to the way everyone

2135
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,199
else is and we're all i'm sure it'd be

2136
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,960
different if we're all standing up

2137
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,880
during all of these talks

2138
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,679
we might actually interpret and process

2139
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,120
a bit different if we're all in a pool

2140
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,440
having a cocktail you know i don't know

2141
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,960
i think blue's on a stationary bike

2142
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,040
about half the time

2143
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,880
i have my stationary bike hidden out of

2144
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,280
you but let's ask a question yeah

2145
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,760
exactly we could do a ride stream

2146
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,520
um we could do a pull stream but you

2147
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,360
gotta come to my house

2148
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,239
cool i remember that so

2149
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,960
let's ask a question from the live chat

2150
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,080
and then we'll return to some of blue's

2151
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,239
previously phrased questions

2152
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,320
about the paper and that's what's kind

2153
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,040
of fun like in the dot zero we get a lot

2154
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,159
of the details and the bulk of the paper

2155
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,320
and all the key ideas and figures if

2156
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,040
there are them and then in the dot one

2157
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,679
there's so many directions to go

2158
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,440
and i remember earlier it's like wait

2159
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,400
two times two hours group discussion on

2160
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,360
a paper

2161
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,080
i'm used to academia papers being

2162
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,280
discussed for one hour if ever and

2163
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,120
people having very heterogeneous

2164
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,480
understandings or they did or didn't

2165
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,320
read the paper so

2166
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,360
yet

2167
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,600
we find that there's always enough

2168
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,080
questions when we open the doors of the

2169
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,920
conversation to just like super

2170
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,199
fascinating

2171
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,360
direct directions for the discussion so

2172
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,120
again we'll ask a great question in the

2173
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,800
chat and then we'll kind of turn to some

2174
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,280
of these one questions because next week

2175
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,960
hopefully we'll have one or both of the

2176
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,000
authors to be talking with

2177
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,920
so joseph wrote

2178
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,000
how has active inference

2179
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,320
changed the way you view the world in

2180
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,080
daily life

2181
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,520
that's a big

2182
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,480
question

2183
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,800
do either of you want to go first or i'm

2184
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,440
happy to go

2185
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,400
i yeah i can chip in if you

2186
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,239
well one of the ways i've actually found

2187
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,080
it really helpful

2188
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,400
and i thought is um

2189
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,800
changing the way i think about how i see

2190
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,400
the world

2191
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,000
um

2192
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,840
and also a bit

2193
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,800
change that i think about playing soccer

2194
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,000
so

2195
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,960
uh

2196
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,159
so the first one is

2197
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,880
there was a there was this sense that

2198
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,760
you know

2199
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,760
i i i'm seeing the world right um and

2200
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,400
it's all a bit separate from me with

2201
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,639
active influence it it can be quite nice

2202
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,320
to go out and think about actually

2203
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,239
perturbing the world and feeling the

2204
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,679
world as if you're feeling the world

2205
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,920
with your eyes club touched touching the

2206
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,840
world with your hands seeing the world

2207
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,760
and touching the world with your eyes

2208
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,199
and i think

2209
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,400
that actually

2210
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,440
can help bring me out of my

2211
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,560
head so to speak in a metaphorical sense

2212
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,120
so i found that useful actually just

2213
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
thinking about that the world as being

2214
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,960
something that's

2215
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,560
out there and it's very much something

2216
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,199
i'm sensing and uh so that takes a

2217
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,560
little bit of the

2218
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,719
modernistic kind of concreteness and

2219
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,480
then with soccer as well

2220
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,920
it made me realize i used to always

2221
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,600
think you see those things on telly like

2222
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,280
you know like someone's kicking a ball

2223
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,800
you know like the equation's a bit like

2224
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,639
um terminates you know

2225
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,639
but now it's like well actually it's

2226
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,800
it's more like i'm just

2227
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,719
i'm just getting whatever my feeling is

2228
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,239
right and that whole

2229
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,000
other stuff it doesn't matter so then

2230
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,280
you realize all these really great

2231
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,639
sports players

2232
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,560
the really the ones that you

2233
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,719
they're they're actually they they've

2234
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,800
they've acclimatized to

2235
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,440
what it means to like methody must have

2236
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,440
this feeling for what it means to kick

2237
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,520
he doesn't need to have the trajectory

2238
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,159
of the ball in his head so anyway i

2239
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,840
don't know if that helps us go through

2240
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,159
my crazy head

2241
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,639
blue you want to go or i have okay so

2242
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,560
there's a few angles and this could

2243
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,920
definitely be

2244
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,920
a worthy topic for another discussion

2245
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,320
but just to give a few angles so first

2246
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,800
thinking how we view the world that was

2247
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,040
a visual illusion in the original

2248
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,080
question

2249
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,639
and so it reminds me of the

2250
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,480
development of thought

2251
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,679
from seeing the world that's the signal

2252
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,560
processing paradigm photons are pouring

2253
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,280
in and we're seeing categorizing

2254
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,080
classifying the world okay

2255
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,880
then we have predictive processing

2256
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,120
and that's like well you know our visual

2257
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,320
field

2258
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
for most individuals they see color in

2259
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,400
their entire visual field and there's

2260
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,480
equal clarity in their visual field even

2261
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,320
though there's an extremely

2262
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,800
heterogeneous distribution of resolution

2263
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,120
and color elements in the retina and we

2264
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,159
have a big old blind spot so color

2265
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,400
clarity of vision and blind spot

2266
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
suggests that we're experiencing a

2267
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,960
generative model a predictive model a

2268
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,880
vision that's predictive processing and

2269
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,560
it applies also to other sensory

2270
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,280
modalities and then that third step was

2271
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,440
where stephen took it with the active

2272
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,400
vision the epistemic foraging

2273
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,400
and we know that even though we don't

2274
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,800
directly experience these either

2275
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,199
there's eye circades which move to the

2276
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,000
most informative part of the visual

2277
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,040
scene

2278
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,960
so to me it's about moving from signal

2279
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,880
processing 1.0 to predictive processing

2280
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,320
to active sensing and exploration as

2281
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,760
informed by

2282
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,320
epistemic and pragmatic value together

2283
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,000
you know eyes on the ball but you got to

2284
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,080
also see more than that generate more

2285
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,760
than that so that's one

2286
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,600
really important part the second one

2287
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,000
i'll also parallel exactly what steven

2288
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,480
said which is like it made me think even

2289
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,679
though i don't know about soccer i don't

2290
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,480
know about the tele wrong continent but

2291
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,800
it's kind of like the top down the video

2292
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,960
game model where there's like i see it

2293
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,560
more and more in sports replays where

2294
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,520
it's like

2295
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,040
it will pause and

2296
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,719
it will look like a video game

2297
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,400
but that's not

2298
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,639
the action model of the player on the

2299
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,840
field

2300
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,120
they're

2301
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,920
using much more of a personal flow

2302
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,679
and a feel and interactions and cues

2303
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,760
and so they don't need to be

2304
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,480
having this 30 000 foot view

2305
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,840
they need

2306
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,800
the parry personal perspective so that

2307
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,199
is one piece and then just one a third

2308
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,199
one but i think another there's many

2309
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,639
more we could list

2310
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,000
would be like

2311
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,360
the reward oriented worldview

2312
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,159
so reward maximization is the paradigm

2313
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,239
reinforcement learning is how neurons

2314
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,360
associate

2315
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,679
utility maximization is what investing

2316
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:18,960
is about

2317
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,760
in contrast with an uncertainty

2318
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,679
reduction paradigm

2319
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,440
a precision optimization paradigm where

2320
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,560
qualified levels of precision of nested

2321
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,679
models

2322
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,080
allow a lot of flexibility

2323
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,320
and a lot more realistic phenomenology

2324
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,000
for different models

2325
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,639
because precision pursuit

2326
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:43,520
on an optimistic world model gets you

2327
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,400
utility

2328
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,120
so i just think we get utility from a

2329
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,600
precision first worldview but from a

2330
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,440
utility oriented worldview we don't

2331
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,120
always get precision

2332
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,320
and that

2333
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,159
i personally connect to how if we have

2334
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,159
like a tetrahedral based geometry of

2335
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,639
nature we get cubes but if we start with

2336
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,600
cubic geometry we never get tetrahedra

2337
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,520
so that's sort of where i connect it

2338
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,159
utility is like bigger and a more

2339
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,239
general framework because utility falls

2340
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,639
out of precision on an optimistic

2341
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,880
generative model but merely having

2342
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,280
utility it's always going to be ad hoc

2343
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,239
or secondary where does curiosity and

2344
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,159
epistemic gain and all these other

2345
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,159
features of real decision making so

2346
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:26,159
those are a few of the key pieces how it

2347
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,559
changes how i've seen the world blue

2348
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,520
so

2349
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,840
besides from like having integrated

2350
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,600
fully into like my daily vocabulary

2351
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,199
which is like you know we talk about

2352
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:42,880
things like the generative model like

2353
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,520
you know in completely unrelated offline

2354
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,120
conversations um so aside from like you

2355
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,639
know enhancing my vocabulary and

2356
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,800
building this new language of you know

2357
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,040
the fvp um

2358
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,360
that which is that's weird right like

2359
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,120
okay um

2360
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,760
but aside from that you know one of the

2361
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,639
things one of the recurrent um themes

2362
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,440
for me in active inference has been

2363
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,080
um the idea like we we touched on it in

2364
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,719
the mental action paper that we did like

2365
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,719
daniel you're gonna have to pull the

2366
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,239
pull it up for me because i can now

2367
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,760
remember you've got a better track

2368
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,679
you've got your model is updated and

2369
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,520
configured with all of the appropriate

2370
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,639
um

2371
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,560
live stream numbers more more so than

2372
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,880
mine it's 28. it's 28 and it's only

2373
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,480
because of my extended niche but

2374
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,320
continue that's it and and so can you

2375
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,159
also query your extended niche because i

2376
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:33,520
can't ever remember the one where we

2377
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,840
talked about anxiety like was it if it

2378
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,760
was big five or sophisticated active

2379
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
inference or i always ask which one that

2380
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,600
one was but i can't ever that was a long

2381
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,080
time ago uh um but but going back you

2382
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,320
know touching on mental action and

2383
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,880
meditation and the idea that we touched

2384
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,440
on way in the long ago live stream of

2385
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,360
anxiety representing you know trying to

2386
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,760
project too many time steps ahead into

2387
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,400
the future like and having this relate

2388
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,040
to anxiety and and then like depression

2389
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,600
is relating to you know fixating too

2390
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,400
many steps in the past behind you right

2391
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,480
like so this like model of like

2392
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,080
neuroatypical

2393
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,000
things it just always reminds me to come

2394
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,280
back to the present moment and i'm

2395
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,960
looking for an excuse to do that anyway

2396
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,639
just because of my inclinations toward

2397
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,360
eastern religion and so forth so but but

2398
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,040
the reminder to stay in the present

2399
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,080
moment has now been like made through an

2400
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,560
appeal to my logical brain like outside

2401
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,000
of a spiritual

2402
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,639
sense and so that that kind of is is a

2403
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,800
cool you know effect of of active

2404
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,239
inference i think

2405
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,120
awesome

2406
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,639
there's so many fun

2407
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,600
questions in in the chat so i mean i'll

2408
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,159
i'll ask these and then we can we can

2409
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,840
we'll still have time to return to the

2410
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,520
paper so mihail asks okay one

2411
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,440
if you were to let your imagination roam

2412
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,440
freely where do you

2413
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,400
wish

2414
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
or see the best possible real life

2415
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,120
application so for that question

2416
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,040
that's a question for

2417
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,159
us

2418
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,600
and the community and beyond

2419
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,199
so we can maybe each just mention one

2420
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:12,159
thought that we're having but you know

2421
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,600
if you see

2422
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,760
a possible future state

2423
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,320
active inference of x

2424
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,639
let's act infer serve

2425
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,159
let's act first update our models and

2426
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,320
serve and make the impact that we want

2427
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,120
to see so this is actually an affordance

2428
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,520
of a question because if two people are

2429
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,440
like wow we should do this

2430
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
or could this be useful

2431
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,320
if you can state it you're like 90 of

2432
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,679
the way there and we hope to develop the

2433
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:42,719
sort of

2434
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,199
um transdisciplinary tools

2435
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,080
like active inference agent software and

2436
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,120
the expertise tools people and ideas and

2437
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,159
the education so that when somebody else

2438
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,679
who's not on this live stream there's

2439
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,880
just three of us

2440
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,080
has that

2441
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,639
insight or sees it being applied in a

2442
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,000
new way

2443
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,040
we want to help you scaffold that action

2444
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,360
trajectory but blue and then stephen

2445
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,360
so i guess i always come back to this

2446
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,760
too something that fascinates me fully

2447
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,400
is how information is integrated across

2448
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,440
scales so how is the model of of my you

2449
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,080
know dna strands imported into my cells

2450
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,320
imported into my tissues imported into

2451
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,800
my organs imported into my sense of self

2452
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,880
right like so how does this and how do i

2453
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,480
import into the organisms that i'm part

2454
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,000
of like the active inference lab and so

2455
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,159
forth so for me really like

2456
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,719
concretely realizing a mathematical way

2457
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:37,440
to

2458
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,320
find information passing up and down

2459
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,320
like is it salience or what else what

2460
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,520
other way this emergence like for me

2461
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,600
that's like it like if active inference

2462
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,520
can nail that and this is like a fantasy

2463
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,960
daydream and i know people are working

2464
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,440
towards that but it's out there in the

2465
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,199
future but if i could really wish one

2466
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,880
thing if i could you know daydream about

2467
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,719
my ultimate fantasy of active inference

2468
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,440
being fulfilled it's completely that

2469
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,040
okay awesome modeling nested biological

2470
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,639
systems something that we've seen

2471
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,159
qualitatively

2472
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,760
discussed in the literature like

2473
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,080
ramstead at all 2018

2474
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,600
answering schrodinger's question

2475
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,679
variational ecology variational

2476
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,840
neuroethology a lot of contributors to

2477
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,239
these works but that kind of a model

2478
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,519
would be epic stephen

2479
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,239
yeah i'm really interested i think

2480
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,400
active inference

2481
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,560
it doesn't have to do everything to be

2482
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,400
really a contribution it can it can it

2483
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
can fill certain gaps as well or give

2484
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,080
certain mechanisms

2485
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,800
that can give an insight either to

2486
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,000
tractably give away to model or a way to

2487
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,159
just think about things so

2488
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,560
what i'm curious about and i'm working

2489
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,080
on something called conceptual action

2490
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,920
sociometry which is a

2491
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,679
an action method

2492
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,840
um i'm trying to

2493
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,800
i'm really interested in how to

2494
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,199
work back from a high complexity context

2495
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,120
which would be too many dimensions to

2496
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,080
model from first principles

2497
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,360
so rather than modeling

2498
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,159
the generative model per se

2499
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,400
i'm looking at how to

2500
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,480
create an instrument

2501
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,600
to

2502
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,960
track the info niche be inscribed

2503
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,320
by

2504
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:24,080
the agent so it's almost like a trace

2505
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,360
um

2506
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,560
so

2507
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,080
i'm i'm

2508
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,639
really interested in how we can

2509
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,400
go both ways

2510
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,000
as well as the sort of general

2511
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,239
extractable

2512
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,719
sort of principled work that can be show

2513
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,360
how generative models are happening and

2514
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,920
being applied across things like context

2515
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,000
of autism and other areas where there's

2516
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,840
different types of

2517
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,080
classifications i'm really interested in

2518
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,080
kind of contextual work which will be

2519
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,360
outside of the ability to do full

2520
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,719
research but might be able to do an

2521
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,639
inquiry process and

2522
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,199
how to sort of just get a grip on that

2523
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,960
inquiry so

2524
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,120
um be it people looking at their lived

2525
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,120
experiences and things like that and

2526
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,719
we're actually talking about that in the

2527
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:09,679
tools

2528
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:10,960
section people are sort of giving me

2529
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,120
some advice

2530
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,040
or open to that once

2531
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,440
we get to the next phase

2532
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,920
awesome thanks for also sharing that and

2533
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,440
then i think the system just the one

2534
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,600
that i'll mention would be

2535
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,760
online teams or

2536
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,199
research

2537
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,560
knowledge

2538
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,760
inquiry

2539
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,679
and doing scholarship

2540
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,239
and just at this point in time just

2541
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,840
facilitating the reduction of our

2542
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,560
uncertainty on the history of active

2543
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,400
inference and free energy principle

2544
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,239
literature

2545
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:45,920
in a few other areas because um tools

2546
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,480
for research and sense making would be

2547
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,239
really awesome for a lot of different

2548
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,159
reasons so cool and then the second

2549
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,560
question um from the hill in that

2550
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,679
sequence was

2551
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,760
what if we model our group conversation

2552
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,080
where we as humans disappear

2553
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,000
and where we are not exploring the

2554
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,480
universe but the universe is exploring

2555
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,678
itself utilizing us

2556
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,880
a beautiful

2557
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,840
thought question and there's a lot to

2558
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,960
think about that so blue

2559
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,760
yeah i mean i think that this uh

2560
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,800
is

2561
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,639
possible right and

2562
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:23,600
you know

2563
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,719
we've talked about it in the

2564
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,320
computational boundary of the self the

2565
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,239
mike levin paper like

2566
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,639
ultimately it's like dissolution of the

2567
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,719
cognitive boundary and is there some

2568
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,719
like meta organism this goes to like the

2569
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,440
gaia hypothesis maybe not the universe

2570
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,600
but the earth or maybe the earth is part

2571
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,520
of the universe maybe there's some ultra

2572
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,639
ultimate like super organism that that

2573
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:47,199
cognitive boundary contains all of us

2574
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,360
and so just in the same way that like

2575
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,360
our cells are working towards our

2576
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,440
optimal function given the circumstances

2577
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,679
that they're they're presented with

2578
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,320
right like given that assumption maybe

2579
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,400
we're also working toward the optimal

2580
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,000
state of the universe like every

2581
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,679
interaction that occurs between all of

2582
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,920
us is working toward the optimal state

2583
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,360
of the active inference lab or the

2584
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,960
optimal state of the united states of

2585
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,800
america or the optimal state of you know

2586
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,960
scientific research or who knows right

2587
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,719
so any kind of

2588
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,159
you know

2589
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,000
umbrella category that we might fall

2590
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,159
into maybe we're serving the optimal

2591
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,480
state of that and really like i think

2592
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,199
it's

2593
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,600
quite possible and a really cool way to

2594
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,320
model active inference for sure

2595
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,280
another

2596
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,480
take on that from bucky fuller is this

2597
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,600
function

2598
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,400
first mentality led him to ask well what

2599
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,920
is the function

2600
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,360
of human

2601
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,760
and are we local sensemaker what is our

2602
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,760
role so those are big important

2603
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,040
questions

2604
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,480
let's return to

2605
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,080
31.1

2606
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,119
and kind of prime ourselves for our dot

2607
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,600
two because in the dot zero that's where

2608
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,280
like whoever's really excited about the

2609
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,199
paper maybe whoever contacted the

2610
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,199
authors or maybe one of the authors

2611
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,119
themselves or just a few people who want

2612
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,199
to learn by doing the dot zero which was

2613
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,679
like blue and i for this one 31.1 the

2614
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,119
previous video

2615
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,920
we go through the paper the dot one we

2616
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,560
unpack that's sort of the bathtub phase

2617
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,480
everything is getting spread out a lot

2618
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,080
of sociological

2619
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:19,600
criticisms or uh insights a few random

2620
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,199
questions from the get from the guests

2621
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,639
of our stream

2622
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,320
a lot of different areas a lot of

2623
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,400
threads get pulled out and then in the

2624
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,520
dot 2 we try to have some synthesis

2625
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,719
because it's not the end of the

2626
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,960
discussion with the dot 2 but

2627
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,639
we have to move on from a live stream

2628
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,880
perspective so the dot 2 especially when

2629
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,440
the authors can be there we can get some

2630
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,199
more insights we can resolve some

2631
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:44,080
questions that arose during the dot one

2632
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,719
and dot zero and the inter

2633
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,800
uh meaning times so questions that

2634
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,239
didn't arise

2635
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,080
before we enacted

2636
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,360
this process

2637
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,360
and then we get to ask those and then

2638
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,199
kind of use that as our jumping off

2639
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:00,320
point as we move on to our next phase so

2640
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,000
here in the dot one

2641
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,280
at the end

2642
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,920
it's kind of like a fractal.2 we're kind

2643
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,080
of trying to tie a few things together

2644
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,159
returning to the text as a strange

2645
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,560
attractor so that we'll have a whole

2646
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,239
week to read think sleep

2647
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,080
stationary bicycle

2648
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,400
mind and body relax

2649
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,520
maybe do our day job if we can find any

2650
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,719
and um

2651
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,960
be here you know next week or whenever

2652
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,760
works to continue the discussion so blue

2653
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,880
um in this questions for 31.1

2654
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,639
what were some

2655
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,560
quotes or some questions from the paper

2656
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,320
that you wanted to like learn more about

2657
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,159
or ask the authors about

2658
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,639
well just as i mentioned um you know

2659
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,560
even earlier in this live stream today

2660
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,360
like

2661
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,040
the dynamic

2662
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,360
equilibrium of living systems like i'm

2663
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,199
not understanding that at all like maybe

2664
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:54,159
that's homeostasis but homeostasis is

2665
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,800
not in my mind dynamic equilibrium and i

2666
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,440
think that this um you know bayesian

2667
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,040
mechanics for stationary processes and

2668
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,719
the idea of a non-equilibrium steady

2669
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,000
state density

2670
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,400
uh kind of supersedes

2671
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,880
this concept of dynamic equilibrium

2672
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,119
because homeostasis is not equilibrium

2673
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,520
and so that's kind of a fundamental like

2674
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,040
it like bends in my brain a little bit

2675
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,480
when i when i've been reading over this

2676
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,400
paper um

2677
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,199
and also uh you know it says here we

2678
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,560
should pay closer attention to

2679
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,320
fundamental differences between physics

2680
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,239
and biology um and how these

2681
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,159
indifferences interact with importing

2682
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:30,000
concepts from physics into the modeling

2683
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,400
of biological targets so

2684
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,600
i mean

2685
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,000
is it physics all the way down because i

2686
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,119
always thought it was physics all the

2687
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,880
way down right like so i don't know that

2688
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,840
goes

2689
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
to um

2690
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,119
you know like

2691
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,639
when i was in school they always said

2692
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,360
like you know biology is not as precise

2693
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,880
as chemistry and chemistry is not as

2694
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,480
precise as physics and physics is not as

2695
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,320
precise as math right like so there's

2696
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,880
this like tiered hierarchy of how you

2697
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,119
know fundamental your

2698
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,040
study can be right

2699
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,880
and so

2700
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,199
it i think biology is based in the

2701
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,040
concept of physics but but also

2702
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,960
chemistry i feel like was really omitted

2703
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,960
and left out and like in my heart i'm a

2704
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,719
chemist uh stephen i'm sure can relate

2705
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:11,520
to that

2706
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,159
um but really like so so that's kind of

2707
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,239
one other uh thing i wanted to explore

2708
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:17,920
and then um

2709
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,639
the other part of um

2710
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:22,000
of the questions that i have for the

2711
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,480
authors are you know in active inference

2712
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,560
are the active states internal um

2713
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,239
because they said in internal states

2714
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,560
include active states but i have always

2715
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,239
thought of active states and sensory

2716
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,960
states as part of the interface between

2717
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,800
internal and external states as part of

2718
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,560
the markov blanket and so i just wanted

2719
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,400
to clear that up maybe if that's a

2720
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,199
misunderstanding on my part or

2721
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,040
i mean i guess action can happen

2722
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,719
internally like as we've seen in the

2723
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,080
mental action

2724
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,000
so that's definitely possible but but

2725
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,960
not all active states are part of

2726
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,400
internal states

2727
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,719
i thought so i don't know maybe that's

2728
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,400
some something that we can tease apart

2729
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,760
with the authors and i'm looking forward

2730
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,760
to having them here and asking them

2731
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,080
these three questions which are the ones

2732
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,600
that kind of for me

2733
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,480
um you know don't align with my current

2734
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,719
model of the fbp

2735
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,119
they were salient they

2736
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,880
were different from your generative mall

2737
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,560
so it's a nice way to put it and then

2738
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,920
i'll just show this one comic and then

2739
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:22,320
steven so this is a classical uh xkcd

2740
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,360
comic

2741
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,679
the field's arranged by purity okay so

2742
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,119
it's a comic you know

2743
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:28,960
retweets are not endorsements but you

2744
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,760
have

2745
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,159
uh this is a classic disciplinary

2746
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,920
hierarchy slash

2747
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,639
ponzi scheme pyramid scheme whatever you

2748
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:37,440
know

2749
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,199
you have uh the physicist let's just

2750
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,800
start in the middle it's nice to be on

2751
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,719
top that's the the common

2752
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,480
pinnacle of the pyramid in certain

2753
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,880
paradigms and then like the physicists

2754
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,360
can make claims about lower levels but

2755
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,880
then if the psychologist makes a claim

2756
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,040
about physics hey we need a sociology of

2757
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,440
molecules it'd be like that's

2758
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,199
not science

2759
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,880
but then the physicist talking about

2760
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,520
sociophysics is like wow that's so

2761
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,920
modern and exciting so there's a sort of

2762
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,080
um linearity

2763
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,280
as well as potentially some sociological

2764
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,360
scaffolding that facilitates the

2765
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,000
diffusion of information and expertise

2766
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,040
and uh notoriety like one way but it's

2767
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,679
not always a two-way street and then the

2768
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,360
joke i guess in the xkcd is like the

2769
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,440
mathematician saying hey i didn't see

2770
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,320
you all from over here so again just a

2771
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,920
comic now

2772
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,159
playing with the media what does it look

2773
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,800
like to i don't know close the loop

2774
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,679
or

2775
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:34,800
have these

2776
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,040
learn about each other's perspective or

2777
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,280
there's a million ways that we could

2778
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,320
go counterfactual on this xkcd

2779
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,840
what if i mean that's the name of the

2780
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,639
xkcd's author's book which is kind of

2781
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:47,440
fun

2782
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,239
um but how does active inference

2783
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,840
challenge this

2784
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,320
either specifically or just how are

2785
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,360
broader ongoing sequences of actions

2786
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,320
like

2787
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,440
decentralized science desai open science

2788
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,639
open access open source global

2789
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:05,960
collaboration

2790
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,560
transdisciplinary application complexity

2791
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,719
science i mean there's a million ways in

2792
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:12,960
which this is kind of funny because it

2793
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,480
speaks to

2794
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,520
an academic hierarchy and maybe we've

2795
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,600
even met some characters who really

2796
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,000
embodied these archetypes but

2797
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,840
what are the archetypes going to be

2798
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,239
going forward what are more

2799
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,760
accessible

2800
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,199
archetypes

2801
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,119
and ones that are more true to form and

2802
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,040
they can still be funny i'm sure we'll

2803
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,159
have acting memes just enough to warm

2804
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,360
the hearth

2805
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,280
but this is just one view that kind of

2806
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,960
speaks that disciplinary hierarchy so

2807
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,920
yeah steven then blue

2808
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,239
yeah i think this this is where this

2809
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:49,119
foundational shift is this this desire

2810
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:50,880
for purity

2811
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,520
um starts has been really challenging of

2812
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,960
course now we're in this post-normal

2813
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,960
science era

2814
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,119
where you know the reality is that we're

2815
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,040
gonna have to make decisions and not

2816
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,320
just wait for the purity of the

2817
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,480
the random control trial or whatever it

2818
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,560
is to make choices so how can we be more

2819
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,920
um

2820
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,639
systematic and rigorous and so then

2821
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,880
complexity comes in and

2822
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,280
the challenges that we are facing is

2823
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,320
that a lot of psychologists and

2824
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,199
psychiatrists um have become i've also

2825
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,840
gone down the purity route in a way

2826
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,239
they're trying to like the idea is

2827
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,119
they're all trying to be more pure and

2828
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,119
the mathematician can be more pure than

2829
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:37,119
the others but that question about being

2830
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,639
more pure

2831
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:40,880
i think this is what blues

2832
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,880
points make a really good

2833
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,840
you know

2834
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,080
they come into question like physics

2835
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,239
comes into question chemistry comes into

2836
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,360
question

2837
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,840
when you talk about

2838
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,719
far from equilibrium states

2839
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,239
even the idea of it and in chemistry

2840
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,000
they call it far from equilibrium

2841
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,880
chemistry in physics they call it

2842
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,679
non-equilibrium states right

2843
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,760
um because they can actually method and

2844
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,760
the mathematicians would call it lorenz

2845
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,560
attracts estates right and but in either

2846
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,159
case you know you only have to look at

2847
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,400
lorenz attractor the whole point is you

2848
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,960
don't know where you are in it right and

2849
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,080
and not in the same way as quantum

2850
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,440
well that's the question whether you

2851
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,880
when you get into the fine details we

2852
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,880
don't know yet but it's still different

2853
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,960
to quantum right and i think

2854
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,960
that's where that quantum contextuality

2855
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,360
comes in as well so anyway what's your

2856
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,360
thoughts on that

2857
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,639
the thing that just came to mind and

2858
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:36,960
then blue is like this is a linear right

2859
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,920
it's open-ended um but

2860
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,440
sociologists

2861
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,840
and philosophers make important insights

2862
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,600
about the philosophy and history of

2863
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,639
science

2864
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:49,119
and so the mathematician can say yeah

2865
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,199
we're the most pure or we're the most

2866
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:54,320
correct or whatever it happens to be but

2867
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,040
they're nested in a sociological context

2868
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,719
in a historical in a philosophical

2869
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,040
context so

2870
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,679
it is closed from a causal closure

2871
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:05,440
perspective because it's not like

2872
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,000
physics have just broken out of

2873
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,239
the frameworks of thought

2874
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:11,040
so

2875
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,199
how to move this line

2876
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,239
into

2877
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,400
a conversation that's

2878
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,719
including all of these disciplines

2879
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,880
in a trance discipline and

2880
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,360
including people who aren't in academia

2881
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:28,080
or research in that as well blue

2882
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,600
so

2883
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,760
this is an interesting comic and i i

2884
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,520
usually like don't even talk about

2885
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,600
psychologists or sociologists because

2886
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,920
that's not science right no i'm just

2887
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,760
kidding um i really actually have a lot

2888
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,159
of respect for psychology and sociology

2889
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,600
um but it's just not something that's

2890
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,280
ever been like lumped into my pyramid

2891
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,600
before so uh thank you for for sharing

2892
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,480
that and seeing it in this way like

2893
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,239
maybe

2894
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:53,880
they should arrange by like the

2895
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,639
fundamentality of it like sociology

2896
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,280
without like social interaction

2897
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,800
we would not

2898
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,480
develop things like mathematics right

2899
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,719
like there would be no need so so in

2900
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:06,639
terms of what's more fundamental like

2901
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,360
maybe sociology is fundamental and

2902
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,960
psychology like we're not even thinking

2903
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,960
about what makes us work if we're not

2904
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,320
psychologically

2905
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,840
okay right like if we're in a bad

2906
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,280
psychological state nobody's thinking

2907
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,760
about intra cells and dna like that's

2908
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,520
there there's just no you have to have

2909
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,040
like the fundamental needs have to be

2910
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,040
met before you start to ponder things

2911
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,199
like what am i made of and how do my

2912
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,679
parts work right and and really like so

2913
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:32,480
so maybe in terms of fundamentality

2914
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,800
and then we are biology and and then you

2915
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,159
know so maybe in terms of the

2916
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,639
fundamental things sociology is the

2917
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,639
pinnacle of that

2918
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:41,520
and

2919
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,880
again there's probably many ways in

2920
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,880
which different perspectives or active

2921
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,920
inference can

2922
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,600
challenge this or at least kind of

2923
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,000
continue this joke a little bit but it's

2924
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,119
like

2925
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,080
pure active inference it's really about

2926
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,560
sociological context we really have a

2927
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,800
mathematical formalism it's really

2928
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,239
grounded in the ways that people have

2929
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:02,239
been studying physics that's one of the

2930
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:05,280
questions of 31 the paper is to what

2931
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,840
extent is it has it could it been

2932
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,400
grounded in physics but

2933
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,480
we really have physics

2934
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,960
and we really are talking about biology

2935
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,679
and for comprehensiveness and and

2936
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,760
getting to the fundamentals it is really

2937
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,400
fundamentally relational

2938
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,199
so we're not taking this reductionist

2939
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,840
purity spiral we're taking like a

2940
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,760
transdisciplinarity

2941
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,480
purity and we're just saying this is our

2942
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,600
keyword

2943
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,360
and to really get out what we're talking

2944
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,280
about we're really going to respect all

2945
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,280
of these perspectives so that's kind of

2946
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,040
a funny challenge that you wouldn't

2947
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,760
necessarily hear

2948
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,119
arising from a disciplinary conversation

2949
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:48,960
so stephen go for it

2950
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,679
yeah i think this is also one thing you

2951
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:53,520
know we say though that

2952
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,679
we see the importance of social

2953
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,360
interaction social inference and um

2954
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,679
the challenges that i think actually

2955
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,760
this might be quite apt for where we had

2956
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,880
at the beginning with maxwell's

2957
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,239
conversation is

2958
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:10,239
the perspective of the sociologist

2959
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,040
becomes what is ascribed to social

2960
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,320
interactions you know the psychologists

2961
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,560
is what's ascribing the mental models

2962
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,800
that we have in our head the biologists

2963
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,719
are ascribing the categories the chemist

2964
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:25,040
is describing the steady state you know

2965
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:25,840
so

2966
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,360
when you get into this agent-based

2967
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:31,040
modeling which again i think is is

2968
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
more familiar to the newer work in

2969
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,119
biology but it's

2970
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:36,560
something that i had to start to learn

2971
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,080
about

2972
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,639
you know and looking at these dynamics

2973
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,920
and modeling

2974
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,040
actually

2975
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,960
um

2976
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,800
starts to

2977
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,880
it starts to go under the ground of all

2978
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,400
of these

2979
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,639
in it doesn't make them invalid because

2980
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,800
they they are useful when you can take a

2981
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,440
perspective on the systemic work

2982
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,239
but

2983
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,800
we're not taking perspectives in this

2984
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,440
and there's that's the whole ground

2985
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,960
starts to become

2986
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,719
shifting um and that's really

2987
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,159
interesting

2988
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,840
okay here's another

2989
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,000
kind of a subtlety actually so

2990
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,280
um sociologists okay just starting there

2991
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,040
that's our prior you know d coming in

2992
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,679
from the left sociology is applied

2993
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:21,520
psychology okay so we're going all the

2994
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,560
way you know

2995
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,880
chemistry is applied physics

2996
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,639
it's just like

2997
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,320
it's interesting the conversation is

2998
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,000
going that way

2999
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,400
i'm just seeing another comic where it

3000
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,679
could have been like

3001
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:36,080
physics is applied math

3002
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,960
chemistry is applied physics like who is

3003
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,239
saying

3004
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,159
which field is an application of which

3005
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:44,239
other fields so there's a lot of ways

3006
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,560
that conversation could play out

3007
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,760
and by imagining the counterfactuals

3008
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,440
the semantic the rhetorical

3009
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,960
counterfactuals

3010
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,040
and then asking well what is concordant

3011
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,560
or disconcordant with our generative

3012
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,800
model and why

3013
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,159
that's a very rich starting point for

3014
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,159
transdisciplinary discussions because

3015
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,119
the whole

3016
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,440
inter meta transdisciplinary discussion

3017
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,440
it's been decades

3018
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,560
centuries truly with different words

3019
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,599
so how are we going to

3020
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,920
look at this with a new

3021
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:18,880
light

3022
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,520
and maybe even integrate some of the

3023
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,320
truly recent developments in tools

3024
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,719
like performance computing

3025
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,239
and interactive notebooks and ontologies

3026
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,239
these didn't exist one or two hundred

3027
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,560
years ago in the same way they do today

3028
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,080
so how are we going to

3029
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,639
respect qualitative and quantitative

3030
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,400
and different backgrounds recognizing

3031
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,639
that we're never going to get

3032
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,480
the end of the story even if you got 100

3033
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:47,119
phds in any one of these fields or lived

3034
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,520
100 years in a field outside of academia

3035
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,239
you still wouldn't be at the end so

3036
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,840
how are we going to take a radically

3037
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,280
different approach

3038
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,400
to

3039
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,639
learning and applying

3040
01:49:58,639 --> 01:49:59,920
maybe active inference could have

3041
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,760
something to do with it

3042
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,040
so

3043
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,000
in the last few minutes

3044
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,599
anyone else in the live chat could just

3045
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,800
ask a final question otherwise let's

3046
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,960
just um sort of recap the big

3047
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,280
aims and claims of this paper

3048
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,920
were about

3049
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,760
the foundations in statistical physics

3050
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,920
and dynamical systems theory for the

3051
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,679
free energy principle

3052
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,599
and what's on

3053
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,239
the line what's on the table for whether

3054
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,679
the theoretical underpinnings are

3055
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:35,199
adequate or not for fep and active well

3056
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:38,000
it's the practical utility as well as

3057
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,920
the theoretical adequacy

3058
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:40,880
so

3059
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,599
that's what matters

3060
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,440
they claim that their work is starting

3061
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,960
to fill in this gap

3062
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,960
and whether we think that there's any

3063
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,440
any other pebbles in that gap or the gap

3064
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,599
is uh you know a meter across or a

3065
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,560
kilometer across there is a differential

3066
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,679
and we can all positively contribute to

3067
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:01,199
that through

3068
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,440
discourse and through contributions to

3069
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,480
the literature

3070
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,280
and then the main argument of the paper

3071
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,719
and one of the big ideas that'll be

3072
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,560
really cool to talk about

3073
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,639
is that the foundations in physics allow

3074
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:14,400
the fep models

3075
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,119
to be maximally general to describe

3076
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,520
across systems

3077
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,199
but in the author's words these

3078
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:23,599
assumptions also decrease the ability of

3079
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,920
fep models to include enough factors to

3080
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:28,080
provide biologically plausible

3081
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,320
representations for living systems and

3082
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,560
the way that they are in the world

3083
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,800
so you know big idea

3084
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,400
physical and physics grounding of fep

3085
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,320
and what that says about the theoretical

3086
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,920
adequacy as well as the practical

3087
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,480
utility and then this idea of

3088
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,000
generalization

3089
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,639
and if we over generalize do we sort of

3090
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,800
leave behind some of the features that

3091
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,840
we wanted to explain in the first place

3092
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,040
so that's a little bit of the recap

3093
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,560
and i'll just

3094
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,119
pull to our kind of closing slide and

3095
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:02,960
ask these questions and then

3096
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,239
stephen and blue you can give a last

3097
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:05,199
thought

3098
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:06,400
what would a good

3099
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,080
understanding enable

3100
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,840
what are the unique predictions and the

3101
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,639
implications of this research or of what

3102
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:14,239
you thought of after learning about this

3103
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:15,280
research

3104
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,520
what are the next steps for fep and

3105
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,040
active inference

3106
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,800
what are the goals of this or your

3107
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,119
research and then what are you still

3108
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:25,520
curious about what is your intrinsic

3109
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,599
motivation that's going to keep you

3110
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:29,520
reading these papers and contributing to

3111
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,560
the discussion

3112
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,199
so stephen or blue any last thoughts

3113
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:36,080
stephen first and then

3114
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,159
i think

3115
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,199
in terms of this paper anyway i think

3116
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,040
that this really does highlight this

3117
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,639
need to understand the difference

3118
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,400
between particles

3119
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,719
voxels things systems i think this

3120
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,119
because these types of critiques keep

3121
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,400
coming up right at times i know it's

3122
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,080
it has a risk of kind of tying

3123
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,080
the free energy principle community in

3124
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,040
some knots um and uh

3125
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,880
so i think that

3126
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,040
it's a challenge and i think that that

3127
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,840
that may be a part of where this

3128
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,360
goes and

3129
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,719
at the same time i think it's a good

3130
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,320
provocation and

3131
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,639
there is some questions here

3132
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,480
about how and why those confusions arise

3133
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,280
and

3134
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:26,400
so i think that might be uh um you know

3135
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,040
i'm curious about

3136
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,960
learning more about that because i think

3137
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,639
that's going to help in other ways in

3138
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,639
doing this work

3139
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:37,840
thank you stephen blue

3140
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:38,880
so

3141
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,360
it's awesome to me i think that i'm

3142
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,040
talking about the

3143
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,920
um general general generalizability

3144
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,520
sorry that didn't come out well the

3145
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,239
generalizability and applicability of

3146
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,760
like the the

3147
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,080
free energy principle i i really like

3148
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,159
that that's also like a trade-off

3149
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,719
between like epistemic and pragmatic

3150
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:01,360
value like it reminds me of that balance

3151
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,440
that we see in the fep and and so i

3152
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,840
think like the ultimate goal is to

3153
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,159
resolve that right like how do we strike

3154
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:09,679
the balance between epistemic and

3155
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,599
pragmatic value how do we strike that

3156
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,760
balance between generalization and

3157
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,679
application

3158
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,719
great point we want to describe many

3159
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:21,679
systems and describe them well and walk

3160
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:25,119
in with a scaffold but minimal

3161
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,280
constraining priors that prevent us from

3162
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,440
seeing some fundamental or even

3163
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,800
essential attributes of systems and then

3164
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,800
that general in specific

3165
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,599
connecting that to learning and doing to

3166
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:40,639
epistemic and pragmatic values or gains

3167
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:41,920
which

3168
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,560
hint we have included in the actin

3169
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,719
