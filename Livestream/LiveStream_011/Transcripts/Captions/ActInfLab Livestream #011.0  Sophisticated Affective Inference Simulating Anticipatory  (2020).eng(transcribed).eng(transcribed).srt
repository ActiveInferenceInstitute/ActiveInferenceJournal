all right

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
i think we are live hello everyone and

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,440
welcome

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
to the active inference live stream this

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,759
is active inference live stream

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
11 it is december 16 2020

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
and there's a lot to get to today so

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
thanks for tuning in

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,640
welcome to the active inference lab

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
everyone

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,920
we are an experiment in online team

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,880
communication

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
learning and practice related to active

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,160
inference

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,280
you can find us at our website

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
on twitter as inference active at our

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,000
gmail account

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
our youtube channel or our public key

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
based team and username

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
this is a recorded and an archived live

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,239
stream

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
so please provide us feedback so we can

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,600
improve our work

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
whether during the live stream or after

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
all backgrounds and perspectives are

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,239
welcome here

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,160
and as far as video etiquette for live

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,440
streaming goes

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
mute if there's noise in your background

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
we'll always remember to use respectful

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,320
speech behavior

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,000
etc so thanks everyone just a few

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
announcements and points of process

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
there are two more meetings

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
for 2020 and they will both be from 7 30

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
to 9 00 a.m

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
pst and both of these

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
meetings are going to be about the

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
paper's sophisticated

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
affective inference simulating

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
anticipatory affective dynamics of

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,720
imagining future events a 2020 paper

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,840
from the iy

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
conference and that's what this 11.0 is

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,479
going to be primarily about

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,920
so if you're listening to this at the

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
end of 2020 then

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,320
uh we would love to have you at either

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,360
11.1

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,640
on december 22nd or 11.2 on december

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
29th

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
and also we are very happy to now

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
announce

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
for 2021

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
that's right that is going to be the

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
year 2021.

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
um we have announced our whole year's

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,880
schedule

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
so it's gonna be tuesdays from seven to

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
nine am

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
pst and all the instructions everything

know is at this link rb.gy

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
kvn pyc and just to show you what that

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,319
link looks like

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,440
it is a spreadsheet and on the top

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
is information about how to participate

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,879
in the discussion

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
so fill out this form if you want to

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
participate email us with what dates you

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,920
want to attend

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
and then we will add you to the

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,519
discussions event that day

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,120
and then if you want to collaborate

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
check out this link which i'll get to in

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,200
a second

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560
and just looking at a few of these

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
papers that we have up until the middle

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
of april

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,360
for every single paper we've been really

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
lucky enough and have an awesome

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
community of authors who want to join on

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
so we'll have an author representative

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
of every single paper

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
up through the middle of april and

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
beyond and we'll have

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
most weeks we'll have an author on so

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,159
we're going to get a lot of

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,440
opportunities to

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,280
hear from the authors about what they

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,640
were trying to do with their papers i'm

93
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
just really excited to hear from all

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
these different perspectives

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
and then of course by bringing on people

96
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
who are learning active inference or who

97
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
are from any different field

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,000
of expertise or experience we're going

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
to be able to

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
try out some new combinations that maybe

101
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
haven't been tried

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,519
speaking of the active inference lab

103
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,959
beyond the live stream

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,920
if you go to activeinference.org you'll

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,319
see

106
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
a call for collaboration for 2021

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
and this aweber slash t slash ausm3

108
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
link you'll be able to fill out a form

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
of interest and just let us know if you

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,480
might be interested in collaborating for

111
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
2021

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
because we have three main projects that

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
we're really excited to be working on

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
the first has to do with an active

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
inference book of knowledge

116
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
which is going to be like a

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
participatory and an open and a very

118
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,799
interesting

119
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,319
designed textbook reference

120
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,480
and uh source of online course material

121
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
that'll be project one

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
that's very um educational driven

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
project two is gonna be the live stream

124
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
and some other associated content types

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
that we'll get to in 2021

126
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
and then project three is going to be

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
tools for remote teams

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
so this is going to be related to the

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
frameworks

130
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
for analysis that we laid out in our

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
september 9th paper

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
um viatkin at all and um we're going to

133
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
be working on how we can do analysis

134
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
and design for remote teams so that will

135
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
be quite exciting

136
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
all right thanks for all of that sorry

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
about the relatively long

138
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
introduction here we are in active

139
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
stream 11.0

140
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
and the goal of acting stream 11 is to

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,800
set the context for

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
the next two weeks of discussion which

143
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
are 11.1

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
and 11.2 the paper that we're going to

145
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,120
be

146
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,960
reading in both of these weeks is

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
sophisticated affective inference

148
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
simulating anticipatory affective

149
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,680
dynamics of imagining future events

150
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
and that's by casper hesp at all 2020

151
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
and the researchgate link is provided

152
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
this video.0 is an introduction

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
or a context for some of these ideas

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
it's not a review

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
or a final word or a judgment the video

156
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,840
is just an attempt to contextualize some

157
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
of the ideas and the vocabulary as well

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
as some of the formalisms for the paper

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
which will be really helpful in

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
understanding the paper for people of

161
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
all backgrounds

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
the punchline of the paper is that we

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,199
can add features

164
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
to active inference such as anticipation

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,919
and affect and aiming for more powerful

166
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
simulated agents and perhaps new

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
insights for computational psychiatry so

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
we're going to be looking at it with two

169
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
main foci

170
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
one is on the simulating agents side

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
either computational agents or robots

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
the other side is sort of the human side

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,400
with

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
the computational psychiatry and how are

175
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
we going to be using this to have

176
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
insight into the human brain and mental

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
health

178
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,039
the sections of 11.0

179
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
first we will go through the keywords

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
and

181
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
that will be like a bridge or an on-ramp

182
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
for those who are from those different

183
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,680
fields

184
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
maybe learning about active inference

185
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,199
for the first time then we'll talk about

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
the aims and claims

187
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
abstract and the road map of the paper

188
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,800
how they get from a to z

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
then we'll go through the formalisms and

190
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
figures and in this paper's case

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
the formalisms are are actually drawn

192
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,120
from a few other papers

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
so this video might go a little long and

194
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
it will contain information

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
on the two uh citations that

196
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
give us sophisticated affective

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
inference which is the sophisticated

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
side and the in

199
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
the uh affective site but we'll get to

200
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
there in a few slides

201
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
in eleven and uh point one and point two

202
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,039
we will discuss this paper so if you're

203
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,919
listening

204
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
in the live chat it'd be awesome if you

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
have any comments

206
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
uh as well as in the comments after the

207
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,479
video is done

208
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,840
or if you wanna put it in a twitter

209
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
thread or however just let us know what

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,319
questions

211
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,280
we could ask the authors and also the

212
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,319
panelists on

213
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,280
11.1 and 11.2 about this paper and if

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,759
those

215
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
discussions have already happened then

216
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
keep on adding comments because the

217
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
discussion never stops

218
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
all right so the keywords the best part

219
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,240
the keywords um as usual there's so much

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,960
to say

221
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
about each of these keywords and my

222
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,240
target here

223
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
is really the construction of the

224
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
on-ramp for this paper and the on-ramp

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
for active inference

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
so if you're in the active inference

227
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,039
community

228
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
i hope that these keywords are an

229
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
invitation to

230
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
explore some adjacent areas of research

231
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,680
and if you're just

232
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
learning about active inference and you

233
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
want to familiarize yourself more

234
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
then hopefully these keywords are like

235
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
an interface or a foundation

236
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
for your understanding and if you have

237
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
any thoughts or any

238
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
questions then always just leave a

239
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
comment or get in touch with us or come

240
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
on an active inference stream

241
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,479
because we're all really just learning

242
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
these ideas at this point and so

243
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,440
we just want to hear what people think

244
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,919
about

245
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,120
what are the connections that are

246
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
possible and

247
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
certainly my hasty production of these

248
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
videos would be greatly improved

249
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,759
by people in the live chat or comments

250
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,240
just

251
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
letting us know where we could take the

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
discussion

253
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
so the keywords of the paper included

254
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,879
anticipation

255
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
counter counterfactuals affect and

256
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,879
anxiety

257
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
so maybe some of these words are more

258
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,159
common than

259
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
others people talk about anticipating

260
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
events a lot in everyday life as well as

261
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
of course anxiety and affect or

262
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,080
emotionality

263
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,839
counterfactuals you don't hear as much

264
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
about in everyday life but

265
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
maybe one does they just don't use that

266
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
word so we'll come back to that in a

267
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,240
second

268
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
all right the first term is anticipation

269
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
so anticipation is a really cool term

270
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
and there's a lot of interesting

271
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,800
research

272
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,080
and my goal here is to really draw out

273
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,040
this thread of

274
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
anticipation itself apart from for

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,720
example

276
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
systems approaches to ecology or

277
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
cybernetic approaches to action

278
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
so we're going to really focus on this

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
anticipation link and that's going to

280
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
hopefully

281
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
enrich in all of these different areas

282
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
because we're going to see how they make

283
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
this puzzle that fits together

284
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
it's bigger than all the puzzle pieces

285
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
so we're going to start on the

286
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
anticipation side with a couple of key

287
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,560
citations

288
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
which are related to robert rosen who is

289
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
in the middle of the 1900s did some very

290
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,760
influential anticipation research

291
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
and then also this 2017 paper by louie

292
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
and some other recent review papers on

293
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
rosen's work

294
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
helped contextualize this discussion for

295
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
me on anticipation

296
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
so the axiom of anticipation as they say

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
is that life is anticipatory so we've

298
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
heard of life

299
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
as a replicator we've heard of life as a

300
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,839
megantropic force locally like an

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
organizing force

302
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
and here we're going to have another

303
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
facet and that's that life is

304
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,000
anticipatory

305
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
so we're really thinking about all kinds

306
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,360
of systems just like we were thinking

307
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
about definitions of life as being

308
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
pattern making or replicating

309
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
anticipating is now going to be one of

310
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
our key features for what is life like

311
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
at least according to this lineage of

312
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,640
research

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,720
and this is going to relate to a ton of

314
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
other ideas including the counterfactual

315
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,839
which is really important

316
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
and the work of rosen and others on

317
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
anticipatory systems

318
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
led to them formalizing what an

319
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
anticipatory system was

320
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
and here was the actual diagram that

321
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,920
they used

322
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
and um again there's many perspectives

323
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,399
on anticipation the cybernetics of

324
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,120
russia

325
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
and uh non-russian non-western

326
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
anticipatory research but i'm just going

327
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
to trace out this lineage of rosen

328
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,240
for right now and certainly the concept

329
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,640
isn't

330
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
new but the systematic study of it was

331
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
new

332
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
when rosen was writing his book and so

333
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
here's a quote from the um

334
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
mathematical foundations that leads me

335
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,760
to this figure it says

336
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,000
rosen's rigorously mathematical study of

337
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
this biology inspired subject led to a

338
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,279
sequence of papers

339
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
culminating in his book anticipatory

340
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
systems philosophical mathematical and

341
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
methodological foundations

342
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
so here's the definition that is

343
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,959
provided of an anticipatory system

344
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
an anticipatory system is a natural

345
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
system that contains an

346
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
internal predictive model of itself and

347
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
of its environment

348
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
which allows it to change state at an

349
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,399
instant

350
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
in accord with the model's predictions

351
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
pertaining to a later instant

352
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
an anticipatory system's present

353
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
behavior depends upon future states or

354
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
future inputs

355
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
generated by an internal predictive

356
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
model model-based behavior or more

357
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,519
specifically

358
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
anticipatory model-based behavior is the

359
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
essence of social economic and political

360
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
activity input

361
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
and that was drawn out as this m-e-s so

362
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
it looks kind of familiar to some

363
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
diagrams we've looked at in active

364
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
stream but it's actually different

365
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
letters representing different things

366
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,560
so m is the model of the system we might

367
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
say that's like the generative model

368
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
e is the effector those are like the

369
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
action states and then

370
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
s is going to be the system or the niche

371
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and the environment includes the total

372
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
system and then the inv the effectors

373
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,320
influence the system

374
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,839
and then there's a bi-directional

375
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,040
relationship with the model and the

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
effectors

377
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,000
now um i hope this isn't too far

378
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
down the rabbit hole but i think there's

379
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
a few things that active inference and

380
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
non-active inference people

381
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
can learn from this here because um

382
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,079
again

383
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,240
it helps to distinguish which parts of

384
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
what we're talking about are related to

385
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,560
for example inactivism or which parts

386
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
are related to

387
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
bayesian computation statistics which

388
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
parts are related to thermodynamics

389
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
and by tracing out the different

390
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
lineages of thought that culminate in

391
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
what we have today

392
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,959
we can also clarify not just uh previous

393
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
ideas and realign them in the context of

394
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
active inference

395
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,440
but also we can start to potentially

396
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,360
uh work on all the systems that were

397
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,959
within the scope of these disparate

398
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,880
ideas within the scope of what we have

399
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
and so it is very important to make the

400
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
mapping and to be specific about it

401
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
rather than just say well yeah active

402
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
inference reimagines it so it's going to

403
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
be totally different well it's not going

404
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
to be totally different actually because

405
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
a lot of these figures are from the

406
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
1970s

407
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
and they're going to remind a lot of

408
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,680
active inference people about probably a

409
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,399
lot of things

410
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
things that i'm not even perceiving

411
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
which is why i put it out there for

412
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
other active inference people and none

413
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
to be thinking about

414
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
so um we saw from an activism and from

415
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
the ecological psychological domains

416
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
that we're developing in the 1900s

417
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
that there's many rich ways to think

418
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
about this

419
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,959
shared interaction or the interface

420
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
between the ecological niche and the

421
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
skilled and intentional organism

422
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,000
we also saw from multi-scale systems

423
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
complex systems that there's many ways

424
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
to think about internalism and

425
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
externalism

426
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
and about causal relationships there's

427
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
no privileged level of causation

428
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,399
or other multi-scale system approaches

429
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:50,880
okay

430
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
now we're going to focus on anticipation

431
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,160
not these other

432
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
multi-scale domains we're going to be

433
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
one domain one type of niche

434
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
what are we going to really be looking

435
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
at with anticipation

436
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,079
okay so um the

437
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,279
uh anticipation research frames this

438
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,160
world

439
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
as a multi-loop situation there are

440
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,240
simple or complex versions

441
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
that include the formers the observer's

442
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
formal model

443
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
f as well as the natural system so down

444
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,040
here on the bottom

445
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
we have f which is the formal system of

446
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,320
the

447
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,279
agent that's like internal to the agent

448
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,760
and then

449
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
we have n the actual external natural

450
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
system and so we've seen this again in

451
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,360
the context of internalism and

452
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,600
externalism and in action and inference

453
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
but here it's actually only about

454
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
anticipation that's why i think it's so

455
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,760
interesting

456
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
especially because it's actually called

457
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
inference what the agent is doing with

458
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,959
the formal model

459
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
and that's inference under a formal

460
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
model so a lot of um

461
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
hopefully connections are being made and

462
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
the idea of the anticipation research is

463
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
that we can find analogies amongst

464
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
natural systems within

465
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
rosen's holistic anticipatory ecology so

466
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
one formal system this is going to be

467
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
our formal ecology and we're going to go

468
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
out to a bunch of natural systems

469
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,399
deserts and rainforests and we're going

470
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
to be doing a decoding

471
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,800
process and by decoding the causal

472
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
entailments of the natural system

473
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
by inferring what kind of feedback loops

474
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
are uh

475
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
anticipating and being anticipated by

476
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
that system

477
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,639
which is our own loopyness over here

478
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,720
by undergoing that process we'll be able

479
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,639
to find structural relationships

480
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,240
between different natural systems so

481
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
here's natural system one and natural

482
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,239
system two

483
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
and this line of research is interesting

484
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,839
because

485
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
it introduces a basis in logical areas

486
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
as well as in category theory and

487
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,639
dynamical systems

488
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,800
so it bridges a lot of areas of

489
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,839
formalisms

490
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
and that enables this kind of law-like

491
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
and semantic or ontological addressment

492
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,519
of systems which are things that the

493
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
active inference

494
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
research frontier is also focused on

495
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
like um

496
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
is active inference a theory of

497
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
semantics and so

498
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,480
um i think there's a couple ways in

499
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,800
which

500
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,079
active inference could come to this

501
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
anticipatory framework and have some

502
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,199
insights

503
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,839
that are evaluated from active inference

504
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,480
so

505
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
first the formal model of the organism

506
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
doesn't have to be formal in any sense

507
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,759
that we traditionally understand

508
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,560
but it is something that is formalizable

509
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
or maybe it's related to the church

510
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
turing hypothesis

511
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
or there's a lot of ways to think about

512
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,920
this but active inference is pretty

513
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
vague on purpose about the exact nature

514
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,360
of this model by just saying

515
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
well it's something that we're also

516
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
inferring as an observer who can make

517
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,920
a certain kind of model so we're not

518
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,279
sure that we're on the right one

519
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
but this f is a generative model so it

520
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
doesn't have to be just an analytical or

521
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
inferential model

522
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
it's actually related to control systems

523
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,199
so here it's encoding and decoding

524
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
but we talked a lot about action and

525
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,399
about perception

526
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
so active inference more squarely places

527
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,680
this loop

528
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
not in the realm of signal and

529
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
abstraction and meaning like semiosis

530
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
but within the control theory loop of

531
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,040
system state

532
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,359
and internal states and effectors

533
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,400
um second the formal model as we've

534
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
talked about with the

535
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
internalism and externalism and tail of

536
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
two densities the internal model or the

537
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,119
formal model

538
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,679
doesn't have to be simply inside of the

539
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,319
organism

540
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,880
it can exist in this exocortex way in

541
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
this extended or embedded

542
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
and cultured or a collective way and so

543
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,119
it doesn't need to be all within the

544
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
bounds of the organism now rosen

545
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,679
probably was aware of all these tensions

546
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,720
and used

547
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
fuzzy sets and ecological thinking a lot

548
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
of other things so it's not again

549
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
i'm not really commenting on the

550
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,039
anticipation sorry anticipation research

551
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
don't know too much about it but i'm

552
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
just thinking about where we could draw

553
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,559
and build upon and

554
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
really this is so interesting that in

555
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,320
the anticipation

556
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,640
area there's a dialectic or there's a

557
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
dynamic between the formal system and

558
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
the natural system so it's almost like

559
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
natural and artificial

560
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,799
and then that's related to encoding and

561
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,320
decoding so it's framed about

562
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,440
information and about

563
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
natural communications with an unnatural

564
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
almost

565
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,280
whereas the active inference approach

566
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
takes that ecological insight

567
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,640
and connects it to control theory

568
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
cybernetics so it's action oriented

569
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
that's the action research

570
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
side as well instead of the semiotic

571
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
elements and seeing the semi-symbiosis

572
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,600
as emerging

573
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
out of action rather than seeing the

574
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
semiosis as primary

575
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520
and stimulating or signaling action

576
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,360
which one is primary well

577
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,400
which one was around first and uh

578
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,120
again really important precursor

579
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,880
research for complex systems a lot of

580
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,919
other areas

581
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,160
and just we're coming at it from

582
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
anticipation

583
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
we're not using too much active

584
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
inference jargon we're just thinking

585
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
wow if active inference could map to

586
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
anticipation then every keyword in

587
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
literature about anticipation

588
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
we could be able to be one jump away so

589
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
that's why semantic indexing of research

590
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,039
databases is so important as well

591
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,080
all right second key word

592
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
counterfactuals so counterfactuals

593
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,520
are very related to prediction and to

594
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
anticipation

595
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
and that is why um they're in this order

596
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
so many philosophers and this is drawing

597
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
from the stanford encyclopedia

598
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,520
philosophy

599
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
many philosophers have proposed uh to

600
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
analyze causal concepts in terms of

601
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,120
counter factuals

602
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
and the basic idea is that a causes c

603
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
and that's related to this claim that if

604
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,120
a had not occurred

605
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,960
c would not have occurred so that's

606
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
called the difference-making cause or

607
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
the cause that makes a difference

608
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
so it's like you imagine two worlds

609
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,919
where something happens or it doesn't

610
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,799
happen

611
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,720
and then you ask about how they'd be

612
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
different so if tomorrow

613
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
there was no sunrise in california then

614
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,480
it wouldn't be the temperature it is

615
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,039
today

616
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
so you can think about an alternate

617
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
world even one that can't happen or

618
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,039
wouldn't happen

619
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,559
and then you can talk about that and say

620
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
oh well that's because the sun causes

621
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,840
the day to get warmer when it rises or

622
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,960
when the earth rises should i say

623
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,559
and what's good about this

624
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
counterfactual is that you can go beyond

625
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
simple counterfactuals and you can

626
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
actually have quite nuanced logic

627
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,039
of counterfactuals so here was an

628
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
example from lewis 73

629
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,000
where depending on the way that more

630
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
information is added

631
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,919
uh it changes the truth value of the

632
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,280
counterfactual so

633
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
here's just an example of how that can

634
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
flip and then also how we can use logic

635
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
not going too deep but just we can use

636
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
logic to denote these sentences

637
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
so if i had shirked my duty like not um

638
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,000
signed up

639
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
when i had to no harm would have been

640
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
sued no harm would have followed so

641
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,120
if there would have been i this event i

642
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,159
then

643
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,440
not h no harm and then in b

644
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,600
we see if i had shirt my duty and you

645
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
had two so now it's kind of like the and

646
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,320
operator i

647
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
and u two events happen event i and

648
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,840
event u then

649
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,880
there would have been h and then here in

650
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,440
part c

651
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
we see i and u and part t

652
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,080
then not h and so

653
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,400
this is kind of like a formalization but

654
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
it is can also be done

655
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
in ways that are a little bit more data

656
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,600
driven

657
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
instead of formal framework driven but

658
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
it's very related to

659
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,159
so many things that we've talked about

660
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,080
like infinite grammars and

661
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
logical sequences and about the ways

662
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
that you can have a generative model

663
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,840
and then you can ask about how things

664
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,280
are based upon how things

665
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
could be in a different sense we're

666
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,320
going to of course come back to that

667
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,159
with the papers

668
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
here is where the counterfactuals come a

669
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,039
little bit more directly to inference

670
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,679
so counterfactuals in the inference case

671
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,120
are like can we understand how things

672
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
are or were by asking how things

673
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,799
could be that's purely about inference

674
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,159
and then the action

675
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
uh orientation of that question is can

676
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,159
we reduce uncertainty about future

677
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
states like can i make sure that i

678
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,720
have a good core body temperature by

679
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
asking about how things could be

680
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
so that i can choose the right actions

681
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,960
so if it gets cold later tonight

682
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
and i'm going to want to have to have a

683
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
jacket or feel warm then i might need to

684
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
get a jacket right now

685
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,520
and so that's what this paper is about

686
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,039
that's what we're going to return to in

687
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,840
precision

688
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
but let's keep it within the sort of

689
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
keyword level analysis

690
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,720
and here's a plot from uh scp from

691
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
stanford encyclopedia philosophy and

692
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
it's a strict

693
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,280
analysis so categorical of how the

694
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
antecedent what happens before

695
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
not the ant the antecedent is related to

696
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,559
what does

697
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
or does not that's what this kind of um

698
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
l means not

699
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
the consequence the consequences are

700
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
what happened after so

701
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,200
in this situation we have things that

702
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
actually happened

703
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,919
before above the above yeah the x-axis

704
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,200
and then things that didn't happen

705
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
before like you know if

706
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
the sun wouldn't have risen yesterday

707
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,799
then that's this not

708
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,039
phi that's not what happened and then

709
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
the consequences are

710
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
shown on this symmetry axis so in this

711
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,880
quadrant on the top left we have things

712
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,520
that

713
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
did happen before and they did follow so

714
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,960
this is like today

715
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
i tied my shoe and it did stay on so

716
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,679
this is sort of normal reality

717
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,240
the shaded region must be empty why

718
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,799
because

719
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,840
it's things that actually did happen in

720
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
the antecedent but didn't happen

721
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,799
in the uh consequent so this is like

722
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,200
things that where you know

723
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,039
i boiled the water but then it wasn't

724
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,480
hot or something like that like

725
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,360
something where

726
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
you did the setup correctly but then it

727
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,400
didn't occur so we know that that

728
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,039
doesn't really

729
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,840
happen and then there's this whole set

730
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,159
of

731
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,880
worlds below the x-axis which is like if

732
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
anything had been different in the past

733
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,480
if i had been wearing a different color

734
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
shirt if dot

735
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,200
dot dot all of those worlds whether

736
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
what actually happens happened or not

737
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
all of the worlds of the past

738
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,039
are accessible because they might relate

739
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,120
to a similar world outcome or not

740
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
and we can nuance this sort of

741
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,320
categorical approach

742
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
to what's called a similarity analysis

743
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
and so a similarity analysis

744
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
is where we can start with our estimate

745
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
of our current state

746
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
current moment the causal relationships

747
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
and all that sort of stuff at this

748
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,159
origin point and then with the same axes

749
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
of what did or didn't actually lead up

750
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,120
to the event

751
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,039
and then what did or actually didn't

752
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
follow from the event

753
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,840
we can have more of a continuum so

754
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
um yes there's still little shaded area

755
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
here but

756
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,400
as you get to events that are further

757
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
and further in the future

758
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,919
you get to things that potentially

759
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
there's more latitude

760
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
but the sphere is a similarity idea it's

761
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
kind of like philosophers discovering

762
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
numbers they're going from the

763
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
categories and they're like maybe it's a

764
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
one through ten scale

765
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
maybe it's a continuum maybe we could

766
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,120
take an integral over it

767
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,559
maybe we could take a derivative what

768
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,000
would all these things mean and so

769
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,960
that's kind of the

770
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,840
fruitful discussion with people who have

771
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
a quantitative and a qualitative

772
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,159
background

773
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
because the rigor of this approach which

774
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,760
is

775
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
barely scraped out with this just

776
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
summary abstract that i have

777
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
it's a lot of horsepower to plug into if

778
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
we can reconsider

779
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,679
some of these topics in terms of a more

780
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
integrative way of thinking

781
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
then we can come back to everything

782
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
about antecedent and consequent

783
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,159
and reinterpret it and re-enliven it so

784
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
that's what's really exciting about

785
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
transdisciplinary research and teams

786
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,279
hopefully not to

787
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,640
always be returning to that point though

788
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
but it's really true

789
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
all right affect so there's many usages

790
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
of the word affect just looking at the

791
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,559
dictionary definition

792
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,600
uh there was just so many and

793
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
i i found this image and i thought i

794
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,600
don't even know what to say about this

795
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,400
image

796
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
because person a has an angry emotional

797
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,320
affect

798
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
so that's like using their character

799
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
about them as their they had an affected

800
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
character

801
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,400
and then trying to hide their anger

802
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,679
person a put on

803
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,880
an affect because affect has a

804
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
uh connotation of being how other people

805
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,480
perceive your manner of speech and

806
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
affect also has a sense that means

807
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
affected like changed altered in a way

808
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,640
once he entered the room

809
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
he started speaking in a fact in an

810
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,159
affected manner

811
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,679
now doesn't really describe anything it

812
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,960
just says he did it in a different

813
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,679
manner but

814
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,799
still person a then affects affected

815
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,080
that's what this is trying to show in

816
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,400
this left cartoon i believe affected

817
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,919
person b by pushing them into the pool

818
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,320
the

819
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,520
effect of this a versus e

820
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
was that person b ended up in the pool

821
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,640
right side

822
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
so that's what i think was trying to be

823
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,320
shown was the common sense and the

824
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,360
confusion which is the

825
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,600
affect is the cause and the effect is

826
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,799
the consequence

827
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
so that's why it's interesting because

828
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,840
affect and effect

829
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,720
of course common typo but it relates to

830
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
what we just saw

831
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,039
about the uh precedent the antecedent

832
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,919
and the consequent

833
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
in terms of counterfactual structures

834
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
the world but also

835
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
affect has to do with of course

836
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
emotionality that's why we're here

837
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,279
that's what interests us

838
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,360
and so in that more classical

839
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
psychological sense

840
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
affect is considered to be related to

841
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
like emotion or experience or

842
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,120
qualia again not my area just from my

843
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,440
skimming in preparation for this video

844
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,480
and often

845
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,440
affect is displayed on these lower

846
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
dimension manifolds or axes of variation

847
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
so for example one axis might be from

848
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
relaxed to stimulated now that doesn't

849
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,880
mean feeling good or bad you can be

850
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
feeling good and relaxed or bad or tired

851
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,360
or

852
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
um here there's a mild too intense

853
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,440
so these are emotions that don't grab

854
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
your salience so much

855
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
and these are ones at the high intensity

856
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,480
that do like being astonished or being

857
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
odd or shocked

858
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,120
then there is a orthogonal so

859
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,720
at a independent angle axis on the x

860
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,120
here

861
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,039
that goes from unpleasant to pleasant

862
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
and so whether you think of it as a two

863
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
by two like there's the pleasant

864
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
and intense experiences in the top right

865
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,159
and mild and unpleasant down here being

866
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,679
a little bit too cold or something like

867
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,760
that

868
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
you can think of it in a two by two you

869
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,880
can think of it in a circle

870
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,559
you could think of it as having more

871
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
dimensions you can think of it as

872
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,480
having measurements in this phase space

873
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
so if this is

874
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
maybe the first time you've seen all the

875
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,880
emotions on a chart think about what all

876
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
the options of charts

877
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,159
are and then all the options of emotions

878
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,600
and then that's kind of what we're going

879
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,240
to be

880
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,399
getting at so not just points in space

881
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
but we could actually be talking about

882
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,679
trajectories

883
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,440
through that phase space whether it's an

884
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
emotional cascade or

885
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
a pathway to radicalization like we were

886
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,720
talking about

887
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
yesterday in um 10.2 whatever it happens

888
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,000
to be or just your

889
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
daily routine if you wake up and you're

890
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,039
here how

891
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,279
are we going to get to here this is from

892
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,640
feeling afraid

893
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
through feeling excited and happy into

894
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
content and serene

895
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
now not that this is a pathway or the

896
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
pathway or whatever

897
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,159
but perhaps if we use tools like active

898
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,000
inference or other computational

899
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
frameworks

900
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
could it be possible to introduce some

901
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
ways of thinking about this diagram that

902
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,440
would help us

903
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
actually navigate these ridges and find

904
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,200
paths find policies

905
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,440
for people who are in one area of this

906
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,240
face space

907
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
to find a trajectory into different

908
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,399
parts of that phase space

909
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,720
so they already have the phase model of

910
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
the valence and the effect

911
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,159
and then there's already this trajectory

912
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
model the fields and trajectories coming

913
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
together

914
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,760
and now we're gonna reconsider

915
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,919
and um here's just a couple citations on

916
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,039
the left about

917
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,840
non-active inference neuroscience

918
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,880
approaches to

919
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
valence and to affect

920
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
valence being positive to negative just

921
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
like an electron or a proton has like a

922
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,279
valence

923
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,919
um valence is positive to negative axis

924
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,440
so that's the x-axis here

925
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,159
it's considered to be one of the major

926
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:40,960
axes

927
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,679
of variation as people who feel good or

928
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,159
bad

929
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
or change how they feel throughout time

930
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,760
can attest to

931
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
and so again we want to think about

932
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,360
affect in a couple senses not just the

933
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,080
semantic

934
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,679
we want to think about affect as a

935
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
statistical uh

936
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,279
phenomena especially one that can be

937
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,520
studied in all kinds of animals as well

938
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,159
as in

939
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,320
even computational agents and in that

940
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
situation

941
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,919
affect as a statistical phenomena is

942
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,480
like

943
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,919
feeling greedy or feeling volatile

944
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,480
or feeling regretful or feeling

945
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,360
confident

946
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,039
these are terms that we might want to

947
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,799
apply to even a chess playing

948
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,640
statistical machine or a gambling

949
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,159
machine oh it's really

950
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
acting shy the intentional stance from

951
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,919
dennett

952
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,720
maybe that's a valid um thing to say but

953
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
the statistical sense of affect is just

954
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,919
purely the way that the system's

955
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,799
behaving

956
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,960
how would we describe its intentionality

957
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
as if

958
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,399
that's very behaviorist um very from the

959
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,360
outside

960
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,320
then there's the neuro side of affect

961
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,919
and that's related to the neuroscience

962
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,520
kind of literature that's here people

963
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,799
who are actually looking in the brain

964
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,120
for

965
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,200
electro and chemical differences and

966
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
people who have different affect and

967
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
different affect states connecting it to

968
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,399
different features

969
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,520
uh dynamical or otherwise of the brain

970
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,159
so that approach is very internalist

971
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,840
it's focused on things internal to the

972
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,720
organism

973
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,399
and it tends towards this sort of neuro

974
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,000
scientific reductionism

975
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,919
and then there's also affect in the

976
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
psychological and in the psychiatric

977
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
sense which is the experience and that's

978
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,480
where of course this whole

979
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
area this field of emotions that maybe

980
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,679
some people experience a little

981
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,960
differently than others but

982
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
no one strongly disagrees or says that

983
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
it's preferable to go on

984
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,120
this side or the other i mean that's

985
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,399
kind of the question in many ways of

986
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,679
cognitive diversity

987
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
though and this is where i believe

988
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,840
active inference comes into play

989
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
is you have the statistical behaviorist

990
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,039
could be about robots could be about

991
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,679
anything

992
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,360
you have the neuroscientific very

993
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
internalist very

994
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,200
neuro human related and then you have

995
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
the psychological psychiatric which is

996
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,399
very social

997
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,799
and very semantic and based upon the

998
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,960
clinical relationship in many cases

999
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
here's where active inference comes into

1000
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,720
play it adds in

1001
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,600
a level of computational uh

1002
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,799
computability

1003
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,720
but also philosophical agnosticism about

1004
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,679
a system

1005
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,799
that using systems engineering

1006
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,000
other approaches we're going to be able

1007
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
to talk about systems very precisely

1008
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,960
while also remaining basically agnostic

1009
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,840
on

1010
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,960
several key issues so when people

1011
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
think that some aspect of uncertainty

1012
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
in a framework is a simply negative

1013
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,360
thing it's not that i'm doing

1014
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,880
apologetics here i don't think

1015
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,799
every uncertainty is a good thing

1016
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,559
certainly not but there are several

1017
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
areas just like we discussed at the end

1018
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
of 10.2

1019
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,519
we're actually saying yeah we're using

1020
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,720
it as a tool so

1021
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
whether the person chooses to have

1022
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,120
cultural script a or cultural script b

1023
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
about this experience we're not going to

1024
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
make a value judgment on that

1025
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,279
but potentially from a purely

1026
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,880
statistical

1027
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
framework we just want to be able to

1028
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,399
describe certain kinds of behavioral

1029
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
state transition matrices being

1030
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
different in our model

1031
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,679
so that's a way where people can have a

1032
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,120
cultural experience in a personal

1033
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,000
experience

1034
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,279
but also use tools that are empowering

1035
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,480
so um also beyond the computational and

1036
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,080
the systems tractability we bring in

1037
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,279
this whole control

1038
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,679
and action perspective because all these

1039
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,559
are about thoughts

1040
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,480
you know words words words thoughts

1041
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,600
thoughts thoughts

1042
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
and rumination and overthinking and

1043
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
underthinking can also be

1044
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,399
a maladaptive state for individuals or

1045
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,600
for collectives

1046
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
so how are we going to orient this

1047
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,760
psychiatry especially in action instead

1048
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,559
of just like

1049
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,720
you're in brain state a so now we need

1050
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,799
to zap you or give you a chemical to put

1051
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,320
you into brain state b

1052
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,799
well it's not so simple or at least we

1053
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,320
haven't figured out the simple way to do

1054
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,559
it

1055
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,600
yet so how are we going to think

1056
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,080
big about the niche and the culture and

1057
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
the extended environment

1058
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,159
and then ask about how can we navigate

1059
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:44,720
this

1060
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
um you know care support team

1061
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,840
experiencer network how can we navigate

1062
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
through this landscape

1063
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
which is defined by specifics for this

1064
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
person in their situation

1065
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
how are we going to find a productive

1066
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
policy to get from here to here

1067
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,880
so those are the kinds of things that

1068
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
get me really excited

1069
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,600
because i feel like they're strong yet

1070
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,480
neutral

1071
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,599
and um powerful ways to talk about

1072
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,639
mental states and to give one example

1073
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,079
of a mental state which was a key word

1074
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,320
so i have to go into it for this section

1075
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
but um it's something that's you know in

1076
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,399
our experience is anxiety

1077
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,440
so i'm not a medical doctor of course

1078
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
and i'm not your medical doctor so this

1079
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,440
is really about that computational

1080
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
psychiatry

1081
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
perspective though um we all

1082
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,918
feel anxious we all want to help each

1083
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:36,639
other

1084
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,040
no one is alone or should feel alone so

1085
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,639
we all want to work together

1086
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
and help get you on a productive path

1087
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,280
wherever you're at

1088
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
all right so here's the definition of

1089
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,639
anxiety that's given by none other than

1090
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,839
anxiety.org

1091
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
anxiety is the mind and body's reaction

1092
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,040
to stressful

1093
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
dangerous or unfamiliar situations it is

1094
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,640
the

1095
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
sense of uneasiness distress or dread

1096
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,720
you feel before a significant event

1097
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
a certain level of anxiety helps us stay

1098
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,760
alert and aware

1099
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
but for those suffering from an anxiety

1100
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,359
disorder it feels far from normal it can

1101
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,520
be completely debilitating

1102
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,320
and in the anxiety.org literature they

1103
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,040
provide

1104
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
three different categories of anxiety

1105
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,480
disorders again

1106
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,800
this is contextualizing why we're

1107
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,240
studying this area

1108
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
as well as trying to find what are the

1109
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,320
footholds where active inference could

1110
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
start to make an impact

1111
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,320
whether in people's lives or in the

1112
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,200
biomedical

1113
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,119
system or in the health insurance system

1114
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
just where across the board are we going

1115
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,160
to see

1116
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,040
this insight take place in systems

1117
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,599
change

1118
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,839
so the three kinds of categories of

1119
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,640
anxiety that they talk about are uh

1120
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
one anxiety disorders which are general

1121
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
featured by excessive fear

1122
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,040
and anxiety kind of i don't it's a

1123
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,960
little self-explanatory but

1124
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,599
uh second category is

1125
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,320
obsessive-compulsive and related

1126
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,359
disorders

1127
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,920
which are related to obsessive intrusive

1128
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,480
thoughts

1129
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
and compulsive behaviors these behaviors

1130
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,320
are performed to alleviate anxiety

1131
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,960
associated with obsessive thoughts

1132
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,040
in their quote and then the third

1133
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,480
category is trauma

1134
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,359
and stressor related so one time or

1135
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,160
chronic

1136
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,839
stresses and all these different

1137
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,920
interacting factors that are so

1138
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,480
nuanced that is related to this third

1139
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,359
category

1140
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,720
so what to say about anxiety i mean wow

1141
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,680
so first is there's just many kinds and

1142
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,960
there's many experiences

1143
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,200
so we want to respect that everyone's

1144
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,800
having their own experience

1145
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,359
and it's going to be a totally unique

1146
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,800
experience to them

1147
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
and it will demand a personalized way to

1148
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
help them just like everyone so that was

1149
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,839
sort of the first

1150
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,320
point then there's of course to say that

1151
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,079
there's many aspects to this and there's

1152
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,359
many causes and factors

1153
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,760
just from the clustering of diagnoses

1154
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,200
that can be considered within the

1155
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,119
category of anxiety disorders

1156
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,280
according to the dsm let's say it's

1157
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
quite broad there's many

1158
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
uh features that some people might

1159
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
present with versus others and there's

1160
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,680
no clarity on the underlying

1161
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,960
neurophysiological or even situational

1162
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,320
basis

1163
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
and also it influences many kinds of

1164
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
thoughts and behaviors

1165
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
but what's a theme in anxiety and

1166
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
something that connects

1167
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,640
all these different areas is uncertainty

1168
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:18,960
is

1169
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,440
a theme and when we see the word

1170
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
uncertainty in active inference

1171
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,599
it's like a doorway because active

1172
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,800
inference is all about

1173
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
agents that are trying to reduce their

1174
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
own uncertainty

1175
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
about action in their niche so

1176
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
we see uncertainty and anxieties about

1177
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,640
uncertainty

1178
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
we want to think about how we could

1179
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
build active inference into a broader

1180
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
discussion

1181
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,839
about psychology and psychiatry so let's

1182
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,040
think about these

1183
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
different manifestations of anxiety and

1184
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
reframe them in the context of active

1185
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,720
inference and a couple of other

1186
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
topics that's partially where this paper

1187
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,800
is coming and we can start um

1188
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,440
with the uh integration of all the

1189
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,960
keywords together before we go into the

1190
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,599
paper

1191
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,400
so starting with anxiety let's go first

1192
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,720
to

1193
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,599
affect so anxiety it's either a

1194
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,400
dimension

1195
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,960
of affect or it's a point in affect but

1196
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,680
the point is

1197
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
it's someone's lived experience that

1198
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,800
they're having anxiety

1199
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,560
and specifically that they're feeling

1200
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
negative about it and they want to get

1201
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,720
better

1202
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,880
because if it's not feeling negative

1203
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,480
about it then it's not

1204
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,040
pathological that would be considered i

1205
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,119
believe within the you know

1206
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,200
realm of healthy but not suffering but

1207
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,640
if the person says puts their hands up

1208
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
and says yes i'm suffering i would like

1209
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,760
to have less anxiety

1210
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,280
that's what we're talking about in this

1211
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,040
situation

1212
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
as well as managing it for everyone

1213
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,000
whether they realize that at a

1214
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,480
metacognitive level or not

1215
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,599
the next keyword is anticipation

1216
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,400
and anxiety can be very related to

1217
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,359
anticipation

1218
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,280
which is like predictions or estimates

1219
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
for the future

1220
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
and here's one thing that we can unpack

1221
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,920
at this point as we start to turn

1222
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,599
towards more mathematical sections for

1223
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,560
the rest of the talk

1224
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,920
and it's actually that the estimate is

1225
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,440
really like a package of a couple of

1226
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,160
things

1227
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,400
it's the specific contents of the

1228
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
expectation

1229
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,800
but also it's its likelihood

1230
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
relative to other things that could

1231
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,880
happen and its confidence

1232
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,200
so that's like a way to say that we can

1233
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
separate what the prediction is from how

1234
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,240
likely it is

1235
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
and from how likely we think our

1236
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,400
prediction is going to be good

1237
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,839
and let's combine that with a few

1238
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,400
examples with the counterfactuals

1239
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
okay because i said it's how likely

1240
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,800
something is relative to other outcomes

1241
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
and that's related to the counter

1242
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,839
factuals that's related to those spheres

1243
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,440
of similarities and those similar

1244
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,920
worlds and so counterfactuals are

1245
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,760
essential for anticipation

1246
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,920
but they're also critical in the current

1247
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
moment so let's think about

1248
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
anxiety as a theme and counter factuals

1249
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,119
and anticipation

1250
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,599
and about the past present future so a

1251
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,920
counter factual about the past

1252
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
that might lead to anxiety would be like

1253
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
i wish that in the past i had done x

1254
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,200
instead of z

1255
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
or i wish i never did z you know two

1256
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,640
hours ago

1257
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,920
or 20 hours ago or 20 years ago

1258
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
and then a counterfactual about the

1259
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,119
current moment is like i wish it were

1260
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,000
like

1261
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,480
x right now instead of like z right now

1262
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,680
just i wish something were different in

1263
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,000
a state

1264
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
about the world but here's where we get

1265
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,680
those confidence estimators and the

1266
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
anticipatory systems element because we

1267
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,920
don't have to anticipate the past or the

1268
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
present that's just kind of how times

1269
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,359
arrow is funny huh

1270
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,480
but when we're talking about the future

1271
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
people don't really include these

1272
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,520
confidence estimators

1273
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
about the present they don't say i'm 100

1274
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119
confident that it's daytime

1275
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,760
they say something like it just is

1276
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,400
daytime

1277
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
but when they include something about

1278
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,240
the future it's very common to include a

1279
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
confidence estimator like

1280
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
i think it's unlikely that my friend

1281
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,319
will do x in the next three years

1282
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,520
and then you can have always predictions

1283
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
amidst other predictions so like i think

1284
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
there's a 10 chance that my baseball

1285
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,800
team wins the world series

1286
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
that means that there's a 90 chance that

1287
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
you don't think they're going to win the

1288
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,200
world series

1289
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,119
and then you could have a critique or a

1290
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,200
metacognitive estimate for your estimate

1291
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,560
like yeah i said 10 and 90. but actually

1292
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,680
i have no idea

1293
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
so it could be way way way off so you

1294
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,280
have a very loose estimate even on the

1295
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,400
10 and 90

1296
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,480
other times you're like yes i'm very

1297
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
very confident now again you could be

1298
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,800
wrong

1299
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,720
you could be way off you could be asking

1300
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,920
the wrong questions

1301
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,800
you could be you know not saving the

1302
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,680
text file

1303
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,319
so the world intervenes in ways that go

1304
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,839
beyond this model

1305
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,200
but we're thinking about just this

1306
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
simple decision-making context

1307
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,640
and so in the context of anxiety

1308
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,400
we can think about the generative model

1309
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,760
that leads to

1310
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,480
the production of affect of experience

1311
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,319
whether it's epiphenomenal or not

1312
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,760
later day but this generative model is

1313
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,800
in this strange attractor of a zone of

1314
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,079
thought and action

1315
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
and that strange attractor is whether

1316
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
it's ruminating or whether

1317
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,040
it's related to any of these other

1318
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,960
manifestations of anxiety

1319
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,800
it's like there's a strange attractor of

1320
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
thought and then

1321
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
that can be overwhelming or it can lead

1322
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,720
to negative experiences or it can lead

1323
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,760
through a trajectory that goes to

1324
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
negative places

1325
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,680
so we want to be maybe moving towards

1326
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,200
thinking about this landscape of

1327
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,119
attractors of thought and action and

1328
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,000
niche

1329
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,520
and social environment thinking about

1330
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
all these factors together and then this

1331
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,800
field of affordances

1332
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
the field of consciousness the free

1333
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,400
energy landscape

1334
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,599
how can we bring all these things

1335
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,839
together think about how to help people

1336
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,760
who are experiencing anxiety

1337
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,960
and other situations and

1338
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,359
before we go to the paper it's this

1339
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,880
slide we'll return to

1340
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
and it's what does free energy principle

1341
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
and active inference say about the

1342
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,359
relationship between agents in the world

1343
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,160
when in this case the agent is affective

1344
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,880
emotional

1345
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,520
and imaginative and here's the affective

1346
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,079
agent

1347
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,119
who's also imagining future emotions so

1348
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
this is the kind of model that we want

1349
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
to keep in mind for the paper

1350
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,079
it's about an agent who's acting in the

1351
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,599
world um

1352
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,960
and right now it's just a simple

1353
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,560
interface but you can imagine more

1354
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
nuanced interfaces at a later model

1355
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,920
and this agent is having an experience

1356
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
but that's not um a philosophical claim

1357
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,359
it's just a parameter that it's

1358
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,560
calculating

1359
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,359
and then it is also calculating

1360
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,240
perceived

1361
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,640
future likelihoods of different states

1362
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,440
okay so with no technical details at all

1363
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,839
that's what this paper is about agent in

1364
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:20,880
the world

1365
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,200
with this valence affect here it's

1366
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,359
simple it's zero to one like good to bad

1367
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:25,760
but

1368
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,480
you could go in different dimensions but

1369
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,680
here it's just

1370
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,160
good to bad agent in the world thinking

1371
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,280
about the future

1372
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
okay now it's going to get more

1373
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,760
technical

1374
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,240
that's what the paper is for though so

1375
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,319
sophisticated affect of inference

1376
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,240
simulating anticipatory affective

1377
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,160
dynamics of imagining future events

1378
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,200
it's from october 2020 so just like two

1379
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,240
months ago

1380
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,200
um at the first international workshop

1381
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,839
on active inference iy 2020

1382
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,880
at ghent and the authors are

1383
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,920
listed here so cool first annual

1384
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,560
good bold start we wish them the best of

1385
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,839
luck in their

1386
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,680
series the aims and the claims of the

1387
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,960
paper are as follows

1388
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,920
so they write in this paper we aim to

1389
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,280
provide a mechanistic account of how

1390
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,119
afflictive responses can be generated by

1391
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,880
imagined future outcomes and how this

1392
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,440
can become

1393
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,079
dysfunctional during rumination by

1394
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,960
combining

1395
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,319
two recent developments in active

1396
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,400
inference anticipation and affect

1397
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,839
we provide a formal model of these

1398
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,680
phenomena and simulate how overthinking

1399
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,040
a situation can occur

1400
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,960
continuing to the point where unlikely

1401
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,880
yet aversive and arousing situations

1402
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,000
emerge in one's

1403
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,599
imagination so interesting motivation

1404
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,560
for the paper

1405
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,000
no and in non-active inference

1406
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,880
terms i would frame this as how can we

1407
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,920
model

1408
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,319
affective and anticipatory active

1409
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,240
inference agents

1410
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,319
what features do these simulated agents

1411
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,079
display in simple environments

1412
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,160
and then because this is such a short

1413
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,720
and inter introductory paper

1414
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,400
how could we think about this being

1415
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,720
useful in the fields of psychiatry

1416
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,000
cybernetics all these different areas

1417
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,440
and of course we'll go into the

1418
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,760
formalisms soon

1419
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,920
so the abstract of the paper in this

1420
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,240
paper we combine sophisticated and deep

1421
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:16,960
parametric

1422
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,720
active inference to create an agent

1423
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
whose affective states change as a

1424
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,160
consequence of its bayesian beliefs

1425
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,720
about how

1426
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,319
possible future outcomes will affect

1427
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,560
future beliefs

1428
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,880
to achieve this we augment markov

1429
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,800
decision processes with a bayes adaptive

1430
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,560
deep temporal tree search that is guided

1431
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,920
by a free energy functional

1432
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,000
which recursively scores counterfactual

1433
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,079
futures so we're already seeing a lot of

1434
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,119
the key words come back into play

1435
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,960
our model reproduces the common

1436
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,560
phenomena of rumination

1437
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,640
over a situation until unlikely yet

1438
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,480
aversive and arousing situations emerge

1439
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
in one's imagination

1440
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,839
as a proof of concept we show how

1441
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,680
certain hyper parameters give rise to

1442
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,200
neurocognitive dynamics that

1443
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,079
characterize imagination-induced anxiety

1444
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,119
and so we're going to use the

1445
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,040
computational psychiatry definition of

1446
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,000
anxiety

1447
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,720
and uh yep it's a short abstract

1448
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
relatively short paper

1449
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
invokes a lot of formalisms and so i

1450
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,880
hope that people find it interesting

1451
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,800
the roadmap is pretty short we only have

1452
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
to go to a few gas stations on this one

1453
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,599
there's an introduction there's a

1454
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,880
methods

1455
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,119
figure one is a directed acyclic

1456
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,079
bayesian graph

1457
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,800
which we'll build up to figure two is an

1458
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
illustration of the state space of the

1459
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,960
task with all four states

1460
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,640
and then table three has a lot of

1461
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,560
formalism and it's the predictive

1462
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,160
posteriors that provide

1463
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
the empirical priors for the generative

1464
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,839
model

1465
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,880
three is the results and then there's

1466
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,240
figure three which is just

1467
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,119
an example of simulation results showing

1468
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,200
detrimental effects of overthinking

1469
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,680
so they uh made it about overthinking

1470
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,359
but they didn't overthink the complexity

1471
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,480
of the paper

1472
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
so it's a simple straightforward paper

1473
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,400
but again it invokes a lot so

1474
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,480
let's get to the formalisms and let's

1475
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,319
try to really understand them or at

1476
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:00,960
least

1477
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,920
give them a space where they can exist

1478
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
even if we don't know all the details

1479
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,680
where are the edges of the formalism

1480
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,160
so that we could be thinking about it

1481
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,839
correctly or asking the right questions

1482
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,119
or just the questions that make sense

1483
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:13,760
for us

1484
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,280
whatever they are that's the best

1485
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,359
question to ask best question to ask in

1486
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,160
a live chat

1487
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,000
best question to ask in a comment or on

1488
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,200
a live stream but

1489
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,200
definitely just ask it because someone

1490
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,640
else is going to be asking it and you'll

1491
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,160
be really helping them

1492
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,599
so formalisms here's from the paper

1493
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,640
they wrote by combining the

1494
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
ensuing recursive update scheme of

1495
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,240
sophisticated inference

1496
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,119
with deep parametric affective inference

1497
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,400
i don't have the british accent to say

1498
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,680
it the right way though

1499
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,599
we can derive a general purpose

1500
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,200
generative model of the following

1501
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,040
mathematical form summarized graphically

1502
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,839
in figure one and

1503
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,640
in tabular form in table one okay so

1504
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,880
they're combining two citations here

1505
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
and so it's worthwhile to ask what these

1506
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,160
citations were

1507
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,720
and they are sophisticated inference

1508
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,480
that's first in at all 2020 the first

1509
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,000
citation in the sentence

1510
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,960
and then there is hesp at all's paper

1511
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,800
deeply felt affect which was actually

1512
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,480
published november 30th

1513
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,400
2020 so it was a pre-print i think at

1514
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,520
the time of this one

1515
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,160
being written but then now it's been

1516
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,880
published

1517
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480
so here's how to think about this

1518
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,839
paper sophisticated affective inference

1519
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,280
that's what everyone is listening to

1520
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
this video about that's what this paper

1521
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,800
is about that's what the discussion is

1522
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,000
mostly about

1523
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
so it's combining you know building on

1524
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,200
the shoulders of other

1525
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,240
shoulders the affect side

1526
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,319
with the temporal depth side both of

1527
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,440
which we're going to go into

1528
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,680
in this video which is why it's a

1529
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,599
background video

1530
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
this paper builds on top of them another

1531
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,720
brick in the wall

1532
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,319
another uh citation in the network and

1533
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,920
we're going to be thinking about where

1534
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,760
does that go given that this was in

1535
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,200
october 2020 and it's only december 2020

1536
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
um or maybe even only a few months later

1537
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,319
if you're listening to this but where

1538
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,760
are the next places to go

1539
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,480
well there are the directions of making

1540
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,240
more advanced simulations

1541
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,000
like taking something that they took as

1542
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,359
a fixed variable

1543
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,200
in this paper and just asking if it

1544
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,040
could be a vector of variables or if it

1545
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,240
could be a continuum

1546
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,079
or if it could be another type of model

1547
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,760
inside of that and then

1548
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,200
give it a new acronym and make it

1549
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
another meme so

1550
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
what simulation directions could we go

1551
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
just purely exploring or making it

1552
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,640
more mappable to other fields then um

1553
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,040
how could we move in a way to integrate

1554
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,760
better with

1555
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,079
computational psychiatry and psychology

1556
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,160
so how can we integrate with experts and

1557
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,000
with vocabulary and

1558
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,319
key questions in those fields so that

1559
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,000
this isn't just like a machine

1560
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,400
learning parallel universe related to

1561
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,359
mental health

1562
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,040
but it's actually something that's

1563
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,559
connected to how

1564
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,720
social workers in the field or how

1565
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,079
caretakers in their

1566
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,359
daily experience relate to these topics

1567
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,160
and then another direction which i don't

1568
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,480
know

1569
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
too much about but i hope that we can

1570
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,760
have some people on to

1571
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,559
teach us more um are about new models

1572
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,680
for robotics

1573
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,720
so how do does including these kind of

1574
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,079
top level parameters like affect and

1575
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,280
in the context of a deeply uh nuanced

1576
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,760
counterfactual anticipatory model

1577
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,359
how does that relate to a robotics

1578
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,760
context and will that help you know

1579
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,599
robotic birds finally come out for

1580
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,359
public use

1581
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,280
well let's go to sophisticated inference

1582
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,720
first so again

1583
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,640
temporal depth and affect are the two

1584
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,000
pillars that we're going to build on

1585
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,520
we're going to go depth first search

1586
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,920
some of you are going to get that here

1587
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,520
is the sophisticated inference paper

1588
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,720
which we're not going to read for an

1589
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,680
active stream

1590
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,359
so i will just read the abstract

1591
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,720
active inference offers the first

1592
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,480
principal account of sentient behavior

1593
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,160
from which special and important cases

1594
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
can be derived

1595
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,720
for example reinforcement learning

1596
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,800
active learning bayes optimal inference

1597
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,559
bayes optimal design etc

1598
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,920
active inference resolves the

1599
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,000
exploration exploitation dilemma in

1600
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,920
relation to prior preferences by placing

1601
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,960
information gain

1602
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,359
on the same footing as reward or value

1603
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,240
in brief

1604
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,079
octave inference replaces value

1605
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,160
functions with functionals

1606
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,400
of bayesian beliefs in the form of an

1607
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
expected variational free energy

1608
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,760
key point in this paper we consider a

1609
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,680
sophisticated kind of active inference

1610
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,760
using a recursive form of expected

1611
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,000
free energy sophistication describes the

1612
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,760
degree to which an agent has beliefs

1613
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,880
about beliefs

1614
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,319
so higher order theories

1615
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,920
we consider agents with beliefs about

1616
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,599
the counter factual consequences of

1617
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,359
action for states of affairs and beliefs

1618
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,960
about those latent states

1619
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,640
in other words we move from simply

1620
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,240
considering beliefs about

1621
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,000
what would happen if i did that so

1622
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
that's a first degree counter factual

1623
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,720
to what would i believe about what would

1624
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,319
happen if i did that that's a second

1625
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,760
degree counter factual

1626
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,559
so for example it could be i really want

1627
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:51,359
to know about

1628
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,760
a pen's relationship to my affordance of

1629
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,240
writing but i don't know how heavy it is

1630
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,599
and so you can keep on thinking about

1631
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,160
well what should i do with my hand

1632
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
to find out how heavy it is so i can

1633
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,920
resolve my uncertainty about it being in

1634
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,720
affordance

1635
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,480
these are the kinds of nested and

1636
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,079
open-ended frameworks

1637
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,319
for cause which can be extremely

1638
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,000
contextual and ecologically

1639
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,240
conditioned we want to set up these

1640
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,160
causal chains in a ways that that we can

1641
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,520
capture them

1642
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,680
that's what this is about but the state

1643
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
space is big

1644
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,240
so a common theme we're going to come

1645
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,359
back to is like how do we look through

1646
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:23,920
these big

1647
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,280
state spaces the recursive form of the

1648
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,880
free energy functional effectively

1649
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,000
implements a deep tree search

1650
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,240
over actions and outcomes in the future

1651
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,359
crucially

1652
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,200
this search is over sequences of belief

1653
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,760
states as opposed to states per se

1654
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,200
we illustrate the competence of this

1655
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,119
scheme using numerical simulations of

1656
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,960
deep decision problems

1657
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,559
so um one way of interpreting this last

1658
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,319
part about here is this search is over

1659
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,079
sequences of belief states opposed to

1660
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,200
states per se

1661
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,520
this is really taking that full jump

1662
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,280
into the world of action instead of just

1663
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,800
inference on world states

1664
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,119
so instead of like i'm going to have all

1665
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,559
my computational power

1666
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,319
on what the temperature is going to be

1667
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,440
in california in one year from today

1668
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,520
it could be like i should just have

1669
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,079
between one and three jackets

1670
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,880
and then within an 80 20 but really more

1671
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,760
like 99

1672
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,800
1 all have the right policy

1673
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,720
but no one puts the big computational

1674
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,520
power on the jacket prediction algorithm

1675
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,359
they go on the climate prediction

1676
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,680
algorithm and there's a lot to say about

1677
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,000
that

1678
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,720
why that decision is made not in that

1679
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,160
specific case but just

1680
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,040
in general why do we go with all of our

1681
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,599
power

1682
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,079
on predicting states in the world rather

1683
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,040
than doing

1684
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,839
prediction on policy when in the end

1685
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,079
policy is like what we can control

1686
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,640
and bound and then we can leave space

1687
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,800
for the unknown we can leave space for

1688
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,760
how likely is this tsunami every once in

1689
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,920
30 years or 50 or 100

1690
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,599
what's the most resilient thing we can

1691
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,960
do right now

1692
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,200
what's the best inference on policy for

1693
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,960
our beachside

1694
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,400
community not what is the

1695
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,280
gaussian distribution of tsunami waiting

1696
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,640
times

1697
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,359
do people hopefully see a few directions

1698
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,400
in which

1699
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,160
active inference steps into these issues

1700
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,119
about uncertainty

1701
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,480
here's some of the formalisms from the

1702
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,559
paper they write our objective is to

1703
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,680
optimize beliefs

1704
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,520
so an approximate posterior over

1705
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,319
policies pi as always

1706
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,319
and their consequences which are hidden

1707
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,599
states s

1708
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,760
and those are basically s triple line

1709
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
it's like a super equal sign

1710
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,079
and it's saying s is uh related to this

1711
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:36,559
tau

1712
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,200
the t is like the tau the policy horizon

1713
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,880
so the hidden states are s from some

1714
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,599
initial state

1715
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,920
s one stay at time one until the policy

1716
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,520
horizon tau so that's the

1717
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,440
length of the prediction the depth

1718
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,720
through time

1719
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,359
um given the observations o from up

1720
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,559
until time

1721
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,720
until the current time t this

1722
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,040
optimization can be cast as minimizing

1723
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,000
a generalized free energy functional f

1724
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,880
of

1725
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,680
so it's a function of something and that

1726
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,599
function can be enormously complex like

1727
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:06,240
a neural net

1728
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,880
is like a function it's a mapping of

1729
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,720
inputs to outputs it's a map

1730
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,440
functions are maps and so f of

1731
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,400
everything it's like

1732
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,960
that's the biggest possible wormhole but

1733
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,200
that's why this is a powerful approach

1734
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,799
and then it's q of s

1735
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,799
and pi so this functional is around

1736
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,520
q which is some distribution of states

1737
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,720
and policy so

1738
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,280
the world state is like what the actual

1739
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,079
my estimate

1740
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,760
about the world's state is going to be

1741
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,359
and the pi is my policy

1742
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,359
so here's what is being asked here for

1743
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,960
those who might be learning about active

1744
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,400
inference or wanting to really

1745
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,079
go into these formalisms for perhaps

1746
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,160
even the first time

1747
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,480
this is like asking how can we have the

1748
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,440
best

1749
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,480
policy over a given time horizon

1750
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,319
so that's the big control theory

1751
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,400
question given tau

1752
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,760
and given the distribution of

1753
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,599
affordances pi

1754
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,640
what's the best pi over tau not

1755
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,319
division just what is the best pi over

1756
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,240
the time horizon tau

1757
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,040
so if my policies are left or right um

1758
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,920
in a you know

1759
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,200
a collision situation and then there's a

1760
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,240
time horizon

1761
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,079
you only have those two choices and so

1762
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,760
you can pull back to the metagame and

1763
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,079
say

1764
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,760
do i have another choice there's always

1765
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,200
space for innovation and for

1766
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,799
breaking out of the box and for

1767
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,480
reframing it but

1768
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,040
at this first base level let's just

1769
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,559
focus on

1770
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,119
a certain time horizon and a certain set

1771
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,720
of policies that are fixed so we're

1772
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,240
playing like connect four here or we're

1773
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,520
playing like backgammon it's

1774
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,559
gonna work for these models too and we

1775
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,520
wanna ask

1776
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,480
how can we estimate the consequences of

1777
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,599
pi

1778
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,400
so of our self of the policies of others

1779
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,880
and the policies of groups

1780
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,040
and the way that we're going to do that

1781
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,920
mapping

1782
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,720
rather than go infinitely deep on what

1783
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
is a causal model of the world or have

1784
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,000
every atom simulated

1785
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,440
in the world we're actually going to go

1786
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,920
to a different way and we're going to

1787
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,720
ask

1788
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,079
how are observed states related to

1789
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,040
our estimates of hidden states and how

1790
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,000
does that relate to

1791
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,880
our underlying causal model of how

1792
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,480
hidden states

1793
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,640
change through time and how our policy

1794
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,559
influences them

1795
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,880
that's the framing and there's times

1796
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,400
where you can like you know

1797
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,520
breathe as much as you want but you're

1798
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,000
not going to change by yourself the co2

1799
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,240
in the atmosphere so by modeling it this

1800
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,359
way it doesn't mean that there's going

1801
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,480
to be a way

1802
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,799
to make the estimate the agent might not

1803
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,559
be set up in a way to succeed

1804
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,799
but again it's the framing here that

1805
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,160
matters and you could frame a winning

1806
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
chess game or a losing chess game or

1807
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,240
a million pawns versus one or any board

1808
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,520
size all this

1809
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,760
can be included that's what we're using

1810
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,920
these numbers and letters for

1811
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,319
because then the pie can be really

1812
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,319
nuanced it could be

1813
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,240
a million different self-driving car

1814
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,359
parameter settings

1815
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,359
but it could be evaluated they continue

1816
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,119
this generalized free energy has two

1817
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,720
parts the first entails the generative

1818
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,000
model for state transitions

1819
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,760
given policies while the second entails

1820
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,280
a generative model for policies that

1821
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,720
depends on the final states

1822
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,520
so emitting constants so the generalized

1823
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
free energy of sophisticated inference

1824
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,359
which is deep time inference

1825
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,319
is going to have two parts one part is

1826
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,520
going to be a generative model they're

1827
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,480
both general models

1828
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,839
but they're kind of like two-stroke

1829
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,000
engine one generative model

1830
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,960
is about state transitions given

1831
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,319
policies

1832
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,839
and then the other half of the

1833
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,160
generative model is about policies

1834
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,079
given state estimates of the world

1835
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,280
and so those are manifested in

1836
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,119
q and p and they're both

1837
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,440
related to policy but they're related in

1838
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,599
really specific ways so more details are

1839
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,160
provided

1840
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,359
above this is just the um

1841
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,559
screen screenshot from the paper but

1842
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,960
we have two key equations that come at

1843
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,079
the bottom here

1844
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,440
q so mind your q's and p's just classic

1845
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,839
q is conditioned given policy

1846
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,880
it's about observations and states

1847
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,720
given policy and it's related to

1848
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,200
a model of how observations arise from

1849
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,760
states o conditioned on s

1850
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,400
and are related to another model about

1851
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:22,799
how

1852
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,920
states are conditioned on policies

1853
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,760
okay so kind of makes sense because

1854
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,599
we're conditioning here

1855
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,839
on states i'm sorry we're conditioning

1856
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:32,960
on this right side

1857
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,480
q with policy and then here on the p

1858
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,440
we're conditioning on s but then we're

1859
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,000
doing an

1860
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,480
s estimation here so we like maybe it

1861
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
kind of cancels that's how we

1862
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,640
ultimately get s on the left side here

1863
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,760
like this one

1864
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,240
somehow scoots to the left side ask a

1865
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,359
statistician

1866
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,559
but there's more nuanced layouts this is

1867
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,559
just the simple one

1868
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,720
and um it's basically related this p and

1869
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,119
q internally

1870
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,760
maybe there's another i don't see how

1871
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,240
cute

1872
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,760
i don't think it's recursively defined i

1873
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,440
think it's two components

1874
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,040
of q but let's hear the clarification

1875
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,079
from the authors

1876
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,720
then there's this p function and that is

1877
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,040
related to policy selection itself

1878
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,319
so it's not conditioned on policy p

1879
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,680
is about policy and this is related to

1880
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,880
expectations across policies

1881
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
and the free energy generalized free

1882
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,280
energy of the policy

1883
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,960
so p is like the policy selection side

1884
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,000
and q is like the inference side

1885
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,920
because this is like what are the states

1886
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,160
and the observations of the world

1887
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,680
given policy that i do given that i go

1888
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,240
on a run every day what would be the

1889
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,839
states and the observables of the world

1890
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:50,960
that would be different

1891
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,640
so it's a counterfactual but i'm framing

1892
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,160
it within this type of

1893
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,200
approach and then the other half

1894
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,359
is given that that's a likely or a

1895
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,280
possible or a preferable

1896
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,400
or a curious or a fun or a uh

1897
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
you know habit-forming whatever it

1898
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
happened to be however it fits into e

1899
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,559
and g defined

1900
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,920
formally that relates to the policy

1901
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,640
selection

1902
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,280
path that ends up getting enacted by p

1903
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,240
so

1904
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,319
yep definitely let's get some more

1905
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,839
clarification from

1906
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,880
the formalists themselves

1907
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,599
they continue with this section equation

1908
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:28,480
1.3

1909
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,760
and so here's something pretty

1910
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,520
interesting this is

1911
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,000
um they write this corresponds to a form

1912
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,760
of approximate bayesian inference

1913
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,799
i.e variational base in which equation

1914
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:39,839
1.3

1915
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,440
is iterated over factors of the mean

1916
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,440
field approximation to perform a

1917
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,119
coordinate descent or fixed point

1918
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,319
iteration

1919
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,760
so they are saying that this

1920
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,920
formalization corresponds to approximate

1921
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,119
bayesian inference i'm going to provide

1922
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,160
a little bit more information on that in

1923
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,079
a second

1924
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,119
i found that to be kind of an

1925
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,200
interesting claim and uh

1926
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,280
not sure are there mathematicians or

1927
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,559
machine learning

1928
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,720
experts who could clarify this issue

1929
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,160
that would be appreciated

1930
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,280
and here's what they wrote which i

1931
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,280
thought was really interesting

1932
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,280
sophisticated inference recovers bayes

1933
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,280
adaptive reinforcement learning in the

1934
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,319
zero temperature

1935
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,280
limit so cool because it's like saying

1936
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,160
in the extreme

1937
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,920
no noise case in some info thermodynamic

1938
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,039
way

1939
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,240
it converges to a certain type of other

1940
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,440
thing so just like

1941
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,480
some algorithms might converge to a

1942
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,319
normal distribution let's just say you

1943
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,680
sample a bunch of weights and they

1944
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,880
converge to normal

1945
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,240
this is like a convergence but it's

1946
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,559
converge this model family

1947
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,280
is converging on bayes adaptive

1948
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,720
reinforcement learning

1949
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,160
so we take all that we know about

1950
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,400
bayesian adaptive reinforcement learning

1951
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,839
all those neural nets

1952
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,400
and then now we have the best one and

1953
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,319
then it's about converging

1954
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,640
into that best funnel

1955
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,200
in a higher temperature space that's

1956
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,440
even going beyond the model parameters

1957
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,440
of those bayesian approaches

1958
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,760
quoting the authors again both

1959
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,440
approaches sophisticated inference and

1960
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,720
the bayes adaptive

1961
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,359
reinforcement learning perform belief

1962
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,079
state planning

1963
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,839
where the agent maximizes an objective

1964
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,440
function by taking into account how it

1965
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,520
expects its own beliefs to change in the

1966
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
future and evinces a degree of

1967
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,880
sophistication

1968
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,799
aka being good at chess being

1969
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:27,920
sophisticated

1970
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,559
go the key distinction is that bayes

1971
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,079
adaptive reinforcement learning

1972
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,720
considers arbitrary reward functions

1973
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,480
while sophisticated active inference

1974
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,400
optimizes an expected free energy that

1975
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,799
can be motivated from first principles

1976
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,280
key difference people who are looking

1977
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,000
for a key difference

1978
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,720
between free energy and something else

1979
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,319
that was one

1980
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,480
while both the bayesian approach and

1981
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,079
free energy can be specified for

1982
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,280
particular tasks

1983
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,039
the expected free energy additionally

1984
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,640
mandates the agent to seek out

1985
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,400
information about the world beyond what

1986
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,160
is necessary for solving a particular

1987
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,280
task

1988
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,280
so that's extremely key this goes beyond

1989
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,440
for example framing the potential value

1990
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,319
of play

1991
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,640
in terms of the estimated values of the

1992
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,760
deliverables

1993
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,760
this actually um something that we've

1994
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,680
heard so many participants on the active

1995
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,799
stream like blue

1996
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,960
and others highlight is like making

1997
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,480
space for play

1998
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,680
and this full formalization of the

1999
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,280
expected free energy

2000
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,559
it includes the information gain as well

2001
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,319
as the value driven components and some

2002
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,680
other components

2003
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,559
so actually on equal footing down to

2004
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,839
even the units of

2005
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,079
information used at least according to

2006
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,280
this first interview i

2007
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,599
listened to a couple days ago um it's on

2008
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
our one of the playlists on our channel

2009
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,720
um the same natural unit or at least the

2010
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,599
same

2011
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,440
framework whether there's a coefficient

2012
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,359
that balances them he seemed pretty

2013
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,559
negative on that but i think there could

2014
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,359
be another

2015
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,520
way that they're integrated in a more um

2016
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,400
nuanced

2017
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,319
uh way than just simply an 80 20 20 80.

2018
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,200
this isn't bipartite partitioning this

2019
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,400
isn't nature nurture

2020
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,440
1.0 this is

2021
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,839
relational causal networks and so it's

2022
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,039
going to have a really different way of

2023
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,559
phrasing it it's not going to be just a

2024
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:15,680
coefficient but it'll be

2025
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,839
like a coefficient i believe because

2026
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,200
there's systems where

2027
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,640
it is like it's 80 20 or it's 2080.

2028
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,680
in terms of delivering on um something

2029
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,400
standard

2030
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,480
versus novelty so like we talked about

2031
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,599
scripts and 10

2032
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,720
you know there's the scripts like the

2033
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,160
ritual that are meant to be carried out

2034
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,960
exactly

2035
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,880
then there's the ones that are

2036
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,760
unstructured so that whole space

2037
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,839
back to the authors this model allows

2038
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,280
inference to account for artificial

2039
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
curiosity that goes beyond reward

2040
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,200
seeking to the gathering of evidence for

2041
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,880
the agent's existence

2042
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,559
i.e its marginal likelihood this is

2043
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,480
sometimes referred to as self-evidencing

2044
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,160
and the citation there is the howie

2045
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,440
2016. and so we can think back to

2046
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,440
active inference 8 when we were thinking

2047
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,880
about that mountain car

2048
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,039
and about how it just wanted to explore

2049
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,240
but by exploring

2050
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,280
in that admittedly trivial setup

2051
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,359
it did discover the goal in the way that

2052
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,480
the optimal

2053
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,799
um reward uphill climber got ground down

2054
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,400
so how can we move beyond just one well

2055
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,359
settings move into more nuanced maybe

2056
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,440
even semantic innovation landscapes and

2057
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,359
optimization landscapes

2058
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,119
and converge to approximate bayesian

2059
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,720
inference

2060
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,200
in the truly formal case where we need

2061
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,079
to

2062
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,240
but then relax those assumptions with

2063
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,520
instrumentalism

2064
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,640
and use approximate approximate bayesian

2065
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,920
inference

2066
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,240
empirically empirically just as

2067
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,000
statisticians as scientists as policy

2068
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,720
planners

2069
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,079
that's really the question in the

2070
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,559
doorway all right another

2071
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,720
from the same sophisticated paper

2072
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,920
amortized inference

2073
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,880
effectively and also see active

2074
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,000
inference stream eight

2075
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,799
with um alec who gave us some really

2076
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,400
great information about this and

2077
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,760
hopefully we'll have alec on a future

2078
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,880
discussion as well

2079
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,799
so amortized inference is learning to

2080
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,079
infer

2081
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,240
variational autoencoders can be regarded

2082
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,079
as an instance of amortized inference if

2083
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,160
we ignore conditioning on policy

2084
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,240
clearly amortization precludes online

2085
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,520
inference

2086
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,200
that's like real time like data in the

2087
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,760
loop and as such may appear biologically

2088
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,640
implausible

2089
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,920
however it might be the case that

2090
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,000
certain brain structures learn to infer

2091
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,599
e.g the cerebellum might learn from

2092
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,359
inferential processes implemented by the

2093
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,720
cerebral cortex

2094
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,319
so this is definitely related to a

2095
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,200
neurophysiological argument for like

2096
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,559
grounding the plausibility

2097
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,720
of certain computations being performed

2098
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,920
or as if

2099
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,359
they were being performed by certain

2100
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,280
brain regions that have certain macro

2101
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,960
histological arrangement or micro

2102
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,559
histological structure

2103
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,079
sounds great um i would say

2104
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,440
in the case of insects um

2105
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,440
could we study whether they're doing it

2106
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,880
or not or i just think

2107
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,640
maybe it's simpler or it will help us

2108
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,400
realize that oh wait we don't really

2109
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,599
need the neurons to be

2110
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,280
doing that we just need to be able to

2111
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,960
think about it just like we didn't need

2112
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,160
the neuron to be doing

2113
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,000
a linear regression for us to do a

2114
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,240
linear regression across neurons

2115
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
so i don't think that using these

2116
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,000
frameworks necessarily

2117
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,880
casts the system being analyzed into the

2118
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,479
same statistical framework

2119
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,920
any more than the linear regression

2120
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,600
frame does so that's to say

2121
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,000
they all do implicitly and that's the

2122
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,759
transparent concept that's the water we

2123
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:24,799
swim in

2124
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,319
given that it's the water we swim in and

2125
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,158
there's a few different fish tanks

2126
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,000
i just don't see how using free energy

2127
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,679
on a system makes you

2128
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,359
strongly committed to that system being

2129
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,000
doing a certain thing

2130
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,560
another part that was interesting from

2131
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,920
this paper was this

2132
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,399
focus on separating the intrinsic and

2133
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,158
the extrinsic value

2134
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,759
and so there's a lot of ways that this

2135
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,560
can be broken down but basically a few

2136
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,040
cool

2137
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,198
equations so this is the divergence the

2138
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,560
kobach libra

2139
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,799
kl informational divergence which is a

2140
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,640
measure of how distant two distributions

2141
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,000
are informationally

2142
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,520
and um the kl divergence between this q

2143
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,839
and the p

2144
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:08,158
is seen as the risk

2145
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,359
and that is equal to the um like the

2146
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,479
risk of certain states

2147
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,000
like whether the red light is going to

2148
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,679
signal something or not

2149
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,040
and then um the equal sign

2150
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,520
on the other side there's risk in terms

2151
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,719
of the outcomes

2152
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,080
so here's s condition on pi here's o

2153
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,759
condition on pi and then here it's p of

2154
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,198
s instead of p of o

2155
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,839
so this is a divergence from the

2156
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,158
observations

2157
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,600
given the outcome so this is like the

2158
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,759
this q is about observations p is about

2159
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:38,560
observations

2160
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,040
and it's condition on policy so this is

2161
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,799
divergence in states

2162
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:47,600
divergence in outcomes plus expectations

2163
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,640
this is about q of observations being

2164
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,759
conditioned on policy

2165
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,359
so we're kind of functionalizing and

2166
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,840
conditionally conditioning on a lot

2167
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,120
but this is actually about the states

2168
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,040
and this is about the states given the

2169
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,960
observations and the policy

2170
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,760
and how that is bringing us close to

2171
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,719
what

2172
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,320
the mapping between states and

2173
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,560
observations which is the interesting

2174
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,120
part

2175
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,800
and so there's so much to say here but

2176
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,960
they unpack it in terms of the intrinsic

2177
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,760
and the extrinsic value so there's

2178
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,800
basically

2179
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,080
this um separate sections

2180
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,920
i would just say not just in the

2181
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,199
interest of time but

2182
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,640
just in the interest of knowing that

2183
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,600
these formalisms really demand to be

2184
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,920
unpacked and mapped in a really formal

2185
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,640
way

2186
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,600
not just discussed in an introductory

2187
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,199
lecture so let's save them for another

2188
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,239
time

2189
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,000
as far as the general and the specific

2190
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,440
cases of this

2191
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,159
there's a nice figure here with a few

2192
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,159
different special cases that descend

2193
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,440
into certain uh different sub areas

2194
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,920
so if there's no prior this is like an

2195
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,800
uninformed or

2196
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,840
optimally uninformed bayesian design so

2197
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,600
that's the information maximization

2198
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,320
principle

2199
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,280
that's info gain if we have no ambiguity

2200
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,199
like if the

2201
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,760
prediction can be completely perfect as

2202
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,679
far as the observations are concerned

2203
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,840
like all the thermometers are perfect in

2204
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,760
your building for example

2205
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,320
then you can have basically risk

2206
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,080
sensitive or aware policies that's like

2207
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,360
cybernetics

2208
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,840
as well as informational control and

2209
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,400
kind of

2210
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,400
occam's principle i'd be really curious

2211
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,159
to learn what they meant here

2212
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,800
but maybe that means like argument by

2213
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,679
simplicity

2214
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,000
in the context of systems engineering

2215
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,719
could be pretty interesting

2216
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,760
then if there's no intrinsic value so if

2217
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,800
it's just pure curiosity um search pure

2218
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,320
exploration search

2219
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,120
then it can it can converge depending on

2220
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
how you value

2221
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,880
intrinsic versus extrinsic to a variety

2222
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,080
of different

2223
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,400
types of theory and then also there's

2224
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,760
this maximum entropy

2225
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,280
which i would also like to learn more

2226
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,440
about from the authors about

2227
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,199
no ambiguity or prior so i'm kind of

2228
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,560
curious how these two

2229
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,280
no priors and no ambiguity how does that

2230
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,120
relate to the no ambiguity of priors and

2231
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,880
then is there one that doesn't have any

2232
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,800
with no intrinsic value either like what

2233
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,120
happens when you have nothing

2234
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,199
all right and this one is going to come

2235
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,360
back in a very very similar

2236
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,560
format in the

2237
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,719
figures for the paper but basically it

2238
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:19,840
starts off

2239
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,080
and it's like here's us at the top at

2240
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,000
observation time point three

2241
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,080
and then there's one two three four

2242
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,600
things can happen

2243
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,440
and then from thing one or three

2244
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,679
happening four things could

2245
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,880
be observed and then from one or three

2246
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,040
of those or from two or four

2247
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,440
then you can have one two three four

2248
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,239
things happen

2249
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,480
and here outcome one and two and four

2250
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,440
lead to one of four observations and so

2251
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:47,840
this

2252
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,159
is like an unrolling this is like a roll

2253
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,840
out of a deep time prediction

2254
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,320
on a tree and that's related to a couple

2255
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,520
different ideas which is why we

2256
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,480
introduce them

2257
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,239
which is the prediction through

2258
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,520
recursion

2259
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,920
and the counter factual branching so the

2260
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,120
first thing to remember is that the

2261
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
branches are literally counter factuals

2262
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,000
it's like

2263
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,920
what would my prediction be but it's

2264
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,960
really just predicting the whole

2265
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,760
distribution

2266
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,600
so instead of thinking as predicting is

2267
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,679
my team going to win or not just think

2268
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,520
what is the distribution of likelihoods

2269
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,679
of each team winning the world series

2270
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,520
and then that's like what is the

2271
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,120
likelihood of each of these outcomes

2272
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,320
conditioned on this

2273
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,760
and you keep on conditioning on

2274
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,199
conditioning on and rolling that out

2275
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,640
through deep time

2276
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,800
so it relates to counter factuals and

2277
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,760
the state

2278
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,640
outcome mapping so state of the world

2279
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,400
and then mapped onto your observations

2280
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,199
the sensory outcomes through this

2281
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,800
learning of the relationship

2282
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,560
so here is what it looks like in the

2283
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,080
format that we looked at at the end of

2284
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,360
10.2

2285
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,360
you have b the transition matrix it's

2286
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,400
like there's a state

2287
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,920
it emits observation it's this dark kind

2288
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,679
then there's a an action policy

2289
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,360
whether from the agent or from and or

2290
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,800
from the world and that

2291
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,480
modifies or not the state transition

2292
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,159
matrix and then the state

2293
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,000
goes to the next state and then through

2294
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,840
a which can be similar or not

2295
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
it emits another observation that could

2296
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,520
be probabilistic or not

2297
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
so we're going to see this again in just

2298
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,640
a few slides but

2299
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,080
pretty interesting and that's just the

2300
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,600
first approach and that shows that the

2301
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,120
sophisticated inference paper was the

2302
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,800
one that really brought it out

2303
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,120
and then also this is pretty interesting

2304
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,080
figure eight and here's the caption

2305
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,760
this schematic summarizes the various

2306
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,840
imperatives implied by minimizing a free

2307
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,679
energy functional of posterior beliefs

2308
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:28,800
about policies

2309
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
ensuring states and subsequent outcomes

2310
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,320
the information diagrams in the upper

2311
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,159
panels represent the entropy of three

2312
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,199
variables

2313
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,199
where intersections correspond to shared

2314
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,199
information or mutual information

2315
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,480
so professor jim crutchfield at uc davis

2316
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,440
or anyone

2317
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,199
in your area i would love to be

2318
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,320
learning more about this question of the

2319
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,480
overlapping venn diagrams because i

2320
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,360
remember

2321
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
a lecture with some overlapping venn

2322
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,120
diagrams and information theory from

2323
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,400
professor crutchfield that was very

2324
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,840
influential for me

2325
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,440
and then the caption continues a

2326
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,520
conditional entropy corresponds to an

2327
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,360
area that precludes the variable upon

2328
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,040
which the entropy is conditioned

2329
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,040
note that because there is no note that

2330
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,560
there is no overlap between policies and

2331
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,880
outcomes that is outside hidden states

2332
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,239
this is because hidden states form a

2333
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,239
markov blanket i.e informational

2334
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,640
bottleneck between policies and outcomes

2335
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,719
two complementary two complementary

2336
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,480
formulations of minimizing expected free

2337
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,920
energy are shown on the right in terms

2338
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,480
of risk

2339
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,280
and ambiguity

2340
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,960
and left in terms of information gain in

2341
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,000
entropy

2342
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,920
respectively one can see that both will

2343
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,679
tend to increase the overlap

2344
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,280
of mutual information between hidden

2345
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,040
states and outputs that's what we really

2346
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,760
want

2347
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,640
is we want the states and the outputs we

2348
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,360
want to be

2349
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,719
learning that relationship

2350
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,400
both will tend to increase the overlap

2351
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,760
of mutual information between hidden

2352
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,199
states and outputs while minimizing

2353
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,800
entropy or bayesian risk

2354
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,480
in these diagrams we have assumed steady

2355
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,400
state such that risk becomes the mutual

2356
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,080
information between policies and hidden

2357
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:58,880
states

2358
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,159
for simplicity we have omitted

2359
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,560
dependencies on initial observations

2360
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,960
fair the various schemes or formulations

2361
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,239
considered in the text are shown on the

2362
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:06,719
bottom

2363
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,400
these demonstrated the bayesian control

2364
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,560
theory iekl control and bayesian risk

2365
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
and optimal bayesian denying

2366
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,640
an optimal beijing design figures

2367
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,239
complementary imperatives

2368
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,760
okay bayesian design of what

2369
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,560
the answer is of experiments so this is

2370
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,640
optimal experimentation

2371
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,360
conditioned on everything you know okay

2372
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,400
so this is like

2373
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,520
given the state of what's known how can

2374
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,440
you get information gained

2375
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,080
and then here is related to

2376
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,600
making uh the lowest possible risk

2377
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,400
through policy given to the states that

2378
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,600
are known

2379
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,360
and that's related to what's known as kl

2380
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,719
control

2381
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,840
and so what we're seeing here is in this

2382
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,320
mapping

2383
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,239
of active inference and not necessarily

2384
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,920
other frameworks

2385
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,920
i'd be open to correction or expansion

2386
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,679
on this but not necessarily in other

2387
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:00,960
frameworks

2388
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,480
are there um such even ways

2389
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,120
to understand and equivocate a really

2390
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:07,600
broad

2391
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,000
range of strategies for example you

2392
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,800
could do

2393
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,560
really this is kind of like explore and

2394
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,880
this is kind of like exploit

2395
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
except instead of the parameter

2396
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,199
switching explore to exploit

2397
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,159
or one mode to the other it's actually

2398
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,320
like a more nuanced trade-off

2399
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,600
mediated through policy and

2400
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,640
what that policy is enacting in is

2401
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,760
a co-optimization of

2402
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,640
information gain that's this outward and

2403
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,640
it's expansive in this variational

2404
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,080
principle with the downward

2405
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,120
coordinating bayesian risk precision

2406
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,560
optimization

2407
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,239
so the bayesian design is like you're on

2408
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,679
this point on this uh

2409
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,679
you know wherever you're at and it's

2410
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,920
expanding outwards with the info gain

2411
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,840
with the optimal experimentation and

2412
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,199
then it's collapsing inwards

2413
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,320
in order to decrease surprise about the

2414
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,400
world

2415
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,080
all right now on

2416
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,679
april 6th and 13th 2021

2417
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,960
casper hesp and other authors from this

2418
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,960
recently published paper will be joining

2419
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,320
the active stream

2420
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,600
so we'll go through the paper and all

2421
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,040
the figures and everything

2422
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,840
then but

2423
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,520
the figures will just go through it one

2424
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,040
first time because they're going to be

2425
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,880
basically exactly copied over

2426
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
for the sophisticated affect of

2427
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,000
inference so

2428
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
where we start is m1 and we'll go

2429
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,560
through these pretty fast

2430
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,640
m1 the first layer of the model is about

2431
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,480
how hidden states instantaneously are

2432
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,239
associated with observations

2433
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,080
so here's observations here's a

2434
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,920
likelihood mapping here's the states

2435
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,320
we're

2436
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,080
estimating states given our prior d

2437
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,920
and then from observations through the

2438
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,440
likelihood mapping a

2439
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,880
some math now m2

2440
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,360
is a generative model of anticipation so

2441
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:01,920
here

2442
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,560
we have d our initial priors and then we

2443
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,920
have b which is how d

2444
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,400
changes basically how those those priors

2445
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,360
change

2446
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,120
and then we have states through time one

2447
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,080
two three and then at each time

2448
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,960
we're having either a prediction or a

2449
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,960
confirmation or updating

2450
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,199
of an observation that's the time

2451
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,360
specific predictive density

2452
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,000
so m2 is like how does m1 which is at

2453
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,120
one time point

2454
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,199
change over two or more time points so

2455
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,600
that's m2

2456
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,000
m3 is a generative model of action so

2457
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
this is where we introduce the action

2458
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,880
layer and so there's a couple of pieces

2459
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,080
that play into it

2460
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,199
the first thing to notice is that we

2461
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,600
have this exact same m2

2462
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,760
it's literally it's um the exact same

2463
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,760
image copied out here's m2

2464
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,760
looks kind of like three letters there's

2465
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,600
three prongs pointing down and a little

2466
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,560
head with the d same exact shape here

2467
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,960
okay so m2 the box is clarifying this is

2468
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,840
the exact same

2469
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
m2 that we just talked about m3 is

2470
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,880
around that

2471
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,080
and so how does m3 come into play

2472
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,920
well it's all about pi policy and so

2473
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,040
p policy plays into the b

2474
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,800
matrix which is how the state

2475
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,120
estimate changes through time so our

2476
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,199
policy is really if i exercise every day

2477
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,280
then i'll be getting healthier in this

2478
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,159
way so something like that

2479
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,800
and the pi is again only playing into

2480
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,639
these b matrices it's not playing into

2481
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:29,280
the s

2482
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,280
state estimation it's not playing into

2483
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,280
any a matrix learning it's a different

2484
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,400
part of the brain different part of the

2485
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:34,880
model

2486
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,920
or so they say maybe and

2487
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,120
the pi reaches downwards into the b

2488
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,920
but also it's getting influenced by a

2489
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,679
couple of new things up here

2490
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,520
which is the baseline prior over

2491
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,719
policies

2492
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,360
and the phenotypic outcome preferences

2493
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,480
which are c so c

2494
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,120
is your preference matrix e is like your

2495
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,239
affordances

2496
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,840
that's like your your baseline

2497
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,480
affordances of your prior of affordances

2498
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,080
just like um endowed from evolution

2499
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,480
and from learning and development what

2500
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,520
are the tools

2501
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,639
that are at the disposal and then

2502
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,320
there's the phenotypic preferences which

2503
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,400
are also evolutionary priors that can be

2504
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,120
updated

2505
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,239
and they can be contextual and through g

2506
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,880
there's a policy selection okay more

2507
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,320
math or math but

2508
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,840
it's about d this internal model of how

2509
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,000
states and observations are linked and

2510
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,600
then we're going to hook

2511
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,639
p pi policy in here

2512
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,760
through using this g free energy

2513
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,360
optimizing function then

2514
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,960
g is the interface for

2515
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,120
where this generative model of implicit

2516
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,040
metacognition comes into play

2517
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,360
and so this estimation of meta

2518
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,440
confidence so remember we talked about

2519
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,040
well it's ten percent that my team is

2520
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,719
going to win the world series but i'm

2521
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,000
not too confident about

2522
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,199
that estimate and so implicitly about

2523
01:21:59,199 --> 01:21:59,840
the past

2524
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,520
present and future we speak about it in

2525
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,280
different ways but we have not just a

2526
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,880
state estimate about the world

2527
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,719
but a precision estimate like it was

2528
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,480
around 70 degrees or

2529
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,719
it was exactly 70 degrees i looked at it

2530
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,840
on a thermometer

2531
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,960
and so here gamma is this

2532
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,639
precision parameter and um

2533
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,080
beta is the prior over precision

2534
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,440
so uh it it's because

2535
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,600
beta that is the parameter i think of

2536
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,239
this gamma distribution

2537
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,199
so the gamma parameter is what is kind

2538
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,199
of the high to low temperature

2539
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:38,960
on g so it is like the explore exploit

2540
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,520
trade-off

2541
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,639
in a sense but it relates in a little

2542
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,440
bit more

2543
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,840
nuanced and and surely with a lot of

2544
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,360
different consequences

2545
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,960
um it relates to this um

2546
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,280
optimal experimentation versus precision

2547
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,239
management

2548
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,760
convergence divergence uh

2549
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,560
expansive expansive retraction and

2550
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,080
tensile and compressive

2551
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,960
tensegrity synergetics it relates to a

2552
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,280
lot of these other areas

2553
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,400
all right so to conclude that section

2554
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,320
yeah this one is a little long but it's

2555
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,800
fun and it was a fun one to learn about

2556
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,600
so um hopefully we can return to this

2557
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,320
slide now

2558
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,840
and say okay the affect um

2559
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,679
and the temporal depth are two pillars

2560
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:28,880
and now we're going to build on top of

2561
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,320
them we're going to think about an agent

2562
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,360
that goes deep

2563
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,199
and one of its predictions is about its

2564
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,760
own affect

2565
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,920
so here's the figure from the paper that

2566
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,199
we're reading from the hesp at all

2567
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,719
and the reason why i went through it in

2568
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,000
the previous section

2569
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,880
was because as you'll see it's very

2570
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,159
similar

2571
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,239
to the previous version so we have

2572
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,800
states and the a likelihood mapping

2573
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,520
states and observations of the world

2574
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,480
then

2575
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,239
we have b the matrix of how states

2576
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,280
change in the world

2577
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,880
and then we have u which is action here

2578
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,159
and u is as before interfacing only with

2579
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:10,880
b

2580
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,639
okay so that's where we've seen before

2581
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,600
but now we're going to be estimating

2582
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,199
precision

2583
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,239
and free energy at each future time

2584
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,120
point

2585
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,960
so we're going to be considering our

2586
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,960
action and our

2587
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,679
importantly our precision parameter

2588
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:31,280
which is required

2589
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,159
to calculate the g from the top we're

2590
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:34,880
going to have

2591
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,120
basically this initial condition d and

2592
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,639
then there's going to be a state

2593
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,239
that carries over into the next

2594
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,080
situation so the next branch down the

2595
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,639
row this

2596
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,000
this whole thing is gonna get copied

2597
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,280
over so you can have these big you know

2598
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,040
graphs all these recursive

2599
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,880
functions calling each other basically

2600
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,280
but this is the state

2601
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,639
and then a here um is

2602
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,040
going to be initially just giving this

2603
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,320
first state but

2604
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,159
again we're going to be at each time

2605
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,600
point rolling out

2606
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,760
in a deep sophisticated way task

2607
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,600
specific sophisticated inference as in

2608
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,280
first in 2020

2609
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,560
we're going to be doing this counter

2610
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,320
factual analysis

2611
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,199
about this deep branching and our

2612
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:13,840
precision

2613
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,840
and our valence about it at each time

2614
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,760
now here's the illustration of the state

2615
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,600
space of the task with the four states

2616
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,920
so it starts off neutral and then

2617
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,239
basically there's a transition

2618
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,480
that's possible so you can imagine a 4x4

2619
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,760
matrix with the state transition

2620
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,199
probabilities

2621
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,120
and the transition matrix that they set

2622
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,719
up

2623
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,159
has a ability to go from a neutral

2624
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,760
to a precise small gain that's two

2625
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,400
it's a good probability of getting um a

2626
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,920
good outcome

2627
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,960
or you can go to this dangerous high

2628
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,920
gain

2629
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,719
where it's mapped here i believe it has

2630
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:53,600
um

2631
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,920
the three so if you land on a one you

2632
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,199
start in the stay in the neutral

2633
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,480
position

2634
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,600
if you get to a two

2635
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,440
you can go to either one or three

2636
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,840
or they have it connected to two but i

2637
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,520
don't know if they mean that edge

2638
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,360
um properly then if you get to three

2639
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,520
you can hop to one two three or four

2640
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,800
again i don't know if they have an edge

2641
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,199
there

2642
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,320
as well and then if you get to four it's

2643
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,360
an extremely

2644
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,080
painful state and it's absorbing it only

2645
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,840
leads to itself

2646
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,679
and so here it's like a dead end so at

2647
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:28,960
the first time point let's just say

2648
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,960
we're starting at t equals one

2649
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,560
and we're just evaluating i'm in state

2650
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,320
one what could happen

2651
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,600
okay so here you could go to four now it

2652
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,480
you can't on that first one so maybe the

2653
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,199
likelihood of

2654
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,679
outcome four is zero so you're like wow

2655
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,280
all my outcomes are great

2656
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,440
i could either have this two or this

2657
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,800
three not that those are the values but

2658
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,040
you can at least say at least one

2659
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,000
road uh one down the road gain of one

2660
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,520
gain of two

2661
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,760
one step down the road both my outcomes

2662
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,719
are good

2663
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,199
then you look one level deeper and all

2664
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:02,080
of a sudden

2665
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,719
there's a few things happening first is

2666
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,159
this branch

2667
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,639
is staying very high positive all the

2668
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,639
estimates are very positive

2669
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,239
but on this branch you're starting to

2670
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,920
see that it's possible to get this

2671
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,440
negative valence

2672
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,360
so now your estimates out of these four

2673
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,719
you're like well it could be

2674
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,520
pretty good pretty good very good or

2675
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,120
kind of negative

2676
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,600
so now at each time point not only are

2677
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,639
you tracking

2678
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,560
the likelihood of different estimates

2679
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,000
but really you're tracking it as like a

2680
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,040
distribution

2681
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,040
and the distribution is about state

2682
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,120
estimates and uncertainty and

2683
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,159
the variance the prior beta gamma

2684
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,920
those are the key pieces here that's why

2685
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,360
this is so interesting

2686
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,679
and so as you can see from this

2687
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:44,400
graphical

2688
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,080
layout this kind of markov state

2689
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,440
transition matrix

2690
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,600
layout which we could see maybe in the

2691
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,600
code

2692
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,960
you can see that eventually you're going

2693
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,639
to get to four even if only one percent

2694
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,159
of the time from three to four

2695
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:57,520
you go to four if you stay in four

2696
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,120
you're always going to stay in four it's

2697
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,800
an absorbing state

2698
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,960
and so eventually if you had 100 little

2699
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,639
ants or 100 particles and they started

2700
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,239
here they'd all end up in four

2701
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,920
if you set up that way and they can't

2702
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,600
escape and so

2703
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,360
here's what we end up seeing well first

2704
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,280
before we get we see these are just the

2705
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,000
mathematics

2706
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,040
we're not going to go into it in this

2707
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,600
one but they're described there and

2708
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,120
they're described here and here

2709
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,800
and here's what you get when you do the

2710
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,520
simulation and so remember that the

2711
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,239
uh negative states were absorbing and

2712
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,040
there was just

2713
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,440
an increasing number of them and so four

2714
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,360
charts all on this time scale from zero

2715
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,639
to two thousand

2716
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,360
so the first thing to notice is that the

2717
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,159
perception

2718
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,280
of the good versus bad it starts in the

2719
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,239
middle

2720
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,880
then it goes high maybe as it's

2721
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,159
discovering some of these shallow

2722
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,480
branches where there's a lot of winds

2723
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:52,080
but then around 500 it starts to really

2724
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,159
slip down and that's in terms of how

2725
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,600
many states it's um

2726
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,199
playing out the simulation in okay

2727
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,960
and now so even though the simulation

2728
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,480
each round is totally

2729
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,159
winnable let's just say if there was any

2730
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,840
agency in the situation

2731
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
by imagining that there's an infinite or

2732
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,600
a growing number of future outcomes that

2733
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,400
are negative

2734
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,199
it leads one to have bad affect in the

2735
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,920
way that they modeled it in this model

2736
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,520
another interesting feature is that

2737
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,760
initially as evidence starts pouring in

2738
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,040
precision increases but then around the

2739
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,120
same time that the valence drops

2740
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,280
the precision drops basically as well

2741
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,440
this looks like a crypto just dying

2742
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,760
but the precision dropping here going

2743
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,639
from

2744
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,520
a high of around 1.8 to florian at 0.6

2745
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,159
that is uh showing that there's a

2746
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,480
increased variance of the estimate

2747
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,239
it's like would you rather know that

2748
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,679
you're going to have ten dollars plus or

2749
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:46,960
minus one

2750
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,440
or ten dollars plus or minus 40. it's

2751
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,320
like wait i might

2752
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,480
have negative 30 from this deal that

2753
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,920
sounds like very different maybe i'll

2754
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,920
just take 10 plus or minus 2.

2755
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,159
and so that's related to risk tolerance

2756
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,239
and design of experiments

2757
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,000
okay let's look at this bottom right and

2758
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,440
then we'll go to the top right

2759
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,880
the bottom right is the threat

2760
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,560
perception which is the fraction of

2761
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
imagined events that are negative

2762
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,840
so again at one temporal depth there's

2763
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,560
zero percent of these uh outcomes are

2764
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,440
negative

2765
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,080
because we haven't gotten there yet in

2766
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,440
this first step

2767
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,719
none of them can be negative you can't

2768
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,480
get any of the bad outcome

2769
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,360
but as more and more simulations roll

2770
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,080
out

2771
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,320
there starts to be this converging

2772
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,679
amount that are negative

2773
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,120
now here again they just called it a

2774
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,719
proof of concept but

2775
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,400
they're just showing one parameter

2776
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,159
combination so it's not a statement

2777
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:36,960
about

2778
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,320
how a certain natural system is in just

2779
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,840
any way it's a framework for thinking

2780
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,440
about it but as

2781
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,040
the threat perception increases and

2782
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,560
levels off

2783
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,840
there's also a stabilization of a

2784
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,920
uncertain predictive posterior for

2785
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,880
action

2786
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,080
so when things are good precision is

2787
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,040
high

2788
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,560
and the posterior on action is obvious

2789
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,159
so it's like very clear we're getting a

2790
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,840
lot of big winning states and there's a

2791
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,239
very low posterior for a lot of negative

2792
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,600
states

2793
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,040
then as the percentage of threats starts

2794
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,880
to increase

2795
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,040
and interestingly it's actually after it

2796
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,080
starts to get a little

2797
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,560
better but maybe the state space is just

2798
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,639
branching out even further

2799
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,159
as that happens there's a phase

2800
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,800
transition in the precision and the

2801
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,800
valence which in active inference are

2802
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,960
very tied up because anxiety

2803
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,280
which is a negative emotion we're saying

2804
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,120
in this one in excess

2805
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,920
is increased by uncertainty and so

2806
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,840
basically this is like a good level of

2807
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,800
uncertainty

2808
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,800
our posterior action was pretty we're

2809
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,239
pretty clear about which way we were

2810
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:43,600
going to be able to go

2811
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,239
but then this is like even though the

2812
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,040
green is still

2813
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,400
at sixty percent um the teal is kind of

2814
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,120
at like

2815
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,520
uh you know so the good ones are not

2816
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,400
losing

2817
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,880
most of it is actually rewarding but

2818
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,560
there's still a small fraction

2819
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,800
that are damaging but it turns out that

2820
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,199
by having that level of uncertainty

2821
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,199
it generates negative affect negative

2822
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,280
valids through this low precision of the

2823
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,719
model

2824
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,960
so that's pretty interesting in this

2825
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,400
reduced action model precision is

2826
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,520
interesting too

2827
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,920
so that's basically the figures of the

2828
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,719
paper

2829
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,800
it was relatively long but again the

2830
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,080
paper was short

2831
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,239
so i hope that you read it but at the

2832
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:25,040
same time it clearly builds so directly

2833
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,000
upon the other

2834
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,320
two work that it just didn't make sense

2835
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
to only read the formalisms from this

2836
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,199
paper

2837
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,320
when it was so linked to previous work

2838
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,560
all right so the concluding questions

2839
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,520
are just

2840
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,880
what are frameworks for affect

2841
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,679
and anticipation what would a good

2842
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,120
framework for affect or

2843
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,880
anticipation enable for us what does

2844
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
affect encompass other than valence like

2845
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,320
other than the plus minus

2846
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,159
what other features of affect are there

2847
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,560
what are some unique predictions and

2848
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,000
some experiments

2849
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,040
of this model whether in general or

2850
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,719
in the specific situation but like what

2851
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,639
is something that this model predicts

2852
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:08,400
that we might be able to go out and test

2853
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,080
or measure or already have the data to

2854
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:10,960
know

2855
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,360
and then what are the next steps for

2856
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,800
active inference

2857
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,840
how will active inference

2858
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,040
increase to another level of

2859
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,080
sophistication or include another group

2860
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,239
of researchers in the conversation

2861
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:27,199
or integrate best or emerging practices

2862
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:28,320
from another domain

2863
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,480
how can active inference grow from this

2864
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,840
encounter

2865
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,639
and serve as a you know helpful

2866
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,080
reference point for the other fields as

2867
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,040
well

2868
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,199
and then what is the goal of this

2869
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,239
research

2870
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,440
um they were mapping things onto anxiety

2871
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,880
but of course it's just a parameter and

2872
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,520
a model

2873
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,840
and certainly few authors would say that

2874
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,440
their models are anything but parameters

2875
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,159
and models

2876
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,600
yet it's so difficult to especially the

2877
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,360
multiple senses of anticipatory systems

2878
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,880
and living systems and affect in

2879
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,800
different systems robotic systems

2880
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,280
it's at the nexus where it's almost like

2881
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,000
granting

2882
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
agency to models but then removing

2883
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,600
agencies from humans

2884
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,239
so you know having affect in a model but

2885
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:10,880
then not

2886
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,880
caring about a human affect when they're

2887
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,120
telling you so that's sort of a

2888
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,639
not not of course saying that the

2889
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:18,480
authors are doing that or part of that

2890
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,679
or anything like that

2891
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,840
it's just that when we have these

2892
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,080
affective emotive agents it's like

2893
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,400
yeah that's us that's how we should be

2894
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,520
respecting people

2895
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,719
so how can we build on that

2896
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,040
and take this model which seems to be

2897
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,159
really affirmative

2898
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:37,440
about human agency and choice at the

2899
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,239
very least enabling of human agency

2900
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,119
in a way that other models again not

2901
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:43,920
that they weren't

2902
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,800
but that is different that's kind of the

2903
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,760
discussion that we

2904
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,199
are having and that's what's been so

2905
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,600
awesome so

2906
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,840
thanks for participating everyone it was

2907
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,880
kind of a fun

2908
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,320
discussion a little bit more than an

2909
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,080
hour and a half

2910
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,000
we will provide follow-up forms to the

2911
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,119
live participants

2912
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,040
so anyone's feedback suggestions

2913
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,159
questions would be

2914
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:07,520
super helpful and awesome stay

2915
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,560
in communication with us and uh

2916
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,639
yeah we hope to see you in these last

2917
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,800
two discussions of 2020

2918
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,719
and then the new 7 a.m to 9 a.m pst

2919
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,360
2021 i'm really looking forward to that

2920
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,040
i know a lot of our teammates are as

2921
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,679
well

2922
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,880
so check it out go to the website

2923
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,119
get the updated information thanks

2924
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:30,239
everyone for

2925
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,280
listening in live or replay

2926
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,760
and it was a fun discussion i hope that

2927
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,400
you

2928
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,480
got something out of it alright thanks

2929
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,839
and talk to you later
