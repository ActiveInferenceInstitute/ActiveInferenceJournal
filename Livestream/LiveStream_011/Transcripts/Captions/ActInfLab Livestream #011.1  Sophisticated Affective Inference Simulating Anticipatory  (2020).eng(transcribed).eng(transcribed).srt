welcome to the active inference lab

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
everyone the active inference lab is an

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
experiment in online team communication

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
learning and practice related to active

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
inference you can find us

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
etiquette for live streams

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
mute if there's noise in your background

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,920
raise your hands so that we can hear

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
from everybody who wants to speak

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
and we'll use respectful speech behavior

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
etc so just a couple

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880

looking ahead to some of the first

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
papers we're going to discuss

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
the first weeks of january we're going

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
to be discussing

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,399
um in 13 a paper by adam safron and

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
colin de young

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
in the second weeks of january we're

66
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
going to be talking about mel andrews

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
paper the math is not the territory so

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,840
everybody should be

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
finding exciting papers and letting us

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
know when we can read them for active

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,879
stream

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,760
also just one last note if you go to

73
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,000
activeinference.org

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
you'll see a call for a collaboration

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
for the active inference lab 2021

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
so check that out if you'd like to get

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
involved in any way

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
okay thanks for all that here we are in

79
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
active inference stream 11.1

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,400
and today first we are going to have

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
introductions and warm-up questions

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
and then we're going to turn to the

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
sections of 11.1

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
the paper we're discussing is

85
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
sophisticated affective inference

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
simulating anticipatory affective

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
dynamics of imagining future events by

88
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,400
casper hesp

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
at all in 2020 from the iy proceedings

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,879
we're going to talk about the aims and

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
claims the abstract and the roadmap

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,239
and then we'll go through the figures

93
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
and maybe even some of the citations

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
that are referenced in the paper

95
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,080
next week we're going to be discussing

96
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
the same paper so

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
save and submit your questions and get

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
in touch if you'd like to participate

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
okay here we are in the intros and

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
warm-ups

101
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
so let's introduce ourselves we can each

102
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
give a short introduction or check-in

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
and then pass to somebody

104
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,440
who hasn't spoken so i'm daniel i'm in

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,319
california

106
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,839
and i'll pass it to sasha

107
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
hi i'm sasha i'm also in california

108
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
and i will pass it to blue

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
hi i'm blue i'm based out of new mexico

110
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
i'm an independent research

111
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
consultant looking at

112
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
bioinformatics a lot and a lot of

113
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
asian-based modeling mostly

114
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
and i'll pass it to stephen hello i'm

115
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,080
stephen i'm based in

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
canada in toronto and i'm interested in

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,400
the ways active inference can help

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
inform

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
the ways groups and communities

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
understand their place in the world

121
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,439
and i will pass it over to

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
ivan let's go to alex actually

123
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,918

my name is alex i am in moscow russia

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
i'm a researcher in systems management

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,240
school

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
and i'm trying to find interconnections

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,479
and possible ways

129
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
to connect active inference with

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,479
systems engineering and system thinking

131
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,720
frameworks

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
awesome and have uh we have new fellow

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,320
gitzer

134
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,600
it could be ryan so any time that ryan

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,240
or anyone

136
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
joins we'll just hop in and go from

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
there

138
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
um okay i just want to check these

139
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,759
messages all right

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
thanks okay let's go to the warm-up

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
questions

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
so for the warm-up questions we can each

143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
just raise our hand give some thoughts

144
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
and we'll have plenty of time in today's

145
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,199
relatively small

146
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,840
discussion to get through everyone's

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,199
thoughts on the paper and on the

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,639
associated areas

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,440
so first just an introductory question

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,840
is

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
what gets you excited to read and

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
discuss this paper

153
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
so thanks everyone for showing up and

154
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
for those who are listening live and in

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
replay

156
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,039
and i'll tie that to the second question

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
as well how can we learn

158
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
and communicate the technical aspects of

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
active inference in an accessible

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
fashion so it's kind of like intention

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,800
setting

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
as we head into this relatively

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,639
technical paper

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,360
and indeed relatively technical area of

165
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,759
active

166
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
inference that draws on mathematics and

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
computer science

168
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
and a few other areas so again anyone

169
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
can raise their hand but i'll give a

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,160
first answer

171
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
just think about what's something that

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
gets you excited uh in terms of the

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
content

174
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
and then from a process-based

175
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,919
perspective what is a way that we can

176
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,120
learn and communicate

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,680
excessively so what um let's go with

178
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
steven first

179
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
well i this is interesting because i

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
think

181
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
this discussion came up on one of our

182
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
conversations on our chats i think

183
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
finding different ways in um

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
will give you different ways to

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,639
communicate to the

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
different people that you're talking to

187
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,520
so i think active inference

188
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
needs to be connected to some process

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
that people are familiar with

190
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
in terms of how they make meaning in the

191
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,039
world otherwise it's a big big

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,840
jump to build it all from first

193
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
principles

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
yes so definitely it's exciting to hear

195
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
about things that we've heard about in a

196
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,000
new

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
perspective so i agree when we see

198
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
keywords in an active inference paper

199
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,039
and we know that it's going to be like

200
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
familiar territory but approach from a

201
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
different angle that's exciting

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,560
any other thoughts there

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
alex

204
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
yeah thanks for me it was interesting

205
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
how it provided an example and

206
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,360
the case for defining

207
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
agent and generative model

208
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
for this agent and so as a result to

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,759
have

210
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
a simulation as possible ways

211
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,840
way to

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
in a practical way when we usually

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
discuss on papers here is

214
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,800
like exact case for simulation

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,440
thanks okay blue

216
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
so i think a lot of things were exciting

217
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
to me but like computational

218
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
psychiatry that's a field like what is

219
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,479
that about

220
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,120
um but i mean it really just kind of

221
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,160
hones in on

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
like maybe are we like a sum of input

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,280
output

224
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
like is our effective state like just

225
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
the direct results of our input

226
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
and if so like i don't know that it

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
feels a little bit like

228
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
brave new world-ish like are we gonna

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,560
move toward

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
you know control theory and optimization

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,840
of that

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
affective state it's kind of um just

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
like crazy and

234
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
a little bit scary to me yep from

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
implicitly

236
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
to explicitly steering others behavior

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
and valence and affect

238
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
sasha um yeah i just remember this

239
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
readings paper when it uh came out

240
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
earlier this year and thinking

241
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
like what does affect have to do

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,960
with uh agents and and why is that

243
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,160
important to model

244
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
or to include um mathematically

245
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,559
and so that's been something i'm

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,679
still thinking about um and um

247
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,958
yeah very interested in the aspects of

248
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,159
computational psychiatry and yet

249
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
i guess just on a deeper level reminds

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
us that um

251
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
affect and mood are really important

252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
aspects of the human experience and not

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
something to be

254
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,160
um ignored uh in favor of like

255
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
bigger decision aspects that it really

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
does matter

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,040
yeah one thought on that is that in

258
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
active inference

259
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
we're always talking about how

260
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
everything is prediction

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
and then we're always talking about how

262
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
prediction isn't just a point estimate

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
of what will happen

264
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
it's actually a state estimate and an

265
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
uncertainty about that estimate

266
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
so you know i predict the giants are

267
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
going to win the world series and i'm

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,640
this

269
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
certain about it or i'm not certain

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
about it so it's always the state

271
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
estimation

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
and the uncertainty and so that

273
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,959
uncertainty is the risk or the ambiguity

274
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,320
depending on the context

275
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
and then the state itself good versus

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
bad is the valence

277
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
and so it's sort of like the affect

278
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
which is multi-dimensional contains

279
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
something about how good or bad it is

280
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,120
and then orthogonally or independently

281
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
whether it's good or bad

282
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
is whether you're confident or not and

283
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
so you could be very confident

284
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
about being happy or very confident

285
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,519
about being sad

286
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,760
ryan we see you joining can you hear us

287
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
not sure while ryan is figuring out

288
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,920
his setup but thanks sasha for bringing

289
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
up the computational psychiatry angle

290
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,240
and

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
i hope that ryan will be able to fill us

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
in soon stephen

293
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
yeah i think this is a really important

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,880
point because

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
when we think about how things happen

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
over time

297
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
in this process how that gets integrated

298
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,720
how we make sense

299
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
not just in some sort of snapshot about

300
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
a situation i.e

301
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
we think this is a problem situation

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,839
and then suddenly there's this emotional

303
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,720
churn

304
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
that's somehow a byproduct of that but

305
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,079
actually

306
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
it's not a snapshot this ongoing process

307
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,360
which seems

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
incredibly impossibly complex

309
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
is made all of it's made sense of

310
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
because of affect

311
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
and emotion it's not some freudian

312
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
sort of repression that's sitting there

313
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
in the background as a as a mistake but

314
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,360
it's actually like

315
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
the big game in town which is pretty

316
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
revolutionary really

317
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
interesting and also uh yet another

318
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
transformation or sort of paradigm shift

319
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
associated with

320
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
thinking from a free energy perspective

321
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,760
is rather than prioritizing the valence

322
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,079
the plus versus minus and then having

323
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
risk or ambiguity as a secondary layer

324
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
we can actually think about the

325
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,120
ambiguity reduction as the primary drive

326
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
and then the plus and minus as falling

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
out of the quest to reduce uncertainty

328
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
rather than uncertainty being an

329
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
auxiliary factor

330
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
in the quest to improve outcomes so it

331
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
just shows how there's these two

332
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
related dimensions of prediction which

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
is the state

334
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
and the uncertainty and then we can

335
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,519
think about how

336
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,120
prioritizing one or the other is going

337
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
to lead to different outcomes ryan we

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
can see you raise your hand can you

339
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
talk

340
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
okay how about you can raise your hand

341
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
and lower it in morse code and we'll

342
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
communicate with you that way

343
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
but ryan thanks for trying and if it's

344
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
not working with your current browser

345
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
setup for whatever

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
reason today then we'll make sure to

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
work it out with you in the interim and

348
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,880
for next week and for following

349
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,680
discussions we'll

350
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,480
have you on unabated all right and

351
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
here's our

352
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
last warm-up question which is something

353
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
that you are wondering about or would

354
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,120
like to have resolved

355
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,399
by the end of today's discussion

356
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,040
blue so i don't really expect this to be

357
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,480
resolved but i wonder instead of um

358
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,959
modeling you know to predict like

359
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,399
positive or negative

360
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,079
valence like if there is a way to

361
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,120
model um like equanimity in this

362
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,519
in this sense like so neutral valence

363
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
like is that

364
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
um i mean what what would drive that

365
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,200
force and so i'm just kind of wondering

366
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
as we

367
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
dive deeper into the model if that's

368
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
going to become clear or not

369
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
can you um explain what you mean by that

370
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,079
and what other types of models might

371
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,399
exist to think about that

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
um so just like how

373
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
you know the results here were geared

374
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
obviously toward um you know pushing

375
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,680
assets towards either a positive state

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,320
or

377
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
driving away from a negative state i

378
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
mean that's i assume the idea

379
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
so what about driving toward

380
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,519
a neutral state like is is this

381
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,639
something that's been

382
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
considered right like so you know

383
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,240
overthinking tends to lead like

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,279
overthinking like

385
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,560
supposing about the future leads to

386
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
like you know these supposed negative

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,079
thoughts that and so then it's anxiety

388
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,360
producing because you're worried about

389
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
these negative thoughts like so that's

390
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
overthinking or thinking like worst case

391
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
scenario perhaps right so people do like

392
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
a lot of thought redirection

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
in this cognitive behavioral therapy

394
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
like people do thought redirection so

395
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
that maybe you're thinking

396
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,160
in not such a negative state but but in

397
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
a more positive way like well it could

398
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,360
also be great right like so

399
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
there's that but what about like the

400
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
non-thinking

401
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
so if you non-think could you lead to

402
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
like a valence neutral

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
like valence equals zero to

404
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
just have this kind of equanimity

405
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
baseline that's like

406
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
something maybe meditation meditation

407
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
achieves right so like can you can you

408
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
work towards like non-think maybe

409
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
non-thinking is that that valence

410
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,000
neutral

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
right like so i don't know how um

412
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
how can that factor into computational

413
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
psychiatry and it has that been thought

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
of before i don't know

415
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
cool great question and so it's kind of

416
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
like if we were going to be doing

417
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,560
modeling of a car there's probably a lot

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,360
of different

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
ways that you could set up car crashes

420
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,040
or cars that drive off the rails

421
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
and we just want to know about what does

422
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
it look like to have a computational

423
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
psychiatry model that isn't just

424
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
capturing a negative spiral

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
as overthinking progressively sort of

426
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,839
accelerates but rather something that

427
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,199
returns to the neutral

428
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
attractor state or something that's

429
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
related to mindfulness or attention to

430
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,839
detail

431
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,639
or abstraction but not hyper abstraction

432
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,959
rumination but not hyper rumination

433
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
so could the strange attractor be a

434
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
neutral or even a healthy one

435
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
not a delusionally positive or negative

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
stephen i suppose you could say that

437
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,920
like

438
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
there's thousands and thousands of

439
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,199
dimensions which are kind of sitting

440
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,399
there as neutral

441
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
and you really notice it when you you're

442
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,959
not there and you've got to re-establish

443
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,000
it so that's what they talk about

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
incense making is

445
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,279
when you're immersed in something you

446
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,079
don't do sense making but once you

447
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,320
suddenly jolts you out of it certain

448
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
consciously

449
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,720
you might be doing unconscious sense

450
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
making but more conscious level

451
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,440
is when you're surprised basically when

452
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
things aren't

453
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
going the way that your habitual

454
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,399
understanding of them are

455
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
and then suddenly your cognition's got

456
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
to kick in and say okay how do i

457
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
work out what is the sense of what i

458
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,839
should be doing at the moment

459
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
and that's when everything becomes

460
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
transparent so it's

461
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,839
it's quite interesting to actually then

462
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
see this now

463
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
that the again taking that that thinking

464
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,279
and

465
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,000
and that sort of abstract and bringing

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
it right into the body

467
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,160
and the and and the emotions as the kind

468
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
of like the way of really knowing

469
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
i mean in some ways is your mind

470
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
checking in with your body

471
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,040
was your body checking in with your mind

472
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
cool very interesting about the mind and

473
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
the body and always an important

474
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
take um any other thoughts here or can

475
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:20,880
we

476
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
continue sasha

477
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,279
um yeah another aspect of this paper i

478
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,000
really liked

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
is discussing the um like future

480
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
clinical applications of

481
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
understanding the mechanism of how

482
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
certain existing therapies work because

483
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,800
there's

484
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
a lot of different kinds of therapies

485
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,480
out there

486
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,440
um and namely i'm thinking of like art

487
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320
therapy

488
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
and but of course

489
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
all other forms included um to

490
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
understand to start to understand why

491
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,240
they work

492
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
and by what mechanism um they

493
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
might be tapping into uh

494
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
this kind of affective and predictive

495
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,839
coding so i think that's really exciting

496
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,319
and

497
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
i also wonder who is fit to address

498
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,119
those kinds of questions

499
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,959
is it medical professionals is it

500
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,000
psychologists um who is best suited for

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,559
that role

502
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
because um it's a very you know uh

503
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
challenging subject to talk about

504
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,599
without um

505
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,079
giving people perhaps uh incorrect

506
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,960
medical advice or

507
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
false hope and so that that's just

508
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,160
something

509
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,360
that um i'm curious about but i

510
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,799
don't want to step on any toes

511
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,559
cool let's keep that in mind and

512
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,360
as ryan joins and rejoins but no need to

513
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
send the jitsi

514
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
messages because we can hear it very

515
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,360
loudly so let's just

516
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
hope that ryan can figure it out

517
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,919
otherwise we'll take care of it for next

518
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,200
week

519
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,080
cool here we are in the paper for today

520
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
which is sophisticated affective

521
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,559
inference

522
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
simulating anticipatory affective

523
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,679
dynamics

524
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,240
of imagining future events and this was

525
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
from october 2020

526
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
in the first international workshop on

527
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
active inference or iy

528
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,520
and i believe that more recently like in

529
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
the last couple of days this has been

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
codified into a book so we're using the

531
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
researchgate version

532
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
the aims and the claims of the paper

533
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
were a bit rehearsed in

534
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
11.0 so go and check that one out if you

535
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,919
want a deeper dive into what the aims

536
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,280
and the claims were

537
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
but the big point of this paper was to

538
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,799
take two

539
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
bodies of previous work which was the

540
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
sophisticated inference which is

541
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
sophisticated meaning deep

542
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
through time and then affective

543
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
inference

544
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
affect being related to emotion and

545
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
valence and

546
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,520
fusing these two threads into

547
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
sophisticated

548
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
affective inference so deep through time

549
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,760
and

550
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,240
also involving affect and the big

551
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
question

552
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
from a non-active inference jargon

553
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
perspective is how to model

554
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
affective and anticipatory agents of

555
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,440
course we're going to be thinking about

556
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
that within the active inference

557
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,840
framework

558
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
and then we're going to be asking what

559
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
features do these simulated agents

560
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,000
display

561
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
and then how does this carry out or

562
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,360
connect to

563
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,919
areas that are like psychiatry or

564
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,679
cybernetics control theory

565
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,880
all these fun things that we've been

566
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,360
talking about in previous active streams

567
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
how are we going to connect what we're

568
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,799
learning about today something that's a

569
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,400
recent development in only the last

570
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
couple of months

571
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
this is the current developments so

572
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
let's have fun

573
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
let's um treat it as just an initial

574
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,559
inroad

575
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,160
and a connection between these two

576
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
different areas

577
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
here's the abstract and again it was

578
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
read through in 11.0

579
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,080
and we're gonna just go more discussion

580
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,799
oriented

581
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
in the panels that we have but

582
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
fundamentally in the abstract they

583
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
describe

584
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
what i just said that they combine those

585
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
two

586
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
different types of active inference

587
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
models sophisticated and deep parametric

588
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,799
models

589
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,760
and then they use a augmented markov

590
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
decision process

591
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
please know jitsi chat if possible thank

592
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
you ryan

593
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
we'll see you soon um and uh

594
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
then they give a minimal simulation at

595
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
the end

596
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
of a ruminating agent and that is where

597
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,440
blue was talking about the

598
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
negative agent that sort of spirals off

599
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,679
into negative affect

600
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,799
okay um the road map of the paper

601
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,320
there's not that many stops not that

602
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
many gas stations along the way

603
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,480
it's also a short paper and i have it in

604
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,799
this other tab if we want to

605
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
go through it as it is as a paper

606
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
because it's so clear and concise

607
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,840
but what they do is introduce the ideas

608
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,320
then

609
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
show a couple figures that just

610
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
summarize the model

611
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
and show a table with what the uh

612
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
formalisms were

613
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,679
at this point does anyone have any

614
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,720
thoughts or

615
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
where do we want to go like what was

616
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,000
something that somebody thought

617
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
structurally or from a topical

618
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
perspective that they wanted to bring up

619
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,240
or it's okay if not

620
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,360
all right let's uh look at the figures

621
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
and then use the figures

622
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
as our scaffold for kind of

623
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
understanding what they are up to in

624
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
this paper

625
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,440
and then understand why they did some of

626
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
the things that they did

627
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
and then what some of the next steps

628
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
could be so

629
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,880
here we are in figure one and figure one

630
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
does anyone wanna

631
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,200
point something out that they see first

632
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
so feel free to just raise your hand any

633
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,240
time um

634
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
in figure one i've put red boxes

635
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
around two pieces these are the two

636
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,440
pillars that things are being built upon

637
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,200
here is the affect of inference part

638
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
which we'll get to in a second and then

639
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,600
in the middle

640
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
is the task specific sophisticated

641
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
inference so that's deep inference here

642
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,919
and then as with a few other figures

643
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,600
we've seen time

644
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
is moving from left to right now

645
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,120
in this model there are several boxes

646
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
that are shaded

647
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
and that's because there's this

648
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,720
recursive embedding of the models

649
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
so we start with one single time point

650
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,720
that's this

651
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
up here on the top level of the model

652
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
this is like the outer layer of the

653
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
model it's kind of like the hour hand of

654
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,960
the model

655
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,679
you can think of and what's happening at

656
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,159
each

657
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,120
time point of the model itself is that

658
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,320
the agent

659
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,360
is doing a forecast through time so it's

660
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,159
kind of like

661
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,480
in the year 2000 you're doing a forecast

662
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,679
for the next hundred years

663
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,559
and then it's a recursive string because

664
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
at 2000 you do in 100 year prediction

665
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
and then 2001

666
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
you do 100 year prediction so it's like

667
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,240
at each time point each big hour tick of

668
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
the big model

669
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
we're going to be doing this recursive

670
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,559
uh

671
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
rolling out of predictions through time

672
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,159
so

673
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
that's the biggest structure of the

674
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
model it's top level

675
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
is the actual time that's the real

676
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
what's happening in the world we can

677
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,520
think

678
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
but then the agent is involved in this

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,840
recursive

680
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,679
anticipatory simulation and that's the

681
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,080
deep

682
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,159
or the sophisticated inference now

683
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,440
there's a few other elements to

684
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,720
highlight and again anyone can

685
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
raise their hand at any time the first

686
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,080
thing

687
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
is that within this prediction through

688
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
time

689
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
we've seen a couple elements here we've

690
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
seen s the states

691
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,480
a how the hidden state estimates are

692
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,159
mapped to observations

693
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,080
we've also seen b which is how the

694
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
states change through time or are

695
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
predicted to change their time again

696
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
this is like happening within an

697
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
instance of the agent

698
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
we've also seen you which is how actions

699
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,280
how policy maps on to the way that

700
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,400
states change

701
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,760
remember that policy enters the b matrix

702
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
so states are being inferred and then

703
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,919
we're inferring the b matrix which is

704
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
basically how our policies

705
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,320
affect how states influence uh how

706
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
states change through time

707
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
another notable feature here and

708
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
slightly outside of the blue box but in

709
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
the gray box is this gamma

710
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
or a precision parameter so as we do

711
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,320
this roll out

712
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
at a given instant and think ahead

713
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
through time how things are going to be

714
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,400
we're not just estimating the state

715
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
rollout through time

716
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
we're also estimating our actions

717
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
through time and how that influences

718
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
states and how they change

719
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
and a layer above that is this gamma

720
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
which is how sure am i about that

721
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,080
that's this layer of precision in the

722
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
estimate and that's coming through this

723
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,400
g

724
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
which is um related to the estimated

725
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,679
free energy

726
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
so again for each moment of the rollout

727
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
the agent is estimating a bunch of

728
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:33,919
things

729
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,200
inside this model and then stephen i'll

730
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
get to you after i finish this last

731
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
little bit

732
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
and then in the moment in the actual

733
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
timeline of the agent

734
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
it is having affect and so these

735
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
are the ways that these two models are

736
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
combined and we can look at some more

737
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,640
um unpackings in other slides but i just

738
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
want to start with the actual figure

739
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
used in the paper itself before going to

740
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,279
another citation

741
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,960
and the sophisticated inference is

742
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
capturing this deep roll out at an

743
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,520
instant

744
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
with a precision estimator and the

745
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
affective inference

746
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,279
is capturing this affective state that

747
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
carries forward in time

748
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
and so combining affective and

749
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,159
sophisticated inference

750
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
is quite literally structurally

751
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,279
combining

752
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
the patterns of affective inference from

753
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
this hesp at all citation

754
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,919
with the topological model structures of

755
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,360
sophisticated inference

756
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
we'll stay on here and continue thinking

757
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
about it stephen

758
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,480
so would i be right in saying that the

759
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,440
the

760
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,200
effective inference over time

761
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,080
is is kind of looking at the shape of

762
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
how

763
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,039
actions look like they're going to turn

764
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,720
out over time and

765
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,000
and sort of putting a feeling to that

766
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
in a simplistic term it's like there's

767
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,039
it's not

768
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,919
so you've got all these fairly discreet

769
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,520
moments being

770
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,559
looked at or assessed over time and the

771
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,760
sort of the shape

772
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,039
of that is what the feeling

773
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
is about that makes sense it's like is

774
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
it going is

775
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,600
is it like am i predicting this to be a

776
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,279
roller coaster ride

777
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,919
of uncertainty over the next few minutes

778
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,880
or am i

779
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
expecting it to be smooth you know

780
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
because that would be the kind of

781
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,720
the shape of the observations and the

782
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
expectations

783
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,799
as i stretch it out over time and that

784
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,400
itself becomes

785
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,039
something which is obs you know has a

786
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
generative model

787
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,840
um tracking it would that be a one way

788
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,720
of saying it

789
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,200
great and thanks for phrasing it in the

790
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,320
wording like as

791
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,480
it appears to you so let's start with

792
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,440
that shape

793
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,480
of the prediction that shape is actually

794
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,279
the shape of a probability distribution

795
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,880
it's the shape of the probability

796
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,679
distribution that is a generative model

797
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,760
and the shape of that it's kind of like

798
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
a cloud of points

799
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,039
or the bubble that encloses the cloud of

800
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
points it's a shape

801
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,559
that is existing let's just think

802
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,720
initially in two dimensions so like a

803
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,840
piece of paper

804
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
and on the y-axis is going to be how

805
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,360
rewarding is it

806
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
lots of reward or negative reward and

807
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,919
then the x-axis is precision

808
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,720
from low precision to high precision and

809
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,200
so

810
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
you could imagine that the shape could

811
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
be all the way clustered up on the top

812
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,080
right corner

813
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,399
so that would be high expected reward

814
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,200
but high precision that's the best state

815
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
the lowest state would be like the

816
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
bottom left where it's like low expected

817
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,760
reward

818
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,120
and low precision so again the reward

819
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,080
prioritizing mindset says the agent's

820
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,000
state should correspond to their state

821
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
estimate

822
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
the active inference perspective says no

823
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,039
no the agent's affect

824
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,159
is going to be related to their

825
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,799
uncertainty estimate more so

826
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
because if you have a small positive

827
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,000
state estimate

828
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
but you're very precise i'm gonna give

829
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,320
you five dollars plus or minus one cent

830
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
you say great and if you say i'm going

831
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,159
to give you five dollars plus or minus

832
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,120
25

833
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
you say wait a minute you're gonna maybe

834
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,320
take twenty dollars for me

835
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,799
even if it's a very small chance that

836
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,320
isn't as good as getting five

837
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,279
plus or minus one and so this is where

838
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,559
the state estimate

839
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,240
and the precision estimator are

840
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,279
orthogonal and so that's what delineates

841
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,840
the shape of the distribution that is

842
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
the generative model of the future

843
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,840
now in a traditional computational

844
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
psychology model

845
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,240
again agent affect would be tracked by

846
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,720
the

847
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
state estimate if it's above zero

848
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,080
expected then you're good

849
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
if it's below zero it's bad whereas in

850
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
the active inference framework

851
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
good affect is going to be associated

852
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
with precise estimates

853
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
and anxiety negative affect is going to

854
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,399
be associated with

855
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,080
high uncertainty and so as this agent

856
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
runs simulations going forward and

857
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,919
rolling them out we can look at what

858
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,440
that looks like

859
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,559
even if the expected reward is positive

860
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,120
if the ambiguity is high the uncertainty

861
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
is high it can

862
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
be anxiety producing so that is what

863
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,000
we're really

864
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,840
tracking is there's the structure of

865
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,399
this model which is like the topology or

866
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,840
the connectedness of how different

867
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,559
variables

868
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
influence each other in the model but

869
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,000
then the outcome of

870
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
all of this is the shape of the

871
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
distribution

872
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
of the prediction of the agent and

873
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
that's respectively just like all

874
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,080
predictions are

875
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,039
about state as well as uncertainty so

876
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,559
estimate about the world states the

877
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,760
hidden states in the world

878
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,919
and then a metacognitive estimate of our

879
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,960
precision

880
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,200
and so it's like this is one click

881
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
through time and then

882
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,960
the agent acts but it's simulating its

883
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,039
future actions at this moment

884
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,000
and then the actual model clicks over

885
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,919
and then it's in the next time step

886
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,159
for the agent and it starts simulating

887
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,120
from that moment

888
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
going forward and so that's one of the

889
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,320
features

890
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,559
that is uh something that's a hallmark

891
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,760
of this model

892
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
is it's like the game that's being

893
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,279
played has a net

894
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,320
positive return and let's just assume

895
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
that we had a degree of agency

896
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,200
we could probably choose small winning

897
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,720
outcomes within this game that we're

898
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,840
about to show

899
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,039
however by spiraling and by ruminating

900
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,320
deep through time

901
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
the agent starts thinking about

902
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,000
potential roads that are highly

903
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
uh rewarding as well as a small fraction

904
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,039
of paths that are very negative

905
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,120
and then the uncertainty in that

906
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,240
distribution

907
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,039
the spread on the x-axis or the higher

908
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,039
uncertainty on the x-axis

909
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,520
is actually leading to it being anxiety

910
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
producing even if the state estimate is

911
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,679
positive stephen

912
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,600
yeah i think this is this supports some

913
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
of the challenges we also

914
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
find with you know if you you see this

915
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,520
the numbers for the stock market you can

916
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,279
get this sense of full sense of

917
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
certainty that we all know what's going

918
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,279
on and it gives us

919
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,520
for some people that can make them quite

920
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,320
relaxed

921
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,760
and confident and here i go you know um

922
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
bullish as we might say and this this

923
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,159
would sort of support that sense of like

924
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,880
um if you're given this high level of

925
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
supposedly precision

926
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,399
and supposed um accuracy and

927
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,480
reliability you could get a full sense

928
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,919
of of that

929
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,799
and and that could be where you know at

930
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,320
the same time people challenge that and

931
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,240
look at like we need to blow that apart

932
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
because

933
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
you know if you if the confidence in

934
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
that suddenly disappears

935
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,039
and you see it as not being as precise

936
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,080
as you thought

937
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,200
the anxiety rises greatly and

938
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
you know other ways of thinking might

939
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,840
need to be thought you know come into

940
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
play cool

941
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,559
good connection there with decision

942
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,919
making in markets

943
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,000
which are very related to not just

944
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,919
estimates of value but estimates of

945
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,279
volatility

946
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
and uncertainty estimates about value

947
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,519
and about volatility

948
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,080
and so then you have people trading vix

949
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,399
you know trading the volatility index

950
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,120
or leveraging that and so these are like

951
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,399
higher level

952
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,519
ambiguity about ambiguity or risk about

953
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,399
risk

954
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,559
and then all of that is associated with

955
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,640
valence is it a good trade or a bad

956
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,279
trade

957
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,640
and so that's like coming back to

958
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
sasha's question about valence and

959
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
affect it's sort of like well there's so

960
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,159
many layers and ways that you could

961
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:10,640
leverage

962
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
trading but then in the end it's like

963
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
right but am i going to do

964
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,720
action a or not is it going to be a or b

965
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,679
is it a good trade

966
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
or not and that implicitly entails

967
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
preferences like i want to see my number

968
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,399
of bitcoin go up

969
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
not down but if you didn't have that

970
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,760
preference which is part of the c

971
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,279
matrix which is not shown here it's part

972
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,840
of the g if you didn't have a preference

973
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,679
then you wouldn't know which policy to

974
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,039
partake in like if you don't know where

975
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,679
you're going

976
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
every step is a losing step but then

977
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,480
with a preference vector c

978
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
you can actually ask is this trade a

979
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
good one or a bad one

980
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,799
and that is not just is the expected

981
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,320
value above zero

982
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,880
again that's reward landia that's reward

983
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
first uncertainty as a satellite

984
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
we're taking uncertainty first and we

985
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
still want to partake

986
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
in preferences in preference guided

987
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,840
policy selection

988
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
so instead of doing preferences to

989
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,360
reward maximization and then we'll deal

990
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,799
with the uncertainty later

991
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
it's like let's go from preference to

992
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
policy selection

993
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,880
with ambiguity as the heart of what

994
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,159
we're doing

995
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,519
and reward will fall out as a function

996
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,679
of reducing uncertainty about optimal

997
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
action in the world

998
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
given our preferences and affordances so

999
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,600
this is sort of the simple

1000
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,240
uh rearranging of ideas and

1001
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
reconfiguring that leads to some of

1002
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,840
these innovative insights in active

1003
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,799
inference

1004
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,559
steven just adding something

1005
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,360
into that is it also shows it can work

1006
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,080
the other way

1007
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,159
i know someone who does trading and he

1008
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,120
has to sort of

1009
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,720
monitor his heart rate they do a whole

1010
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,399
thing where he does like some relaxing

1011
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
and measures the heart rate and that

1012
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,000
before doing the work

1013
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,799
so that the state of the body doesn't

1014
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,760
mask what's actually going on you know

1015
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,399
so

1016
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,960
this also shows that you know if your

1017
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,000
physical state

1018
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,559
and your you know emotional state is is

1019
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,000
is out of whack in any

1020
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,918
way your your ability to to do this deep

1021
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:10,960
inference might be

1022
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,960
skewed or even you know uh

1023
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,918
lost because the the top level in the

1024
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,560
diagram

1025
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,879
is not necessarily tapping into the real

1026
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,679
data

1027
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,280
it's just tapping into the the the

1028
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,079
values

1029
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
about context arousal valence etc that

1030
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,520
is just in the whole system for the

1031
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
person correct and there's a lot of

1032
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,399
behavioral

1033
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
research not done in the active

1034
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,159
inference framework that shows like when

1035
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
people are in a pessimistic framework

1036
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
they might be more willing to satisfy

1037
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
with like a smaller

1038
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,918
gain in the short term whereas when

1039
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,960
somebody's feeling like

1040
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
abundant or optimistic or confident

1041
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,719
about their success

1042
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
they might be able to delay

1043
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,760
gratification and

1044
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,320
partake in larger gains in the future

1045
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,520
and so if you have somebody who's

1046
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
carrying over

1047
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,040
from the other tab quite literally

1048
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,320
negative affect

1049
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,520
or adversarial affect about the world

1050
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,440
and they flip over their trading account

1051
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,560
they're going to be making different

1052
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
kinds of decisions based upon their

1053
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,359
affective state

1054
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,520
that's going to carry into their

1055
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,040
estimates of precision

1056
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
which is related to anxiety higher

1057
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,160
precision

1058
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,079
lower anxiety those two are negatively

1059
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,200
correlated

1060
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,720
and then again in this caption the um

1061
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,599
imagined action model precision actions

1062
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,640
and states and outcomes

1063
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
everything inside of the gray and the

1064
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
blue box is

1065
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
inside the mind of an agent at a moment

1066
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
and so this is the rollout inside of the

1067
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,079
mind of an agent

1068
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,640
at a moment let's look at figure 2 and

1069
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,079
talk about this game

1070
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,119
that they actually simulate out so this

1071
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,560
is four state game um it's uh

1072
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
there's a lot of games that you could

1073
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,400
simulate but this is just one game

1074
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
and each of the edges reflect

1075
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
transitions that are possible

1076
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
so you start on like square one and then

1077
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,240
you can either move to square two or

1078
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,720
square three with some probability

1079
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
and you start out with a gain of zero

1080
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,079
it's a neutral state you can go to a

1081
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,440
safe small game

1082
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,880
so if you're just wanting to play it

1083
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,400
safe you could hang out and go between

1084
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,760
one and two

1085
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,320
however also you can go to this high

1086
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,960
gain

1087
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,320
three now three you're getting twice as

1088
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,720
much

1089
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
money however there's a one in three

1090
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,920
chance

1091
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,520
that you're going to or depending on how

1092
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,119
these edges are parameterized i should

1093
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,119
say there's a chance that you can move

1094
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,760
into this

1095
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,320
absorbing state that's painful and so

1096
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
the two adjectives there are painful

1097
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,040
so it has a negative reward of negative

1098
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,000
two

1099
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,560
and it's absorbing because you see that

1100
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,240
it can also uh

1101
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,720
swallow your trajectory like once you

1102
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,520
end up in four

1103
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
it's sort of like a negative state and

1104
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
so there are absorbing states in the

1105
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,720
world

1106
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,160
like death let's say once you hit

1107
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
this state you're staying in that state

1108
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,119
and so the agent is starting here

1109
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,040
and so it's like which square should i

1110
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
walk on to get um

1111
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,240
you know the most money or something

1112
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
like that and so if it just walks around

1113
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,839
it's going to end up here really quickly

1114
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,119
and get into this painful absorbing

1115
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,200
state and so it's thinking okay there's

1116
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,119
some paths i can imagine

1117
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
where i just walk back and forth between

1118
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,800
one and two there's some other paths

1119
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
where i walk around

1120
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,760
on one two three i'm just getting money

1121
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
or neutral every step

1122
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
and so what it's doing here is time one

1123
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,440
it's saying well on my next move i could

1124
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,880
go to one two or three

1125
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
and i could go to four but actually this

1126
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
edge isn't there so it's like not likely

1127
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,880
so

1128
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
the first step it's like it's literally

1129
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
all good your expectation is

1130
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,960
either one or two so your kind of

1131
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,000
estimate is a mean

1132
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,040
of one and a half with a small variance

1133
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
okay but now here if you stay on one and

1134
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
then continue on one now you're getting

1135
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,119
this

1136
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
path at time point three would give you

1137
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,119
zero here you'd have one dollar total

1138
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,880
zero zero one here you'd have three

1139
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,040
dollars total here you'd have

1140
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
plus one zero so one two four

1141
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,079
here you'd have two plus two is four so

1142
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
you're getting all these estimates now

1143
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,560
you have some fours

1144
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
but you also have some two negative twos

1145
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
and some uh

1146
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,880
negative fours so as you're rolling out

1147
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
this simulation

1148
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
at each time point actually the

1149
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
expectation is getting higher

1150
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
because if you think about it you can

1151
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,640
get negative two or plus two that

1152
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
cancels out and then plus one

1153
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,359
so each game you play each step the

1154
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,240
expectation is going to strictly grow

1155
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,040
however the variance is also going to

1156
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,560
strictly grow

1157
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,480
and so this is related to a few other

1158
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,760
probability games

1159
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,920
where it's like will you play this game

1160
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,960
where we gamble

1161
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,119
and then it's like double or nothing uh

1162
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,400
following double or nothing it's like

1163
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,280
the saint peter's

1164
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
st petersburg uh gamble it has another

1165
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,440
name as well

1166
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,680
and the reason why people don't pay

1167
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,640
infinite money

1168
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,800
to pay these uh to play these games with

1169
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
an infinite expected value

1170
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,680
is because the variance is so high and

1171
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,599
so what's happening is as the agent is

1172
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,680
rolling out in its minds

1173
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
these possible trajectories and this

1174
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,920
could be like chess trajectories or it

1175
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
could be like action selection policies

1176
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,960
or trades

1177
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,200
as it's rolling these out the variance

1178
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,320
is increasing

1179
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
and so that's making it anxious um

1180
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
that's sort of the heart of what's

1181
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,520
happening

1182
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,640
and then as we trace out the time steps

1183
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,760
of the model

1184
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
this is again just one trace of the

1185
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
simulation they're not exploring every

1186
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
parameter but this is very illustrative

1187
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,640
what happens is that in the first couple

1188
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
of hundred

1189
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,280
time points of the model the valence

1190
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,240
is good the agent is feeling good it's

1191
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,599
feeling good about ending up

1192
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,320
in large reward states and it has a

1193
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,359
fairly precise

1194
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,640
model on action and a small fraction of

1195
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,119
an

1196
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,160
of the imagined events are negative 0.04

1197
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,920
but then what starts happening is

1198
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
because that negative state is absorbing

1199
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
you get more and more trajectories

1200
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,119
lining up on this right side

1201
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,920
where it's like 4 as an absorbing state

1202
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
and so

1203
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,400
that is making that uh making the

1204
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,839
uncertainty strictly rise so around 500

1205
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,359
we have this phase transition

1206
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,760
where the precision on the agent's

1207
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,400
estimate

1208
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
drops rapidly it's like yeah i'm not

1209
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
sure what's going to happen after 500

1210
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,839
time points because there's some paths

1211
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,119
that are just super bad and there's some

1212
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,160
that are super good

1213
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,079
so when it was one time point i was like

1214
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,680
pretty sure i was gonna get one dollar

1215
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
or two dollars and i felt great

1216
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
but now that you're asking me to predict

1217
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
500 time points out

1218
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,800
i don't know if i'm gonna have a hundred

1219
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,160
thousand dollars or be a hundred

1220
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,880
thousand dollars

1221
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
in debt and that's actually getting me

1222
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
anxious that i don't know

1223
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,319
the precision and so again if someone

1224
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,839
said hey don't worry about the future

1225
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,359
because the expected value is gonna be

1226
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
positive a thousand dollars

1227
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
that's not a thousand dollars in my

1228
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,640
pocket that's a precise thousand dollars

1229
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,560
if somebody says the expected value is a

1230
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,480
thousand dollars but it has a huge

1231
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,640
variance it's going to be anxiety

1232
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,599
producing

1233
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,079
and so even though the threat perception

1234
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,119
is inching up

1235
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,640
from 0.04 to 0.1 so it still is not more

1236
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,599
than a 10 percent

1237
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,079
uh barely chance of these highly

1238
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,920
threatening events happening

1239
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,960
it turns out that um the

1240
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
uncertainty is what drives the valence

1241
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,520
not the percentage of negative events

1242
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,920
and then also interestingly and this can

1243
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,359
be overreading into one trace of the

1244
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:15,920
model

1245
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,160
but the phase transition the precision

1246
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,319
and uh valence happen at exactly the

1247
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,119
same time

1248
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,079
around 500 right before 500.

1249
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,880
interestingly

1250
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
the threat perception is going down

1251
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,480
overall

1252
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,280
leading up to 500 and then it starts

1253
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,640
kicking up again

1254
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,240
that's sort of like okay i drank all the

1255
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
coffee i'm feeling great it's like

1256
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
oh no i'm starting to get a little tired

1257
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,359
that coffee is not going to work that

1258
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,359
quantitative easing is not going to work

1259
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,119
and so even though the threat perception

1260
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,839
actually isn't as high as it has been

1261
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,720
the precision being so low leads to the

1262
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,240
valence being negative

1263
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,920
because the valence is being derived

1264
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
again from the anxiety from the

1265
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,720
uncertainty

1266
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,119
not from the expected value this is like

1267
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,040
a point we can always return to

1268
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,480
because it's a great example of the

1269
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,920
complementarity of traditional

1270
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,839
reward-centric understandings of reward

1271
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,119
learning and this more precision guided

1272
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,040
understanding of action selection in the

1273
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,240
niche

1274
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,280
okay any thoughts on those figures

1275
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,440
that's sort of the contribution of the

1276
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,319
paper in

1277
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,160
many ways is just to make this

1278
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,680
combination model

1279
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,680
that features the affective inference of

1280
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,480
the agent

1281
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
in their timeline and then at each

1282
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,760
moment this

1283
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,040
imagined rollout and um yeah

1284
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,400
it's a discrete time model

1285
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,800
and uh yeah any thoughts or questions or

1286
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,079
there's more stuff we can continue to

1287
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,839
look

1288
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
through

1289
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,800
cool so just to put it up there and

1290
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
anyone can raise their hand

1291
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,119
table one has some of the mathematical

1292
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:53,760
details

1293
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,079
so hopefully with ryan and any other

1294
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,000
authors next week we'll be able to talk

1295
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,040
about these details and uh

1296
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,240
here is that that gamma which is

1297
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,480
one over the precision so sometimes

1298
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,920
you'll hear about it as

1299
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,640
precision maximizing other times you'll

1300
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,520
hear about it as uncertainty

1301
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,240
minimizing and those two the min and the

1302
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,960
max

1303
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,520
are related by this one over feature

1304
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,079
just

1305
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,800
one point so it's kind of like um on

1306
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
network

1307
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
networks there's one type of problem

1308
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,200
called

1309
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,400
the max flow like you want to have flow

1310
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,200
through network

1311
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,079
internet or water or resources and so

1312
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,440
you might want to know

1313
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,640
what the cut is that's going to be most

1314
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,319
damaging or the least damaging to the

1315
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,040
network

1316
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,640
and so sometimes the most and the least

1317
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,400
are related by this one over

1318
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,000
feature um okay any thoughts because

1319
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
there's a lot of formalisms we can

1320
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,160
continue to

1321
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,839
walk through and we have a good amount

1322
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,359
of time but like

1323
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,920
maybe just pausing here what would be

1324
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,640
something

1325
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
you would say to somebody who had never

1326
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,720
heard of active inference

1327
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,800
and just what is something that it

1328
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,079
captures that other

1329
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,760
models haven't captured or something

1330
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,359
that you'd be excited to see it head in

1331
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,760
the direction towards stephen thanks

1332
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,119
well i think the counterintuitive nature

1333
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,480
and the ability for things

1334
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,640
to be unexpectedly stable and

1335
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,680
unexpectedly

1336
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,000
transitioned is something that

1337
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,520
i don't know of in a way that

1338
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
traditional models of the world

1339
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,280
would show you you know because you know

1340
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,560
you could be like oh

1341
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
people would normally either just take

1342
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,920
one of those moments and then that gets

1343
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,760
extrapolated for everything but actually

1344
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
you need to follow it over time

1345
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,000
because it matters a lot

1346
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,119
it does and it needs to be um kind of

1347
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,680
through time in two ways the actual

1348
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,160
agent

1349
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,480
needs to be progressing through time but

1350
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,400
at each time point the agent needs to be

1351
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
simulating

1352
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,800
time points of the past present and

1353
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,599
future and so that's this like double

1354
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,599
timeline that's happening with the

1355
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,680
model's topology here

1356
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,240
is you could have another pink box right

1357
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,359
next to this one

1358
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,640
and that would be like the next time

1359
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,880
point of the agent but it's like right

1360
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,800
now it's 10 a.m and i'm looking ahead to

1361
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
10 11 12 and then it's 11 and then i'm

1362
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,000
thinking ahead again but i'm also

1363
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,040
looking back

1364
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
and all of that is being spun out of the

1365
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,640
generative model

1366
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,640
of the trajectory stephen yeah that's

1367
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,760
and i thought it was interesting i

1368
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,240
haven't seen a positive

1369
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,839
valence and a negative value i haven't

1370
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,720
seen sort of two dynamics

1371
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,160
mapped alongside each other

1372
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
simultaneously normally there's just the

1373
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,079
one so i thought that's something

1374
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,119
that's kind of uh the good and bad as

1375
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,640
to you know it's not just about good

1376
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,880
it's about the blending of good and bad

1377
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,680
i thought that's good so

1378
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,960
i mean theoretically you could have

1379
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,880
loads of variants of that

1380
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,640
you know you could have good the bad the

1381
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
ugly

1382
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,560
yep yep valence just like uh an electron

1383
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,000
or a proton you know valence

1384
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
of plus or minus that's plus to minus

1385
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,640
positive and negative valence

1386
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
but affect is a multi-dimensional

1387
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,000
landscape

1388
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,680
and so that is something that could be

1389
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,160
explored in a higher dimensional way

1390
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,319
but again let's think about that trading

1391
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,280
example

1392
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
there's so many ways oh it's an elegant

1393
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
trade it's an ugly trade it was a clumsy

1394
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,000
one

1395
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,040
it was a uh one with very much foresight

1396
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,880
or it was a retributive trade all these

1397
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,520
adjectives

1398
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,160
but then what does it boil down to given

1399
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
my preferences and my affordances was it

1400
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,599
a good trade

1401
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,760
and that if your preferences are hey i

1402
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,800
have too much money

1403
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,480
i'm trying to sponsor a couple people

1404
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,079
who have less crypto than me

1405
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,200
than a quote good trade given that

1406
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,400
preference

1407
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,280
vector might not look like a preference

1408
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,599
uh

1409
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,359
or a policy selected by somebody with a

1410
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,640
different preference

1411
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,800
so that is where agent-specific

1412
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
preferences come into play

1413
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
is you're never going to get away from

1414
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
that the agent is not doing this neutral

1415
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,839
calculation

1416
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,560
followed by a secondary step of policy

1417
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,440
selection

1418
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,520
the preferences for policy and for

1419
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,359
outcomes are entrenched

1420
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,280
within the kernel of this model at every

1421
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,000
single time step stephen

1422
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,400
and and that gives a plausible bayesian

1423
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
route to your gut feeling

1424
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,560
i mean some of those emotions like

1425
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,280
you're saying

1426
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,760
the an elegant trade might be kind of a

1427
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,720
cognitive process and

1428
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,440
some other type of part of it might be

1429
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,040
kicking your deep

1430
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,240
you know there's certain times when

1431
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,440
you're thinking about stuff and then

1432
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,040
suddenly you get a sinking feeling in

1433
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,000
your stomach

1434
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,119
you know and it's like well that that um

1435
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,480
who knows where that's coming from but

1436
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,319
this gives a

1437
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,359
you only get one overall

1438
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,440
sort of gut feeling you only get one

1439
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,880
overall sort of

1440
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,079
um move to actively infer

1441
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,880
how to take action in the world and all

1442
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,359
these

1443
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,079
different things they only become

1444
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,839
available to you when you maybe reflect

1445
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,680
on it later and you have to describe

1446
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,599
why you had that gut feeling like you

1447
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,720
just mentioned

1448
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,839
there could be hundreds of different

1449
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,319
things all being basically

1450
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,920
integrated exactly and that's this go

1451
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,240
no go hey i'm just not feeling good

1452
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,079
about this this whole vacation

1453
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,599
or i'm just feeling really great i don't

1454
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,119
know what's behind the door number four

1455
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,640
but i'm feeling great about it

1456
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,200
that valence aspect of prediction for

1457
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,240
the future

1458
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,119
is like the highest level control

1459
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,480
summary statistic

1460
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
it's like are we going to accept this

1461
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,760
person into the college

1462
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,480
or not there's so many other dimensions

1463
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,839
but it gets distilled

1464
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,760
into the choke point through the mark

1465
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,280
called blanket of action

1466
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,319
it gets distilled into go or no go

1467
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,640
on that specific person or that specific

1468
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,040
policy or that specific outcome

1469
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,119
and so that's actually the justification

1470
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,800
for the use of valence

1471
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,440
as a simple positive to negative even

1472
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,040
though there's so many other dimensions

1473
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,839
to affect

1474
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,720
overall it does get distilled into this

1475
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,760
gut feeling

1476
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,800
which you can go into and and uh you can

1477
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,240
cognize you can add

1478
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,400
adjectives on top but it's sort of

1479
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,280
interesting it's like

1480
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,760
is the gut feeling just positive versus

1481
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,640
negative

1482
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,200
and when you introspect do you get

1483
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,760
higher and higher levels of abstracted

1484
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,800
polysyllabic emotions or do you get

1485
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,440
deeper and deeper into your body and

1486
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,960
into increasingly

1487
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,559
summary statistics like go no go um

1488
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,200
freeze fight these are things like go

1489
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,400
and no go

1490
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
let's look through a couple oh sasha go

1491
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,640
ahead

1492
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,520
that's kind of what i was thinking is

1493
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,640
with this model

1494
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,000
of valence would uh

1495
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,200
a human participant let's say um be able

1496
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,599
to

1497
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,920
self-report in this similar way about

1498
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
their valence during an experience or is

1499
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,640
this kind of like the

1500
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,640
you know hidden by the markov blanket

1501
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,000
and um

1502
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,040
we can have these models to help explain

1503
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,720
what was happening at the time but

1504
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,520
those states might be unaccessible to uh

1505
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,280
people actually experiencing

1506
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,480
this you know decision making process

1507
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,520
and um yeah it just reminds me of

1508
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,480
i guess how people spend money and

1509
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,200
thinking about

1510
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,559
economic um economic decisions that

1511
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,960
people make that are you know either

1512
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,720
logical or not logical

1513
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,760
and that it really um has little to do

1514
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,640
with

1515
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,680
the money that we have

1516
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,599
and then the mindset that we have about

1517
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,760
the money and like how we ought to be

1518
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,480
spending it

1519
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,880
and um you know who we want to be

1520
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
supporting or not with our

1521
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,640
uh investment decision and

1522
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,760
yeah it's just really uh i don't know

1523
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,599
it's at such a higher level

1524
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,160
than just thinking about someone's

1525
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,960
salary

1526
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,760
it's how they interact with the economic

1527
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,400
system

1528
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,160
and um what role they might play in it

1529
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,480
and just especially in the holidays like

1530
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,680
all i can think is we're

1531
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,000
so deeply influenced by um

1532
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
times and like season and tradition

1533
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,319
with how we choose to uh how and where

1534
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,319
we choose to spend money

1535
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,920
right you send money you literally give

1536
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,960
money away to people on their birthday

1537
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,040
on their biorhythm or you know in the

1538
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,319
holiday season

1539
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,079
and then also what you just said sasha

1540
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,839
reminded me of like coarse graining

1541
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,480
estimates

1542
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,559
and why it's so important if your

1543
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,559
economic estimate that you're making is

1544
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,359
will we have enough or not you might be

1545
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,119
very confident that you'll have enough

1546
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,880
say i don't know the details but

1547
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,200
i'm confident that we'll have enough or

1548
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,079
even

1549
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,680
i'm confident we're not going to have

1550
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,599
enough and we're going to have to do xyz

1551
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,240
policy

1552
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
okay we can work with that but if you're

1553
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,200
trying to do a estimate down to the cent

1554
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,599
you might have a very noisy estimate and

1555
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,960
then

1556
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,440
apparently people can get quite anxious

1557
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,000
about

1558
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
relatively small amounts of money that

1559
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,680
are way up there

1560
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,920
in the big salary range is it going to

1561
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,119
be this number

1562
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,440
or a slightly higher or slightly smaller

1563
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,160
number

1564
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,680
so there's this jockeying and

1565
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,319
uncertainty up there at the high level

1566
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,240
because they're doing a nine figure

1567
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,559
precision estimate with a large variance

1568
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,000
whereas there's something to be said for

1569
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
coarse graining and simplifying

1570
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
and functionalizing it and actually not

1571
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,319
just reducing the cognitive load

1572
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,000
but increasing the precision of our

1573
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,400
estimate even if the state estimate

1574
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,520
is inferior so there's so much there to

1575
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,079
continue

1576
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,760
exploring let's just walk through some

1577
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,920
more of these formalisms because

1578
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
most of this paper um we can just scroll

1579
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,960
through it just to

1580
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,520
you know show you but it's 10 pages long

1581
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,880
including references

1582
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,000
and basically they introduce

1583
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,520
give that figure one that we just looked

1584
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,359
at give figure two that we just looked

1585
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:51,839
at

1586
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,040
give the table we looked at show the

1587
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,920
results

1588
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,680
for figure three and there's the whole

1589
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,520
paper so short

1590
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,760
very very short so let's go into these

1591
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,880
two citations

1592
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,440
underlying the paper centrally and then

1593
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,480
just find out what they

1594
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,200
might show us and we're going to be

1595
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,480
talking about

1596
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,119
deeply felt affect in april i believe so

1597
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,480
again sophisticated

1598
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,559
affective inference is drawing the

1599
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,400
affect from this left side and the

1600
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
temporal depth from the right side

1601
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,720
three areas we could imagine this area

1602
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,559
of research heading towards would be

1603
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,480
more advanced simulations

1604
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,400
so agents that are simulating in

1605
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,520
continuous time

1606
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,040
or with higher dimensional action

1607
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,720
policies just like we've seen from

1608
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,839
active 8

1609
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,000
with scaling active inference or towards

1610
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,839
the computational psychiatry angle

1611
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,680
something that ryan smith and others

1612
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,280
have written review papers

1613
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,200
about and a lot of empirical work as

1614
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
well so we'll hear more about that next

1615
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:47,839
time

1616
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,200
and then there's this angle of the

1617
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,599
models for robotics which is like

1618
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,319
what if the drone had a top level

1619
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,599
summary statistic

1620
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,520
that's just like is this mission going

1621
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,880
well or not

1622
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,760
and if not then that might engage some

1623
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,400
um

1624
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,680
policies like head back home or pause or

1625
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,520
land or get to safety

1626
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,920
but that's a top level summary statistic

1627
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,280
that even robots might be able to

1628
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,720
utilize and i know that some people are

1629
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,119
doing that kind of stuff

1630
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,000
so in sophisticated inference and this

1631
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,960
is to bridge

1632
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,160
the gap between the formalisms and the

1633
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,960
actual sentences that are driving us

1634
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,200
we're gonna kind of write it in a little

1635
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,559
bit of a hybrid script

1636
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,040
like a rebus so the big question that

1637
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,720
agents are trying to answer

1638
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,119
in the world and in sophisticated

1639
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,000
inference is

1640
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,400
how can we have the best policy over a

1641
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,920
given time horizon

1642
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,799
so not what's the best chess move now

1643
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,240
it's what's the best chess move

1644
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,520
over the time horizon that i'm

1645
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,520
considering

1646
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,440
and tied up in that question about

1647
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
evaluating the best policy over a given

1648
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,559
time horizon

1649
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,920
is the question of what are the

1650
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
consequences of policies through time

1651
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
and how do we estimate that what is our

1652
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,359
estimate

1653
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,160
and what that is related to how we how

1654
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,119
we benchmark

1655
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,400
how we compare policies and their

1656
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,200
consequences is specifically related to

1657
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,839
how we understand observations being

1658
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,280
mapped to hidden states

1659
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,400
and our policy which is how our

1660
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,839
actions are influencing the way that

1661
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,200
hidden states change between each other

1662
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,000
that's that b

1663
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,599
matrix and the generalized free energy

1664
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,559
which is this par

1665
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,040
and fristen citation so another citation

1666
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,280
link away from the i wide paper

1667
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,960
is that the generalized free energy

1668
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,880
basically consists of one model

1669
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,000
that conditions on policies and then

1670
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,480
asks about how state transitions occur

1671
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,119
so

1672
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,359
conditioning on me exercising every day

1673
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,799
what kind of state transitions can i

1674
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,400
expect to see in the world

1675
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,559
and then the second part of the free

1676
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,359
energy is conditioning on states

1677
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,160
what policies should be selected so this

1678
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,760
is the two-stroke engine

1679
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,119
condition on what i know about the

1680
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,119
world's world states and causal model of

1681
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,880
the world generative model of the world

1682
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,559
what is my policy selection that's the

1683
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,319
control theory that's the cybernetic

1684
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,119
side

1685
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,559
that's the action side um action looking

1686
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,200
side and then this first part is again

1687
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,599
conditioning on my policies in the world

1688
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,119
what are the state transitions and how

1689
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,119
did those change and there's more nuance

1690
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,400
because of course we're just describing

1691
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
it in natural language but this is sort

1692
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,040
of the broad

1693
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,040
outline one half of free energy

1694
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,640
conditions on policy

1695
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,680
the other part um selects policy

1696
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,599
and basically vice versa with state

1697
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,599
transitions

1698
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,760
and so here's related to this q and p

1699
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,000
which we saw in tale of two densities

1700
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
we talked about it again in integrating

1701
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,760
internalism and externalism

1702
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,240
q conditions on policy that's a vertical

1703
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,839
line p

1704
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,319
you're estimating o and s through t

1705
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,440
through time

1706
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,480
as conditioned on p and then

1707
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,000
uh p is conditioned on states

1708
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,839
so again we're conditioning on two

1709
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,359
different parts

1710
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,720
and uh that's also uh how we end up

1711
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,400
using this two-stroke engine to do

1712
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,680
inference in complex settings

1713
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,680
we also talked about amortized inference

1714
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,440
but don't want to go into that

1715
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,400
here blue this is the slide that always

1716
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,200
makes me

1717
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,520
think about you with uh where's the

1718
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,960
information gain

1719
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,359
and could the pure information gaining

1720
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,000
agent

1721
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,400
get reward or does the pure reward

1722
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
seeker gain information

1723
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,440
and like where is this play interplay

1724
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,640
between the intrinsic values or the

1725
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,559
salience and then the intrinsic value in

1726
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:31,760
the novelty

1727
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
so the way that these two and all all

1728
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,799
these different features and the

1729
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,880
different representations i mean

1730
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,040
there's so much to say about and think

1731
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,640
here but stephen and then anyone else

1732
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,200
yeah could you just go back to that the

1733
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,880
one where you put those two terms

1734
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
between action the generative

1735
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,160
model and the that one yeah see

1736
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,319
that's kind of interesting that

1737
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,400
generative model says state transitions

1738
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,599
policies

1739
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,880
and policies final states so policies

1740
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
final states is probably a bit more

1741
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,079
action and like least

1742
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,400
energy route and the other one maybe is

1743
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,599
a bit more

1744
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,319
generative models a bit more processed

1745
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,599
and sensory

1746
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,240
data it's a bit more cognitive

1747
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,520
sort of feely cognition if that makes

1748
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,799
sense i'd like that

1749
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,680
that if that's correct but like is it

1750
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,200
like that you've got like a perception

1751
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,960
action part to those two in a way

1752
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,640
one's a bit more perception heavy ones a

1753
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,520
bit more action heavy or

1754
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,200
let's return to that in a second blue

1755
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,960
so i just wanted to comment while we're

1756
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,799
here about like what you had said

1757
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,400
in the um in the introduction video um

1758
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
related to like why are we always trying

1759
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,440
to you know

1760
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
estimate the states when really we

1761
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,880
should be trying to

1762
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,359
estimate the best policy right like

1763
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,480
that's what we should be

1764
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,240
predicting over not trying to predict

1765
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,680
the states like with this

1766
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,280
bring three jackets instead of one

1767
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,559
jacket and then you'll always be at the

1768
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,359
right temperature

1769
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,839
like if if we prepare versus trying to

1770
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:04,400
predict

1771
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,359
the the state of what's going to be i

1772
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,400
think that that's a

1773
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,160
just was a neat thought that occurred to

1774
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,680
me exactly

1775
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,319
um when there's too much emphasis on

1776
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:14,960
precise

1777
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,359
estimates of world states it's

1778
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,480
implicitly like

1779
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,240
we're focusing so much on precise

1780
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,680
estimates of world states

1781
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,680
that we'll just know what to do when we

1782
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,599
have that precise estimate it's like

1783
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,599
that's not true it turns out that maybe

1784
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,920
again a one digit of precision or even

1785
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,240
uh

1786
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,040
to the nearest 10 of the temperature

1787
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,599
from a policy perspective you'll be fine

1788
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,880
if it's um 20 celsius plus or minus 10

1789
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,440
you might be fine within a broad range

1790
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,119
of world state predictions

1791
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,839
from an action selection policy because

1792
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,119
your action selection could be

1793
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,040
cool i'll throw a jacket in my backpack

1794
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
and then i'll be fine whatever it is

1795
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,400
and so that is this um two-stroke engine

1796
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,079
this hand-off or handshake between

1797
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,319
co-estimating

1798
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,000
states and their transitions like

1799
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
weather in the world and the transitions

1800
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,440
between different weather states in the

1801
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:03,920
world

1802
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,200
given what you know about weather we're

1803
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,960
not on mars it's not going to do a you

1804
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,520
know acid rain storm at 400 degrees

1805
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,280
so it's like given what we know about

1806
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,040
the distributions of the niche

1807
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,799
the statistical regularities of the

1808
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,680
niche we want to be

1809
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,599
co-estimating states and

1810
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,799
our action action and perception

1811
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,720
and we want to be doing that in a way

1812
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,240
that suffices

1813
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,799
that's adequate to remain within our

1814
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,760
preferred

1815
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,920
areas our preferred strange attractors

1816
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,280
where we're able to

1817
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,480
basically have reduced uncertainty about

1818
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,680
the things that we care about the

1819
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,839
physiological variables that matter like

1820
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,119
our temperature

1821
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,480
and okay so it's it's is very

1822
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,720
cool and again just for those who

1823
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,240
haven't seen these kinds of equations

1824
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,119
that much

1825
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,559
the vertical line means conditions on

1826
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,480
and then whatever follows it you can

1827
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,079
think of is like fixed

1828
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,079
so it's like you have a spreadsheet and

1829
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,920
let's just say that the rows are

1830
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,720
policies

1831
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,240
and the columns are like state

1832
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,319
transitions and so when you

1833
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,359
fix on one it's like you pick out you

1834
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,319
fix a column

1835
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,520
and then you're asking about the

1836
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,760
distribution of that vector

1837
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,319
fixed on that column and similarly you

1838
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,040
could fix

1839
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,680
a row select one row condition on one

1840
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,400
row

1841
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,240
and then ask about the distribution in

1842
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,680
that line

1843
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,160
going across and so that's the full

1844
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,119
matrix

1845
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,799
and uh also that's related to what's

1846
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,160
called marginal

1847
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,559
likelihood in bayesian statistics the

1848
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,520
margin is

1849
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,839
literally the margin of the page when

1850
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,079
they used to do it with physical pages

1851
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,559
so it's like rows by columns and the

1852
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,079
marginal likelihood

1853
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,160
is related to the margin of the page

1854
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,359
which is just so fun

1855
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,200
it's kind of like a floppy disk icon but

1856
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,839
for statistics

1857
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,960
um here's another cool

1858
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,440
piece of the sophisticated inference

1859
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,400
paper

1860
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,480
and i think there's a lot i'd like to

1861
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,000
learn and ask here

1862
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,039
to casper and others

1863
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,640
but this formulation of

1864
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,119
policy p pi selection can people people

1865
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,799
can see my red thing right

1866
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:12,079
pi is related to the argument

1867
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,359
minimization

1868
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,160
of free energy of policy so this is

1869
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:16,559
saying

1870
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,119
the policy that gets selected pi is

1871
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,640
going to be like a free energy

1872
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,520
minimization

1873
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,520
of g as a function of all the policies

1874
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,000
that could be done so of my affordances

1875
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,880
we're going to do a free energy

1876
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,240
minimization and that's how i'm going to

1877
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,599
select my policy

1878
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,440
okay well what is g of pi g of pi

1879
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,559
is related to the expectation of

1880
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,760
what risk minus ambiguity

1881
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,960
so high risk is going to be a higher

1882
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,760
number

1883
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,240
and that's worse in this case we want

1884
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:46,960
it's like golf

1885
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,359
we want to minimize the free energy and

1886
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,319
so we're

1887
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,760
jointly trading off and there's some

1888
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,599
natural logs and some negative natural

1889
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,240
logs so

1890
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,920
it's sometimes a little bit hard to see

1891
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,680
if you're going like up or downhill

1892
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,359
which is why it's so important to have

1893
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,720
it phrased like this

1894
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,920
but basically risk is bad and ambiguity

1895
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,520
is bad but it turns out with the natural

1896
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,400
logs that

1897
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,920
you can just think of them as being

1898
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,160
combined so it's like

1899
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,000
if we seek to maximize um our precision

1900
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,799
minimize risk minimize ambiguity what

1901
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,240
we'll be doing

1902
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,760
is actually a strict bound on

1903
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,920
the intrinsic value and the extrinsic

1904
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,880
value

1905
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,000
so this formulation of search

1906
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
of information gain related to risk and

1907
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,200
ambiguity

1908
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,240
turns out to be strictly bounded by this

1909
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,280
value-driven process so

1910
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,599
worldview related to reward you see that

1911
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,440
agents are reward seekers

1912
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,520
and uncertainty is something they just

1913
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,440
simply deal with or they figure out or

1914
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:45,760
they

1915
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,079
thrive despite in the active inference

1916
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,119
perspective

1917
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,400
agents are uncertainty reducers who

1918
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,559
obtain rewards and if they don't they

1919
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,480
die that's evolution

1920
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,240
and so we're putting risk and

1921
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,680
uncertainty first

1922
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,680
and so instead of saying like well the

1923
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,720
agent predicts

1924
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,799
value and that ends up reducing its

1925
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,400
uncertainty about the world

1926
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,079
we're actually saying no it's a way more

1927
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,839
tractable calculation

1928
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,240
for the agent to be reducing its

1929
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,520
uncertainty about

1930
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,760
action again not just about states the

1931
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,200
world but the agent is reducing its

1932
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
uncertainty about action

1933
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,839
through action it's performing optimal

1934
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,160
foraging experimentation

1935
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,799
in order to reduce its uncertainty about

1936
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,319
best actions

1937
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,640
and it turns out that that is going to

1938
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,240
have a bound

1939
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,160
it's always going to be converging

1940
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,359
towards

1941
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,640
this perfect trade-off between intrinsic

1942
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,119
and extrinsic value

1943
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,400
and special cases fall out of this

1944
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,400
where certain variables are basically

1945
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,760
fixed to zero so if you have no

1946
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,960
prior at the beginning and you just

1947
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,160
let it start kind of draw from your

1948
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,760
first observations

1949
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,599
you take those and you use that as your

1950
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,440
first hyper prior that's like the

1951
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,720
parametric empirical base and

1952
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,520
in this case you end up recapitulating

1953
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,119
several things from bayesian statistics

1954
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,559
like optimal bayesian design

1955
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,839
or just surprise and then similarly

1956
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,960
if you set the ambiguity to zero so

1957
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,920
like the case in active inference eight

1958
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,640
where

1959
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,880
the states were perfectly observable

1960
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,119
like the pendulum and the mountain car

1961
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,880
it wasn't like it was getting a noisy

1962
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,799
estimate of where it was on the mountain

1963
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:31,280
it knew

1964
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
exactly where it was on the mountain and

1965
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,599
in the case of of no ambiguity

1966
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,720
about states again ambiguity is the the

1967
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,119
p

1968
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,039
distribution of observations given

1969
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,880
states so that's like

1970
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,799
given that it's daytime am i seeing

1971
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,359
photons so if you have no ambiguity

1972
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,200
about that then this term is zero

1973
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,400
right which makes risk minimization

1974
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,640
the imperative and that's why when you

1975
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,079
get no ambiguity

1976
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,480
you find that this whole framework

1977
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,839
collapses into

1978
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,880
risk control whereas if you had

1979
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,520
risk collapse to zero like it's a no

1980
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:07,920
risk

1981
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,640
situation the only imperative would be

1982
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,640
reduction of ambiguity

1983
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,640
so now let's think about that in reward

1984
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,680
land if you didn't have to seek value

1985
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,200
it could be purely novelty-based search

1986
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,359
whereas if the only imperative were to

1987
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,200
obtain short-term value

1988
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,280
you would not expect that kind of agent

1989
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,000
to be engaged in a creative search

1990
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,400
so it's sort of like each of these are

1991
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,079
um phrasings whether risk

1992
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,640
minus ambiguity or intrinsic minus

1993
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,319
extrinsic value

1994
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,319
you can see how either one of them could

1995
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,520
be like

1996
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
zeroed out and what that would do for

1997
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,799
the other side

1998
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,880
or you could imagine in realistic

1999
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,920
situations

2000
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,000
where they're sort of like tied up in a

2001
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,280
specific way

2002
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,119
so again you could imagine a no risk

2003
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,680
scenario a no ambiguity scenario

2004
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,760
no intrinsic or no extrinsic any of

2005
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,799
these combinations

2006
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,559
we'll do steven and then sasha

2007
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,480
yeah this is really good the way you're

2008
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,000
putting this together here

2009
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,119
and explaining it i think also this

2010
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,680
obviously these things sometimes they

2011
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,359
become really clear when it's an extreme

2012
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,200
case then you've got this blending

2013
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,079
that's going on um you know it's not

2014
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,839
fully any one of these

2015
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,200
but i i think that no ambiguity piece is

2016
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,920
is is a useful one to think about what

2017
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,039
happens sometimes when um

2018
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,240
well you could say i don't know if you'd

2019
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,880
say trump but when in the politics when

2020
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,680
something is

2021
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,799
if people say these people are bad and

2022
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,640
you know you often see that even at work

2023
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,160
and it's a no-brainer

2024
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,319
things are said to be a no-brainer then

2025
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:43,839
suddenly everyone

2026
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,240
the the the intrinsic value of trying to

2027
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,440
explore other options

2028
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,160
is can be collapsed in people and they

2029
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,880
just go

2030
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,480
with the extrinsic value of

2031
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,720
gain because there's no there's

2032
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,640
supposedly no ambiguity

2033
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,280
and i think that that could be

2034
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,640
interested in social

2035
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,599
yep situation yep like we know exactly

2036
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:06,400
how dangerous

2037
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,880
this virus is there's no discussion

2038
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,520
about what the risk minimizing policy is

2039
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,160
oh wait a minute is there sasha

2040
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,759
okay very leading questions um

2041
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,799
in hearing this description just

2042
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,839
really thinking about

2043
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,560
using this to define play and

2044
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,359
really seeing play as the combination of

2045
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,759
factors that has

2046
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,040
very low risk but

2047
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,040
like high uh value of exploration

2048
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,080
and so setting up things that

2049
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,439
have low risk but high opportunities for

2050
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,640
curiosity

2051
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,439
that would be i guess for me fit into

2052
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,279
the category of play

2053
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,479
so that's that's a good way to think

2054
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,719
about it and

2055
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,920
and another fun part there is like when

2056
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,960
value is the imperative it's difficult

2057
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,120
to be exploratory and creative it's like

2058
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,040
maslow's hierarchy of needs

2059
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,000
but then when there can be the space

2060
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,679
where you can actually engage in a

2061
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,319
novelty or a curiosity guided search

2062
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,080
kind of the prerequisite the enabling

2063
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,319
feature of that is sufficiency at a

2064
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,759
material level

2065
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,040
so that isn't simply related to reward

2066
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,120
we don't just give people reward kind of

2067
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,880
dial up their dopamine and then they'll

2068
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,319
be acting creatively

2069
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,399
it's actually like we need to scaffold

2070
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,719
the agent in the environment

2071
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,920
in a way where it can reduce its risk

2072
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,120
so that it can tolerate higher ambiguity

2073
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,158
or reduce ambiguity so that we can

2074
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:46,960
engage

2075
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,319
with higher risk scenarios so sometimes

2076
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:50,880
these

2077
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,560
combinations of features even though

2078
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,080
risk and ambiguity they're just english

2079
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,600
words so really it is about the

2080
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,560
formalism

2081
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,159
but it helps us reimagine and

2082
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,159
repartition and fluidly

2083
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,320
move across partitionings for how to

2084
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,920
think about these nuanced control

2085
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,400
problems

2086
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,760
sasha um

2087
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,159
also it makes me think about how this is

2088
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,760
commonly studied like in psychology

2089
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,199
lab spaces and

2090
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,080
yeah really thinking about like how

2091
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,159
using this framework to figure out

2092
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,199
what would make the participants what

2093
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,960
state that would put them in

2094
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,400
as well as how uh

2095
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,800
they feel about the risk and ambiguity

2096
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,159
of the situation that they're in

2097
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,239
because depending on how you feel about

2098
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,120
participating in research

2099
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,840
that would change what state of

2100
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,719
exploration

2101
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,159
or curiosity you might be in and that

2102
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,280
i don't know it just really makes me

2103
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,480
rethink a lot of um

2104
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,280
research in this field because it's

2105
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,159
ignoring

2106
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:57,040
or i guess excluding one of the key

2107
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,760
variables of this process

2108
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,159
yep and it makes me think about safe

2109
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,040
spaces

2110
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,600
but we could also say how risky is this

2111
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,199
space that's sort of related to safety

2112
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,560
those are like one over

2113
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,800
each other you know risk equals one over

2114
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,080
safety but also

2115
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,880
how ambiguous is this space we want this

2116
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,760
space to be

2117
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,480
safe so not risky but we also want this

2118
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,520
space to be

2119
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,679
not ambiguous we want to be clear and

2120
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,920
communicating about what this space is

2121
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,320
however we don't want to make it so

2122
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,560
unambiguous there's no room to play

2123
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,640
so we want to have the optimal level of

2124
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,560
ambiguity and risk that's controlled

2125
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,199
novelty

2126
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,760
that's pareto optimality that's free

2127
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,960
energy minimization

2128
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,280
that's living on the frontier between

2129
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,159
performance

2130
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,239
and innovation so that's where all these

2131
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,520
models can take us

2132
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,840
and that's why it reimagines the bottom

2133
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,199
up versus top down

2134
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,520
the explorer versus exploit the

2135
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,360
maximization in the long term versus the

2136
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,159
short term

2137
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,440
those are all coming from from the

2138
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,199
reward mentality

2139
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,640
and when we think about the situated

2140
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,239
agent reducing uncertainty

2141
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,719
about action through action we have a

2142
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,080
whole new set of ways to talk about

2143
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,880
these questions

2144
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,719
stephen you're then blue and

2145
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,640
bring it back as well with this paper

2146
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,920
and you know the way it talks about

2147
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,159
temple depth and and is it it can also

2148
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,679
combine with this giveaway to think

2149
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,760
about what they call stages of readiness

2150
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,640
because people sort of think oh you know

2151
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,239
that could read this and like okay we've

2152
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,239
made it safe i've said it safe i've told

2153
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,600
everyone it's safe

2154
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,760
well it might be you've told them it's

2155
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,840
safe and you've demonstrated it safe and

2156
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,440
the environment's been safe but it might

2157
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,440
be five minutes it might be

2158
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,239
three weeks of training before people

2159
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,080
start to

2160
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,520
bring that safety into the way that they

2161
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,280
balance these different parameters you

2162
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,239
know so

2163
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,080
the way that there and it could be that

2164
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,239
it crashes quite rapidly

2165
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,360
positive or negatively um as we saw

2166
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,239
earlier with the

2167
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,880
the way that the uh the dynamics work

2168
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,679
and that

2169
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,280
that's quite um that shows that

2170
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,760
the importance of facilitation and the

2171
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,800
importance of

2172
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,960
the way the space is set up the safety

2173
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,480
between participants and all that sort

2174
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,840
of stuff

2175
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,600
cool blue so i know that you said like

2176
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,520
we're not going to unpack the formalism

2177
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,080
of the

2178
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,159
intrinsic value and the extrinsic value

2179
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,520
or at least you said that on the intro

2180
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,080
video

2181
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,040
but um those two things like it makes me

2182
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,280
think the special cases really like

2183
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,440
you know they talked about no intrinsic

2184
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,800
value but what about like

2185
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,280
no extrinsic value like it just always

2186
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,640
reminds me of like what about just

2187
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,000
exploring for

2188
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,120
you know info gain or um you know just

2189
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
out of curiosity to satisfy that like

2190
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
for intrinsic value

2191
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,520
i did note that i was like waiting for

2192
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,239
us like okay

2193
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,040
no risk no ambiguity um then no

2194
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,960
intrinsic it's like the next one

2195
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,280
and uh i wondered if that actually was

2196
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,080
related to

2197
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,920
maximum entropy so it's like given a

2198
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,280
distribution if you have

2199
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,320
no preferences for value then you're

2200
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,640
just

2201
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,719
sampling your preference is to sample

2202
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,320
the distribution

2203
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,360
unadulterated and so that is like max

2204
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,960
info game max ant sampling

2205
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,280
neutrally without preference across a

2206
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,400
distribution

2207
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,239
and so that's very related to

2208
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,320
statistical sampling techniques

2209
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,719
because those computer algorithms have

2210
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:17,920
been designed

2211
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,840
actually without a preference vector in

2212
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,280
mind just to sample

2213
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,080
distributions like monte carlo markov

2214
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,120
chain methods

2215
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,520
and so now we're taking a sampling agent

2216
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,280
you're sampling temperatures

2217
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,760
but you don't want just all temperatures

2218
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,600
for that distribution you want to sample

2219
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,360
repeatedly from body temperature

2220
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,320
however there might be another

2221
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,880
distribution where you do want to have

2222
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,960
a very very exploratory sampling pattern

2223
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,080
let's just see if there's any other

2224
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,000
interesting stuff so here is from

2225
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,520
sophisticated inference

2226
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,840
uh another kind of roll out and then

2227
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,760
here we can see observations

2228
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,120
and then there's different actions that

2229
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,719
can be taken and each of those actions

2230
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,159
would lead to different observations

2231
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,239
and so on and so it gets exponentially

2232
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,719
large and this is just like early chess

2233
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:01,920
algorithms they used to do

2234
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,480
if this then that if this then that and

2235
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,760
they would do these rollouts and then

2236
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,600
they'd prune this branch oh that doesn't

2237
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,719
look that good so i'm not going to

2238
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,000
explore that way

2239
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,480
and since those sort of tree pruning

2240
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,920
chess algorithms there's been

2241
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,080
many developments in chess and other

2242
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,600
algorithms for this kind of decision

2243
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,320
making

2244
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,520
and so here's the structure of the model

2245
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,400
and here's that rollout and then one big

2246
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,199
question is

2247
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,199
how can we look down the branches that

2248
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,560
are most informative

2249
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,880
not just fantasize and dream about the

2250
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,400
one in a billion branches that's the

2251
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,360
best

2252
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,480
not negatively ruminate and get dwelling

2253
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,560
on the one branch that's the worst but

2254
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,000
how can we sample

2255
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,480
information across this branching tree

2256
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,040
pattern

2257
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,560
in a way that leads to effective action

2258
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,400
in the world and then

2259
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,080
here's another integrative plot that

2260
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,760
they made which is showing that

2261
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,199
basically

2262
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,719
there's a few ways to think about active

2263
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,480
inference what it's doing here

2264
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,480
it's minimizing risk and minimizing

2265
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,679
ambiguity okay

2266
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,320
so that's related to this phrasing on

2267
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:00,960
the top

2268
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,440
minimize risk minimize ambiguity okay

2269
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,480
make it safe

2270
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,800
make it clear positive way of saying it

2271
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,400
the negative way is minimize risk

2272
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,840
minimize ambiguity

2273
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,800
so policies states observations states

2274
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,400
are the hidden part of the world

2275
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,640
observations you know photons on my

2276
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,440
retina policies where my eyes move

2277
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,480
and so the risk framing is

2278
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,239
you should be minimizing free energy in

2279
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,320
a way that reduces risk and ambiguity

2280
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,159
about this chain that connects policy

2281
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,600
states and outcomes

2282
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,640
another branch of active inference is

2283
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,719
actually sort of like a yin and yang

2284
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,239
this is like a push pull

2285
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:39,360
it's saying minimize the entropy of the

2286
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,400
distribution of

2287
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,080
outcomes so achieve predictable

2288
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,679
outcomes reduce big reduction on there

2289
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:51,199
and expands here with the information

2290
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,159
gain

2291
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,760
and so instead of hey do something

2292
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,199
that's like creative but

2293
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,280
fyi don't be risky and don't be

2294
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,400
ambiguous

2295
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,880
here is like be as clear as you can and

2296
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
predictable as you can the outcomes

2297
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,120
while being as info gain and creative as

2298
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,560
you possibly can

2299
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,159
and so i like this because it's sort of

2300
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,600
like instead of two things that you want

2301
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,719
to run away from

2302
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,560
and then hopefully you become creative

2303
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,239
in the gap this is like

2304
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,840
something to run away from and something

2305
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,360
to run towards

2306
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,600
so it rephrases that risk and ambiguity

2307
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,800
minimization

2308
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,040
as actually a push pull of a

2309
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,800
minimization of surprise about

2310
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,320
observations

2311
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,239
and a maximization of the information

2312
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,679
gain given

2313
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,239
the um policies that can be carried out

2314
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,440
so i kind of like that

2315
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,080
graphic and then um just in those last

2316
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,440
couple minutes um

2317
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,360
casper and several other authors will be

2318
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,760
on in early april hopefully before then

2319
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,239
as well

2320
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,199
for active 19 and that will be pretty

2321
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,000
cool

2322
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,719
but here's where they walk step by step

2323
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:49,280
m1

2324
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,840
at each time step the agent is inferring

2325
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,199
how hidden states are related to

2326
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,159
outcomes

2327
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,440
then we see that s a o mapping

2328
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,239
and now we have this and d is the

2329
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,520
initial states now we're going to take

2330
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,199
this single time point model

2331
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,600
and use b to ask how states change their

2332
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,960
time

2333
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,920
then we're going to take m 2 that states

2334
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,280
changing through time

2335
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,840
and put it within a bigger model of m3

2336
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,040
which is action

2337
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,040
so policy is influencing how states

2338
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,800
change their time the b matrix

2339
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,880
policy is being selected by what

2340
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,320
minimization of free energy

2341
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
g how do we calculate minimized free

2342
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,719
energy including a preference vector

2343
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,120
c and then we have a prior over policies

2344
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,800
this is related to the affordances

2345
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,159
so now we're not just doing state

2346
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,920
prediction at a moment but through time

2347
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,920
m1 and m2 and we're going to be doing

2348
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,960
policy selection

2349
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,400
on that right now and then where we got

2350
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:40,719
to

2351
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,120
in sophisticated affective inference was

2352
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,080
this m4

2353
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,880
layer which is state observation

2354
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,000
mappings through time

2355
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
or at a given moment and through time

2356
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,600
with a and the b

2357
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,000
and choosing policy using our c

2358
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,280
preference vector

2359
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,239
and g the minimizing of free energy and

2360
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,080
about that free energy

2361
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,920
we're going to have a precision we're

2362
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,440
going to have a prior

2363
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,040
on our precision this is our

2364
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,360
metacognition and here's where valence

2365
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,560
enters the picture

2366
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,239
which is anxiety bad anxiety comes from

2367
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,640
high uncertainty so if you have high

2368
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,520
precision

2369
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,199
on free energy you're going to feel

2370
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,199
better if you have low uncertainty or

2371
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,480
low certainty

2372
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,000
about free energy it's going to lead to

2373
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,640
anxiety not because the expected value

2374
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,400
of the outcomes is negative

2375
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,440
so not within that reward first mindset

2376
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,080
but in the precision first mindset even

2377
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,159
a positive expected value with a high

2378
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:37,199
variance can be anxiety producing

2379
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,400
so we kind of return to the paper

2380
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,320
as being the summation of these two

2381
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,440
citations building

2382
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,600
before just like so many other papers

2383
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,440
are building on citations it's always

2384
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,199
just like tips of icebergs all the way

2385
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,280
down markov citation blankets all the

2386
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,719
way down

2387
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,800
and we can ask our kind of usual sets of

2388
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,760
questions

2389
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,320
and people can provide their closing

2390
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,760
thoughts or questions or

2391
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,640
what would they like addressed in 11.2

2392
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,199
next week just what's something

2393
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,520
fun that anyone or each of you thought

2394
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,960
about today

2395
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,199
and then also to kind of maybe even

2396
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,080
close on a note

2397
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,480
about how we can have accessible

2398
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,719
formalisms for active inference and

2399
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,800
include people in the discussion who

2400
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,159
speak math or not

2401
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,360
who speak english or not so how do we

2402
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,679
communicate it make it exciting build

2403
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,280
those bridges to other areas

2404
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:33,840
any closing thoughts on that

2405
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,520
stephen lots of really good stuff

2406
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,000
i mean i suppose there's some elements

2407
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,560
of this

2408
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,400
where i'd love to find a way i'm trying

2409
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,639
to find a way to take people into

2410
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,679
an activity where you know

2411
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,600
i suppose some of us do that you know

2412
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,199
with play or with

2413
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,440
an exploration different types of

2414
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,120
exploration activities that maybe

2415
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,040
illustrate some of these

2416
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,320
and then they get unpacked after um

2417
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,840
because it may be just some of this

2418
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,880
stuff is in its nature pretty

2419
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,920
involved but they're still good

2420
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,600
um so i like the way you've been

2421
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,000
describing it but maybe there's

2422
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,440
maybe there's something then that this

2423
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,920
now bridges with something else that's

2424
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,719
experiential

2425
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:25,199
cool anyone else have a thought on that

2426
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,159
yeah i think that the questions i would

2427
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,320
like to have the authors or anyone

2428
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,760
familiar with the formalism

2429
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,120
help us on would be how can we

2430
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,159
um communicate and understand the

2431
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,760
differences between partitioning

2432
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,920
risk and ambiguity this way or that way

2433
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,840
how do we know what to apply in what

2434
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,040
scenario

2435
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,040
how does it change how we act how does

2436
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,239
it change how we model

2437
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,560
systems how would we infer it in a

2438
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,520
system

2439
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,120
how do we disconnect the qualia

2440
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,320
the experience of surprise uncertainty

2441
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,760
ambiguity risk

2442
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,000
valence how do we disconnect from the

2443
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,880
qualia

2444
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,960
so that we can apply it to systems that

2445
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,199
are um on the other side of our markov

2446
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,960
blanket systems that are we are not

2447
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,440
experiencing but are acting in a way

2448
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,760
uh in an intentional stance way they're

2449
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,280
acting as if they had these kinds of

2450
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,320
attributes

2451
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,040
well um if there's any other thoughts we

2452
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,840
can definitely

2453
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,880
hear it but otherwise very excellent

2454
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,000
discussion wait stephen do you have

2455
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,600
another point

2456
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,480
oh so everyone thanks for the awesome

2457
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,199
discussion

2458
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,239
there's a uh feedback form in the

2459
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,920
calendar invite if you'd like to take a

2460
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,280
look and fill that out

2461
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,199
otherwise people who are watching it

2462
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,199
live and in replay thanks so much

2463
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,520
means a lot to us and we hope to hear

2464
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,320
your questions

2465
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,840
hear your thoughts so that we can

2466
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,520
address them in 11.2

2467
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,000
and thanks so much for a great 2020. we

2468
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,840
are almost there this is the penultimate

2469
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,960
active stream

2470
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,280
so everyone thanks so much and we'll

2471
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,880
talk later
