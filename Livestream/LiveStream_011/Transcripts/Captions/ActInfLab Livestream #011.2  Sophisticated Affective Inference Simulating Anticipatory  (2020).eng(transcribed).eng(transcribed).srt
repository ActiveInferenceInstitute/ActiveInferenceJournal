00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
hello everyone

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome to the active inference live

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,040
stream it is active inference live

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,559
stream

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,080
11.2 on december 29 2020. this is our

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
last group active inference live stream

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
of the year so thanks so much everyone

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
who is out here today

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
and also um watching live for those who

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,439
are

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,800
and i will share my screen for the

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
participants and here we go

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,720
welcome to the active inference lab

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
everyone we are an experiment in online

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
team communication

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
learning and practice related to active

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,680
inference you can find

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
us at our website on twitter email

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
youtube or our public key based team and

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,719
username

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
this is a recorded and an archived live

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
stream so please provide us with

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,320
feedback so that we can improve on our

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,360
work

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
all backgrounds and perspectives are

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
welcome here and as far as video

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
etiquette for live streams

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,120
mute if there's noise in your background

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,480
raise your hands so that we can hear

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,359
from everybody

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
on the queue and we'll use respectful

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,959
speech behavior

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,119
as i stated this is the last active

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
inference live stream for 2020

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
but in 2021 it's already shaping up to

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,400
be a great

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
year we're going to be meeting tuesdays

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
from 7 to 9 a.m

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
pacific time pst um or pacific time when

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,759
the time changes

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,119
and you can go to this link to learn

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
more when you go to that link you'll see

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,520
this spreadsheet and it has instructions

44
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
on how you can participate

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
as well as which papers we'll be reading

46
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
in which weeks

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,479
so you can see that many authors will be

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,360
joining us

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,119
and hopefully everybody will have the

50
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,880
time to read and digest these papers

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,079
today in active inference stream 11.2

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,759
we are going to have introductions and

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
warm-ups and then

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,840
we'll go into the 11-2 itself we're

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
going to be continuing

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
the discussion of sophisticated

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
affective inference

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,720
the paper of hesp at all 2020 welcome

59
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
sasha

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
we'll run through again the ames claims

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,119
abstract and roadmap

62
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
and the figures and happy new years

63
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,560
everyone thanks

64
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
a lot we'll do new stuff in 2021

65
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
and so stick along let's get to the

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,720
intros and warm-ups we will

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,120
introduce ourself just by giving a short

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
introduction or

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,760
check-in and then passing to somebody

70
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
who hasn't spoken yet

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
so i'll start i'm daniel and i will pass

72
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
it first to a first-time

i've been a lawyer for 27 years i'm

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
trying to use physics principles to help

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
structure social relationships and i

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,560
will pass it to

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040

with canterbury christchurch university

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
and i'm looking at applying the dynamic

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
processes of active inference

86
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,440

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
and community development

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
and helping to understand the dynamics

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
of all of that

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,440

management school

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
and i'm trying to find the ways to

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
connect

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
active inference and systems engineering

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
framework

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,920
cool and ryan uh

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,799
it seems like has the same situation as

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,439
last week

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
but definitely for 2021 we'll

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
figure it out i'll just tell them it

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
still does not

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
work all right let's go to the warm up

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,238
questions and again if anyone else joins

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:20,720
we'll just

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
roll with it so for these warm-up

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
questions

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
raise your hand it'd be great to hear

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
from everybody let's just

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
start off with what are some kinds of

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
agents that we might want to model

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,440
in active inference so just even before

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
reading this paper or after reading the

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
paper what was the kind of system or

130
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,479
type of agent

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
that we might want to frame in this

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,199
way of thinking so emotions makes us

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,639
think about individual people

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,080
but there's other kinds of systems we

135
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
might want to model as well

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
actually scott you were mentioning some

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
interesting types of agents we might be

138
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
considering right before we started so

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
maybe could you pick up there

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,759
sure i was mentioning in law

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,320
it feels like one of the things one of

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
the strategies

143
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,360
is to introduce a provisional agent a

144
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
nominal party

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,280
into an interaction so if you have two

146
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
people interacting you can introduce a

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,840
third

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
by introducing the third it changes the

149
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
system because now a three-party system

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,000
with three-party concerns

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
and that system then will have a

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
different markov blanket as i

153
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,160
am beginning to understand it and so in

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
that

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
context you may be able to do things you

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
can't do in the other

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
through the other markov blanket because

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
it may be able to

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,199
an example is in in tax there's a thing

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
called the like kind exchange

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,479
where i can exchange commercial property

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
for another commercial property tax free

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
well very often you can't find someone

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
with exactly the property you're looking

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
for let's say you have a 20 acre farm

166
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,199
you want a 30 acre farm

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,479
there's nobody around with a 30 acre

168
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,199
farm you use an exchange facilitator and

169
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,720
that means there's a third party in

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
there they take possession of both

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
properties

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,840
and act like a mixing bowl and so

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
putting the details of that aside

174
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,120
it essentially changes that system so it

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
changes your markov blankets

176
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
and so one of the things i'm wondering

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
about is the intentional shifting of the

178
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
markov blankets

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
to increase solution space

180
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
cool so we have all kinds of agents who

181
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,280
are going to be

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,919
interacting and potentially by shifting

183
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,120
the boundaries

184
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
the interfaces between agents and

185
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
wrapping them or sub

186
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
partitioning them it's possible to make

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
new kinds of swaps

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
within existing infrastructures or new

189
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
ones

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,199
so anyone can just raise their hand i'll

191
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
just put up the second

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
question which is another general one

193
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
which is how can we learn

194
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
and communicate the technical aspects of

195
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
active inference in an accessible

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
fashion stephen go ahead i don't know if

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
i'm going to explain how to do this but

198
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,479
i'll explain the challenge which

199
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
um um i think it's important to

200
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
overcome it because it's so valuable is

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
i was just in a conversation

202
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
and trying to talk about systems and how

203
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
we can how we think about systems when

204
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,000
we

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
engage um in communities and thinking

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,479
about how we

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,080
understand the world there's a lot of

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
stuff in in the world of kind of the

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
social arts and participatory theater

210
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,400
where it's like

211
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
we need to do something with the system

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
and then it flips to

213
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
we're all a living system it's the body

214
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,840
knows and

215
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
we just know how it is we just need to

216
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
listen to the body and it will know

217
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
and um it's both you know it's

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
we're in this dynamic niche of which

219
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
there's an awful lot of stuff we don't

220
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
know

221
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
yet we can tap into our body

222
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
and the way that our body works and

223
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,560
there's

224
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,240
a way that we construct meaning in the

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
world so i suppose

226
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,360
trying to find a way to take case

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,479
studies

228
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,240
and show how it can help

229
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
will be really useful

230
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
thank you sasha

231
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
yeah um thanks steven i really um

232
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
i agree with what you said and uh

233
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
ironically or i guess in a very meta way

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,160
um active inference is the answer to

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
that question because

236
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
um through like closing the loop

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
and introducing action into the system

238
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
we can better

239
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
understand thinking about the system and

240
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,759
so i think that's a

241
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,720
really great point that um case studies

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,360
and

243
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,319
really specific applications of active

244
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,120
inference

245
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
are going to be the best way to teach

246
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,640
and learn

247
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
about it so yeah i think that's a great

248
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,958
point

249
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
cool blue so just to kind of piggyback

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,360
on that

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
i think um and maybe tie in some of what

252
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
scott was saying earlier

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
when we think about modeling in active

254
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
inference it's interesting to think

255
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
about

256
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
scaling this not in the way that we

257
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,640
talked about when we were talking about

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
scaling active inference but

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
in the way that like we have several

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
different systems even just existing

261
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,880
within the body

262
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,399
right like the input and output of the

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
stomach and the spleen and the liver and

264
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,720
and

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
you know also like the brain and the the

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
somatic awareness right to speak to kind

267
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
of what what stephen was saying earlier

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,040
so

269
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
it's interesting to try to think about

270
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
modeling systems within systems

271
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
in in active inference yep

272
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
and actually this brain and body uh

273
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
dialogue

274
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
and the multi-systems approach in the

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
way that it doesn't say well

276
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,279
everyone told you the brain was

277
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
important actually it's the body no it's

278
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
actually it's both and similarly it's

279
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
like quantitative

280
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
and qualitative and so it's not just

281
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,000
that we're going

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
to throw out one for the other but we

283
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
want to think

284
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,519
across that division and integrate them

285
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
that's the beyond internalism and

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
externalism and

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
integrating the sciences with the

288
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
humanities and other things that we're

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,839
kind of talking about

290
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,480
scott i just put in the chat there was

291
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
an article that came out

292
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
december 4th in science magazine called

293
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
the exploitative segregation of plant

294
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,880
roots

295
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
and so this is helps with that second

296
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,480
question

297
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
learn communicating it what it was

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
talking about is the way that plant

299
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,399
roots

300
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
grow specifically you have two trees

301
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,000
next to each other each is a system each

302
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,519
has a markov blanket

303
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,360
they're growing next to each other and

304
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
they differentiate their plant growth

305
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,720
roots to optimize statistically

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
their nutrient uptake and so they don't

307
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
go and intrude on other

308
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
plants roots space because that would

309
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
not be optimized for them because they'd

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
be putting more resources into growing

311
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,120
further roots

312
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
and and but getting fewer nutrients

313
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
because they'd be nearer the other plant

314
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
and so to me i looked at that and i went

315
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
wow that's a real nice way to understand

316
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,079
the

317
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
dynamics of two different organisms

318
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
interacting with statistical gradients

319
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
there it's a nutritional gradient

320
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
specifically that felt to me like it was

321
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
a nice way to kind of introduce that

322
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
idea of the of the contact between the

323
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
two different systems

324
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,519
cool so what i'm going to take from the

325
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
second question and all the answers to

326
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
it is that

327
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
through examples that are accessible and

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
at hand we can all start to

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
learn more about the relational side of

330
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
active inference and also

331
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,079
the statistical and the quantitative

332
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
because both those

333
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
sides are going to be learning journeys

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
for everybody because no one's going to

335
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
know all the statistics no one's going

336
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,279
to know all the

337
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,000
deep relational pieces that are so

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
familiar to performance artists in other

339
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
areas

340
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
the last question on the warm-up is what

341
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
is something that you are wondering

342
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
about or would like to have resolved by

343
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
today's discussion

344
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
so one thing i'm wondering about is um

345
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,079
was raised right before we started as

346
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,079
well is like how do we think about

347
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,720
emotion

348
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,279
or this parameter in systems that aren't

349
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,079
us

350
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
and i'm also even wondering whether the

351
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,440
emotions we experience

352
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
are these parameters and how do we name

353
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
parameters or talk about parameters of

354
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
mathematical models

355
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
in a way such that they're recognizable

356
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
and capture meaning

357
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,639
but also don't constrain or sort of

358
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
uh falsely limit what it means to be

359
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
that term

360
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
so we can get into a map territory issue

361
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,480
when we're talking about

362
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
computational models of emotion just

363
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
like we could with consciousness

364
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
blue

365
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
so just to kind of piggyback on what you

366
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
were saying about

367
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
um emotions like i i don't know as i'm

368
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,920
starting to study more about emotion

369
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
like i'm a

370
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
logic and science kind of researcher and

371
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
so but learning about emotion just

372
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,639
reading personally

373
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,839
a lot of it seems to be like non-verbal

374
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,639
right and so how do you like quantify or

375
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,760
even measure

376
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
emotion on a scale when it's it's really

377
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,040
like you know

378
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,760
you're feeling some you know primitive

379
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
thing from you know when you were

380
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
left in your crib as a child that you

381
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,639
have no words for because you didn't

382
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,079
have words for it at that time

383
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
and so how do you kind of like like

384
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
impart some kind of meaning or

385
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
quantitative scale

386
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
on something that that maybe there's not

387
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
even language for

388
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
yes it's almost like the uh discredited

389
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,160
but

390
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
guiding three-part brain model so it's

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
like the most

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
prefrontal is the numbers in that level

393
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
of formalization and then a little bit

394
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
lower we have language but then below

395
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
that the substrate is actually

396
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
experience and that's the embodied

397
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,839
experience

398
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,760
that may or may not even have words to

399
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
express it and then we can look at

400
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,079
expressions like poetry or speech

401
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,720
and is there a way to get more precise

402
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,480
or is it merely an expression that's

403
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
arising from an emotional state

404
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
but the emotional state isn't a number

405
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,839
it's not a words it's actually something

406
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,639
that's more

407
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
deep scott

408
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
i was wondering if with regard to dance

409
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
and performance

410
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,839
whether there are ways of communicating

411
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
because we talk about embodied i wonder

412
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
about in coding

413
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,839
so can emotions be encoded in dance in a

414
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
way that they can't be encoded in speech

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,360
or other movement

416
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
so that it becomes a surrogate or kind

417
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
of that mirror neuron idea

418
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
that you're projecting out an emotion by

419
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,360
the projection of your body position

420
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,160
the morphology being the encoding of the

421
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
emotion

422
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
cool question yeah stephen definitely

423
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
yeah i think this also relates to this

424
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
question of

425
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
um affect and dimensionality

426
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,639
so maybe there's a way that when we take

427
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
a perspective on things

428
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,680
we kind of look at a dimensional

429
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
approach but it can be encoded

430
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
in some sort of spatial um

431
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,600
affective way and maybe those dimensions

432
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
aren't

433
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
they they they become light dimensions

434
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
but the encoding is is not as

435
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,199
linear as that a bit like color space

436
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
when we see colors the space of colors

437
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,199
you can encode it

438
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,240
in sort of in in lightness and two

439
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
different types of coloured dimensions

440
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,680
but the way that it's encoded is

441
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
when people look at perception it's not

442
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,519
it's not linear in that space so maybe

443
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,160
there's like an

444
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
affect space which somehow encodes in a

445
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,439
in a way which is non-dimensional

446
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,639
so might oh sorry go ahead go so

447
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,000
my aesthetics be

448
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,440
provisional um efforts at encoding

449
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,079
very nice to bring in the aesthetics and

450
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,199
the intuition

451
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
because intuition is that which can't be

452
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
expressed it's sort of like the

453
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
dark matter it's the submerged part of

454
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
the iceberg

455
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
but those reflect the deepest priors

456
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,120
potentially

457
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
that help us search through the state

458
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
space that as we've been exploring

459
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
is vast to do the exponential rollout of

460
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,279
a chess game

461
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,560
is gonna be hard it's gonna be more um

462
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,040
basically states than you can keep track

463
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
of however

464
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
if you think i feel good about this uh

465
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,320
arrangement of the pieces

466
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
then with just a simple affect and a

467
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
limited rollout you may be able to do

468
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,759
very well so again ryan we're not sure

469
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,399
but we'll

470
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
figure this one out okay uh

471
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,519
let's is that just one other thing is

472
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,199
that like the holographic principle

473
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,399
potentially that

474
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
on a system the information about the

475
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,639
system is displayed on its surface

476
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,560
is a markov blanket potentially that

477
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
surface that you've observed to

478
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,880
understand the system inside

479
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
i believe so and chris fields who will

480
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,880
be

481
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
coming onto the stream we'll be talking

482
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
about a paper that's going to be

483
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,519
uh in early march chris

484
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,399
has done a lot of holographic markov

485
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,040
blanket

486
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,680
research so let's keep on thinking about

487
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,720
that because that's very

488
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
interesting i'm not exactly sure but

489
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,839
yeah

490
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
hopefully we'll figure that one out

491
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
within a few months so

492
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
the paper itself and then again we'll

493
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
have enough time just to

494
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
hear whatever people are thinking but uh

495
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
sophisticated affect of inference we

496
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,639
talked about it in 11.0 and 11.1

497
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
and the paper is about combining these

498
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,720
two previous threads of research which

499
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
were sophisticated

500
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,560
active inference which is sophisticated

501
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
meaning deep through time

502
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,599
with affective inference or active

503
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,959
inference where there's an emotional

504
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
state component

505
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
the abstract they state that and the

506
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,079
roadmap

507
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
of this relatively short paper is pretty

508
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,679
short

509
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,119
so today let's think about how these two

510
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,359
threads which are distinct threads

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
that's why they each were their own

512
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,760
paper

513
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,079
can be combined into something that is

514
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,440
in front of us today

515
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
which is this paper that is literally

516
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
summating these two threads of research

517
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,280
and then we can think about a few

518
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
directions that

519
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,160
this research makes us think about

520
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
whether developing more advanced

521
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
simulations so just asking which

522
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
parameters of the simulation could be

523
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
improved or how could this be expanded

524
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,679
or generalized but also

525
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,320
on the more functional side we can look

526
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
to computational psychiatry because

527
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
we're talking about emotions

528
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
if we are and also even non-human agents

529
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,000
like robots

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
so a few different directions we can go

531
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
and to

532
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
structure that discussion it could be

533
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,679
useful for us to

534
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
have a few examples like two or three or

535
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
four

536
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
of sophisticated affective inference

537
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,080
agents

538
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
conventional or unconventional so

539
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,760
certainly one of them could be a person

540
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
but we'll think of that person being in

541
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
a certain context

542
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,799
and then we'll return to these examples

543
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
that we come up with right now

544
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
as we go through the slides ahead we'll

545
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,400
just return it to example a b c

546
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
and then when we're talking about

547
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
parameters we'll be able to say okay so

548
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
in the example a this matrix would

549
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
represent this in the example b

550
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,480
it would represent that so who has a

551
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
thought or a suggestion on what would be

552
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,679
like a cool

553
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
system to bring into this mixture so

554
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
again one of the examples will be a

555
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
person

556
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
and people can suggest what they think

557
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
that person's like story or

558
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
situation should be kind of like an

559
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
improv scene and then also if people

560
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
want to provide

561
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
an unconventional system that'd be

562
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,200
good too so

563
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,039
any thoughts on that

564
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
alex

565
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
i think maybe we can consider

566
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,840
next system scale and see on team

567
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,720
behavior

568
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,360
great and so try to define

569
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,799
these concepts in a meaning of

570
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
team communication insight and outside

571
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
communication with

572
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,000
different subsystem of organization

573
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
thanks for suggesting that so let's do

574
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
um example a

575
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,760
is going to be an individual human so

576
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,480
that will be

577
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
hopefully grounding us to our lived

578
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,520
experience

579
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
into realistic situations that people

580
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
and comic book characters find

581
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
themselves in

582
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
the second example b is going to be team

583
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
communication

584
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
so we'll kind of develop the story but

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
we'll see maybe the team is a startup

586
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,919
team or maybe they're a research team

587
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
or maybe it's uh just an affinity group

588
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
about some other topic and then

589
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
the third example let's think about

590
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
something more organizational and

591
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
institutional so let's think about that

592
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
third example being potentially like

593
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,960
a large company large enough to have a

594
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
legal department and an hr department

595
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
let's just say

596
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
so we have three examples which is going

597
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
to be the person the team

598
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
and the institution slash organization

599
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,080
three levels of analysis

600
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,360
and then as we walk through these

601
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,840
formalisms let's see where might be

602
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
like strengths weaknesses limitations

603
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,960
insights etc stephen

604
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
and i suppose you could apply it to all

605
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
of those this idea you know we have this

606
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,559
vision

607
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,320
and mission i mean that's more for an

608
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
organization the mission

609
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,559
and the vision transfers down to a team

610
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
which might be the purpose and the roles

611
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,120
and then you've got the kind of the

612
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
character and the kind of

613
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
you know meaningfulness for the

614
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
individual so you've got

615
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
this temple depth being sort of

616
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
expressed across all of those levels of

617
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
scale

618
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
yeah exactly like the examples in this

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
case they're not three disjoint examples

620
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,600
in fact the individual

621
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,559
could be on a team in an organization so

622
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,679
all three of these

623
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,799
examples that we're going to be talking

624
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,880
about could be nested within each other

625
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,799
or they could be disjoint and so that

626
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,480
really highlights why it's so important

627
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
to have a multi-scale perspective

628
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,760
because even when we're talking about

629
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
the individual we're going to be

630
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
thinking about the individual

631
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
it's the system of interest it's what

632
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
we're talking about it's the interface

633
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
we're talking about the markov blanket

634
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
that we're talking about

635
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,679
but it's inherently embedded within a

636
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,559
larger system

637
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,080
so we're not going to forget the company

638
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,679
when we're talking about the individual

639
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,080
and vice versa so it's always all the

640
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
scales happening at once but then

641
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
depending on the system of interest

642
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
or the markup blanket or the level of

643
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
course graining that is being

644
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
uh performed in that specific analysis

645
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,760
it will uh we'll dive into the details

646
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,440
as they present themselves but that will

647
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
be kind of

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
fun so here's figure one

649
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
in the paper and we went a little bit in

650
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,360
the previous

651
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
videos into some of these sub components

652
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
because this is like

653
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,520
m4 and there's m123 as well

654
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
that lead up to m4 but just to recap

655
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,760
what each of these pieces are

656
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
o at the bottom is observation and s

657
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
is the state that inference is being

658
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
done upon

659
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,159
so this is where those examples come

660
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,240
into play so in the individual

661
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
case the state that's that something

662
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,080
might be having uh

663
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
that an individual might be performing

664
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
inference on it could be is it sunny or

665
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,919
cloudy

666
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,000
outside and maybe that changes how you

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
feel or it could be a hidden state like

668
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,400
is this person um happy with me or sad

669
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,200
with me

670
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
um a is the mapping of

671
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
how these hidden states relate to the

672
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
observations

673
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
so whether at the individual level it's

674
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
sunny outside and then the observations

675
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
are perceived with certain probability

676
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,039
um and then yeah people just raise their

677
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,240
hand if they want to like

678
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,520
jump onto another example or uh

679
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
you know ask a question about how some

680
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,159
of these variables might interact i'll

681
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,840
just walk through them with no example

682
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
and then we'll go to the example pieces

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
b is how

684
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
the states are inferred to change

685
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
through time

686
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
so the b is like the probability that

687
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
given that at state one

688
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,159
it was in such and such a state that at

689
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,679
the next time point it would be at a

690
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,039
different state

691
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,880
now you is a piece that connects to be

692
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
and this is the policy and so the policy

693
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
is something that influences how states

694
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
are likely to transform into each other

695
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
the policy itself is downstream of the

696
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
agent's decisions

697
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
about uh which actions to engage in it

698
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,840
turns out that the way that

699
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,159
the action selection is chosen at the

700
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
level of analysis whichever

701
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,799
blanket that we're talking about that is

702
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,840
action selection guided by this set of

703
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,480
parameters

704
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
the g is that expected free energy

705
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,159
that's being minimized

706
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
and that also covers up the c matrix

707
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
which is like the preferences

708
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
the gamma is the precision or the

709
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,320
uncertainty

710
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,600
whether it's like one over or not and

711
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
basically this relates to how precise

712
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,200
the agent believes they are

713
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
in their estimate of which policies to

714
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,360
be pursuing

715
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
given this chain of things happening

716
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
down here

717
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
a um is the uh

718
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,240
is the okay sorry about that at each

719
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
time point in this model because i want

720
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,240
to i want to

721
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
be general but i want to be specific

722
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
about what this model actually did

723
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
at each time point in this model that's

724
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
being captured by

725
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,440
this top sort of pinkish area this is

726
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
the affective inference

727
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,679
question where the affect of the agent

728
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,960
is

729
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
relating into how it simulates rolling

730
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,000
out

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
in this whole internal gray zone all

732
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,919
this these future time points

733
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,960
and um then each model tick

734
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
is going to be like moving from the left

735
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,159
to the right

736
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
and at each time point in this model the

737
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,039
agent is going to be running out some

738
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
uh possibilities for what could happen

739
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,480
in the future so stephen and then we'll

740
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,440
think about the examples

741
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,039
yes so i was going to sort of bring an

742
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,600
example there so maybe

743
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
um well one thing that's come up and i

744
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
i've been doing some work with this

745
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
metaphors of movement and andrew austin

746
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
who does that work he talks a lot about

747
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,279
how anxiety he finds anxiety

748
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,159
is often related to people having trying

749
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:28,559
to have

750
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,240
elevated status like they're trying to

751
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
have an elevated status

752
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
and it's and it makes a lot of sense for

753
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,760
this because it could also be like

754
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
you feel like you put yourself in an

755
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,000
elevated status and

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,080
you're always going to be slightly

757
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
uncertain

758
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,919
unless maybe you're a king or someone

759
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
about that status being maintained

760
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,559
so being put on a pedestal can be so

761
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
there could be something about western

762
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
society and status which is partly why

763
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,880
we have this

764
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
overarching anxiety because

765
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
um and it would make sense in a way

766
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,080
because there's

767
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,279
always a sense of never being completely

768
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,360
clear about whether your status is going

769
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,799
to be maintained

770
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,360
so i thought that's kind of interesting

771
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
and this would sort of tie

772
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
would support that kind of observation

773
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,720
yep so status or um various other

774
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,039
sort of social approval metrics we can

775
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,640
think of it's like

776
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
the water we swim in as social organisms

777
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,799
so just like a company might be wanting

778
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,640
to stay above water financially

779
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,279
at least that department a person has to

780
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,919
be staying

781
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,159
above water reputationally we can think

782
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,120
of it in

783
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
that way and so again let's go to the

784
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,039
examples and think about these different

785
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,480
systems and what they might be

786
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,919
performing inference on scott

787
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,919
just gonna i'm just gonna comment on the

788
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,520
status

789
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,320
issue that it feels like then you can

790
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,840
adjust so you're making serial

791
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,960
adjustments right you're trying to

792
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,799
minimize the free energy minimize the

793
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,240
difference between your expectation and

794
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
the

795
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,320
reality you're experiencing as i

796
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
understand it so

797
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,039
with that overall effective status you

798
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,080
can do

799
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
what feels like compensating controls

800
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
so you could if you feel like you're at

801
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,480
risk

802
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,279
vis-a-vis the one presentation you're

803
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
making of self

804
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,080
you can rake in other presentations of

805
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,480
self to complement or supplement or

806
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
mitigate the impression of one of them

807
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,840
because

808
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
because you have myriad affective

809
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,840
projections that you're making

810
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,039
simultaneously so it feels like if you

811
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,399
have an awareness of this

812
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,240
it can help you with that presentation

813
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,760
of self question

814
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,960
by understanding that you okay this

815
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,559
effective status that i'm presenting

816
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,440
is not getting me where i want to be

817
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,559
inside

818
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
so let me leverage another one which is

819
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,559
contiguous or a neighboring

820
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,640
affect again i'll call it an affectation

821
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
here but i mean in a

822
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,080
presentation of a markov binding site

823
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
um so it feels like it gives a strategy

824
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,760
for

825
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
hybridizing and synthesizing your

826
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
presentation of your

827
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,880
markov blankets anyway keep going yes

828
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
okay so let's go to the examples and

829
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,080
think about how these three

830
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
potentially even overlapping systems are

831
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
going to be carrying this out

832
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,320
and an individual at each time point

833
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
maybe let's just say this is every

834
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
second or each minute

835
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
a team might be interested in organizing

836
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,720
on the multi-day and the organization is

837
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
going to be more explicitly thinking

838
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,840
okay quarter to quarter that's going to

839
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,120
be our next time that we're going to do

840
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,679
all this

841
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
simulation so it's not surprising that

842
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
as things get bigger

843
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,120
they also get slower so that's a common

844
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,799
theme we're going to see

845
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
so the individual's affect is really

846
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,000
where

847
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
this emotional inspiration comes from so

848
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,080
there there's the closest mapping

849
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,679
between affect and emotion

850
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
but let's think about that team and the

851
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,120
large company example

852
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,600
well affect again and valence

853
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
specifically is like that plus

854
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,960
to minus axis so is this team going well

855
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,039
is this company going well and if

856
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,640
someone says yeah we're burning money at

857
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,080
an incredible rate it's unsustainable

858
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,960
but it's going well

859
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
because i have a uh believed trajectory

860
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,799
that we're going to go on where we

861
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,480
actually pull out of the nosedive and do

862
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,440
xyz

863
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
so they can still think it's going

864
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,039
perfectly well even if the instantaneous

865
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,919
rate of loss

866
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
is high and then on the flip side you

867
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,039
can imagine

868
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
a team or a large company where

869
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
instantaneously their state looks like

870
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
it's good it looks like they have a lot

871
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,360
of cash or it looks like they have a lot

872
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
of people involved in the team

873
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,679
but they still feel negative about it so

874
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,080
that

875
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
disjoint between the affect about a

876
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,159
situation and the state of the situation

877
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,080
is one thing to take into account

878
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
now let's connect the affect at all

879
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,399
these levels to precision estimates

880
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,039
at different levels um especially in the

881
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,799
active inference framework which

882
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
frames what organisms or any system is

883
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,360
doing as precision seeking

884
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,720
high anxiety is going to be coming from

885
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,039
having low precision now it's not that

886
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,159
we want zero

887
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,000
um uncertainty we want to have this

888
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,679
controlled novelty sort of u

889
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,240
curve but it can be clearly uh

890
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,320
situations where your precision is too

891
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
low and then you're surprised by what is

892
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,200
being uh emitted to you in the niche

893
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,960
whether it's your team operating

894
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,640
environment or the company's operating

895
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
environment

896
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,960
and then if your precision it can't get

897
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
too high because if you're overly

898
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
precise and you're incorrect

899
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,960
then you're going to die like if you

900
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
have a super super accurate

901
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,559
understanding but you're just delusional

902
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
then you're going to fall off the cliff

903
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,880
so in a way what shapes this precision

904
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
is actually the real world which prunes

905
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,640
beliefs that are not functionally

906
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,159
associated with success in the real

907
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
world steven and then we'll come back to

908
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
it

909
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,399
yeah i really like this um this idea of

910
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,159
thinking about how we understand

911
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,600
ourselves within all of this

912
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
so for instance yeah if you could move

913
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,039
between

914
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,440
a different regime of attention or sense

915
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
of self

916
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
which could be like what happens when we

917
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,320
do sense making maybe even change the

918
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,000
operating metaphors

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
of the person you know who am i at the

920
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,679
moment you know

921
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,120
what's the context what's my situational

922
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
um attunement what's my team's purpose

923
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
what's what's the operating metaphor for

924
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,960
this team

925
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,120
are we like all driving together in a

926
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,159
car or we

927
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,399
are we building ourselves a fortress you

928
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
know and that would

929
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,480
that almost could give a way to jump in

930
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
and out of these kind of

931
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,919
affective engines if that makes sense so

932
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,600
as you've seen over time how's it going

933
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,120
what's the policy

934
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,480
um and what's the the affective states

935
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
um that sort of thought about in a

936
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,760
certain future and they

937
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
could almost then say okay what if i

938
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
shifted

939
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
maybe that's where you need the body

940
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
like the metaphor i'm working with

941
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,679
and then what does that do and um and

942
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,440
maybe at times that's when you need to

943
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,960
work with a group to be able to do that

944
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
because maybe

945
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
an individual can't just keep

946
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
flipping backwards and forwards you need

947
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
to work as a group to do that kind of

948
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,840
sense

949
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
making across different times

950
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,279
cool scott i had a question for sasha

951
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,960
you were mentioning pruning but you

952
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
weren't talking about dendritic pruning

953
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,600
but i wonder if dendritic pruning is

954
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
describable by what

955
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
the type of pruning you were just

956
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,320
talking about because my understanding

957
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
of dendritic pruning

958
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
very minimal is that you know during the

959
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,120
day you have the growth of

960
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,960
dendrites and then this pruned back

961
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,559
selectively

962
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,120
um and that that is influenced by your

963
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,000
externality

964
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,840
each day the growth is influenced by

965
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
your externality and then there's this

966
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,840
pruning process that feels like it's

967
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
iterating itself at that

968
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,279
at that level is that describable by

969
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,399
this here

970
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,320
is that another scale or is it something

971
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,279
else that's going on there

972
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,840
um yeah i think that's a really

973
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,279
interesting analogy

974
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,799
that that's um kind of what's happening

975
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,360
there

976
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,200
i i don't know if i would uh kind of

977
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,679
draw all the same parallels

978
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,039
um yeah just from a mechanistic

979
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,159
standpoint but

980
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,679
it's true that kind of in the

981
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,200
uh in the generalities that um

982
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
uh as connections are formed during the

983
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,399
day

984
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,720
then um they're pruned or lost

985
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,240
um as they're not used and yet

986
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,600
we think that happens at night um but

987
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,679
yet i think that's an interesting um

988
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,960
analogy to draw that

989
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
it's uh beliefs about the

990
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,279
world that aren't um

991
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,919
i don't know useful or supported are the

992
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,320
ones that then get pruned

993
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,080
yes and oh um i was also gonna say

994
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,360
uh the other aspect

995
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,760
is i think we know uh from our lived

996
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,720
experience is that

997
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,080
it's really um it

998
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,840
it's really interesting when people can

999
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,480
be uh holding certain beliefs

1000
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,600
and not um not know that

1001
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
and then when they finally kind of

1002
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,359
confront the the belief

1003
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,639
um it kind of yeah

1004
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,760
there's a bit of a breakdown and um to

1005
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,159
me that that moment is very interesting

1006
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,480
um when uh people have to confront

1007
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
certain beliefs that

1008
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,839
um maybe they didn't even recognize that

1009
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
they held

1010
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,359
so there's a phase change and a

1011
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,599
recontextualization

1012
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,159
piece and the last part you said sasha

1013
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,359
and the pruning

1014
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
is using a network analogy so it's like

1015
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
pruning connections between different

1016
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,719
aspects of the system and so let's think

1017
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,079
about the individual

1018
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,560
in the uh office having a conversation

1019
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,359
with somebody

1020
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
the query the prompt to them let's just

1021
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,639
say is how are you feeling

1022
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,639
and that is a query that's presented to

1023
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,879
the interface which is their ears

1024
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,520
and also their vision and other aspects

1025
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,680
the query is presented to the interface

1026
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,240
about what's inside of the interface and

1027
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,520
now what's happening inside of the

1028
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
interface

1029
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
is a generative model of that query

1030
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,920
presenting system

1031
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,680
so inside of the person there's a

1032
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
generative model of for example the

1033
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,359
person who's talking to them asking that

1034
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:13,920
question

1035
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
and we know it's a generative model

1036
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
because if they covered up their eyes or

1037
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,000
if they

1038
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,680
only heard part of it they might be able

1039
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,079
to still recover what was being asked

1040
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,839
but in either case there's a generative

1041
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,599
model inside of the interface

1042
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,000
and a prompt is being presented as an

1043
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,720
observation

1044
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,320
stimuli to the interface that's querying

1045
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,520
how the system will respond so speech is

1046
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,320
action

1047
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
and that's not even a legal claim it's

1048
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
that it's a motor claim

1049
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
speech is generated by a motor behavior

1050
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
it's not your hand but it is a motor

1051
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
behavior and for some people it is with

1052
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,200
their hand

1053
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,040
so various body parts can be used to

1054
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,320
communicate

1055
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
let's think about that interface in the

1056
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
process of the team

1057
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
and the company so potentially for these

1058
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
organizational entities

1059
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
the interface could be like a consultant

1060
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
who interfaces with specific questions

1061
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,400
but instead of a counselor who asks how

1062
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,480
are you feeling to an individual

1063
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
there might be questions that could be

1064
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
asked to the team

1065
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
and there can be questions that could be

1066
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,119
asked such that only

1067
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,119
the team could respond and someone might

1068
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
say well how could you ask a question

1069
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
that only a team could respond to aren't

1070
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,160
teams composed of people

1071
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,599
there's two things i'd say there the

1072
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,200
first is that that's the reductionist

1073
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,680
argument

1074
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,440
the reductionist slide is like what do

1075
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
you mean get a response from a person

1076
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,160
aren't you just going to get a response

1077
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,839
from skin cells and neurons

1078
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,680
it's like right that's what i'm trying

1079
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
to get that response

1080
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,920
so even if the response can be

1081
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,079
reductionistically understood as being

1082
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,760
composed of smaller pieces

1083
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
that's not a surprise that should be

1084
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
taken for default so

1085
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,520
questions can be asked to teams that of

1086
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,000
course humans are going to be responding

1087
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
to as well but also we can think about

1088
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,160
kind of like colony phenotypes

1089
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
we can think about team phenotypes so

1090
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
for example let's just say i ask a

1091
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,119
question to a team

1092
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,359
like uh what did you have for lunch or

1093
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,560
what do you think the most exciting

1094
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,320
project is for next year

1095
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,119
and then i looked at the distribution of

1096
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,640
how long it took people to respond to

1097
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,280
that message that's like a colony level

1098
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
trait it's a collective trait

1099
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,240
that distribution is composed of people

1100
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,040
acting

1101
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,720
but no individual can dictate what that

1102
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
distributional parameter is

1103
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,880
so it's like a measurement of let's just

1104
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,839
say some blood

1105
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,760
cells you flow a million blood cells

1106
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,119
through and then you can get a

1107
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,920
distribution

1108
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,520
across all of those blood cells so it's

1109
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
like you're querying in the aggregate

1110
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,240
even though each individual sub piece uh

1111
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,040
could have been

1112
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,280
following that distribution or uh

1113
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,480
somewhat of an outlier

1114
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
so those are the kinds of things that

1115
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
you could ask

1116
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,560
presenting to a team or an organization

1117
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
and the team of the organization is

1118
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
going to have a generative model of its

1119
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,320
niche

1120
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,079
so if it's involved in a certain type of

1121
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,000
consultancy where it paid a lot of money

1122
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,440
and it really respects what the person

1123
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
is going to be

1124
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
uh doing then maybe when you ask them

1125
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,800
the question what's the most exciting

1126
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
project and why

1127
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
they give one response or what's the

1128
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,040
most challenging

1129
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
project of this year and why was it

1130
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
challenging whereas if you were in a

1131
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,839
different context you'd give a different

1132
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,640
response

1133
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
because the generative model of the

1134
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
system across that interface is very

1135
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
different so the response that it gives

1136
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
will be different

1137
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
and it's going to be querying different

1138
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
things and externalizing different

1139
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,400
aspects of itself could be accurate

1140
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,359
could be

1141
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,320
inaccurate scott so one of the things

1142
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,400
that raises is i've been in some of the

1143
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
work that i've done in cyber security

1144
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
i've been

1145
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,440
parsing principles versus ethics versus

1146
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
norms

1147
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,400
and so it's kind of interesting in

1148
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,480
querying a group they're going to get an

1149
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,079
average right you'll get a gaussian

1150
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,680
distribution or whatever of

1151
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,359
opinion and you'll then it'll be

1152
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
informative um

1153
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
in and so norms i assert

1154
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,320
for these purposes that their behaviors

1155
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,640
with behavioral expectations that are

1156
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
set through the past what was normal

1157
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,359
and one of the assertions i make is

1158
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,040
principles and again they're assertions

1159
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
there's different overlap

1160
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,119
here the principles are institutional

1161
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
assertions of aspiration

1162
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
and ethics also are aspirational but

1163
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,480
they're human assertions about

1164
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,200
human behaviors that's the distinction i

1165
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,440
make whatever words you want to use

1166
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
and so it's interesting in the context

1167
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,599
where you're talking about about

1168
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,359
querying a group

1169
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,320
because there's different evidentiary

1170
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
group

1171
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
chunks that you'll look at right

1172
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
normative you'll be looking if

1173
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,040
according those definitions on hey

1174
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,640
what'd we do before

1175
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
and would we do against the set of

1176
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,640
standards that said the principles may

1177
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,920
be more aspirational

1178
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,359
and it may be you know how we doing

1179
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,280
towards that thing

1180
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,839
but it's not necessarily based on what

1181
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,280
was done before you can

1182
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
you know you say our principles are more

1183
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,359
aspirational than what we did before

1184
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,839
so it's interesting just that interface

1185
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,119
of what's used

1186
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,119
in the discussion of the group dynamics

1187
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,640
and how that relates to what you were

1188
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
just describing which is the querying

1189
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,920
of the group and individuals the framing

1190
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
of the nature of that

1191
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,440
output you're getting from the group is

1192
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,880
kind of interesting based on that

1193
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,839
question asked

1194
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,599
right what do you do before is one

1195
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,200
question what do you wish to do in the

1196
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,720
future is a different question

1197
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,760
yes so that query could be what do you

1198
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
regularly do

1199
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
so again it could be the person in the

1200
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,920
office and someone says what is your

1201
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
morning routine that's something we

1202
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,280
talked about in a previous week

1203
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
or it could be a query to a team what is

1204
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,640
your onboarding

1205
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,800
routine or how do you welcome new

1206
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,760
members

1207
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,920
um and then this question of the

1208
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
aspirational and the norm so

1209
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,560
it's funny because norms can mean what's

1210
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
normal

1211
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
it means what's expected that's what has

1212
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,480
happened

1213
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,200
in the past because what's not normal

1214
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,480
you know if not if not the past

1215
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,119
what's normal but at the same time

1216
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,480
normative

1217
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,760
means uh what should be so a normative

1218
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,200
claim should be like i think people

1219
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
should be treated this way

1220
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,359
and that may or may not reflect what has

1221
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,800
been the norm

1222
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,400
so people all of uh belief systems make

1223
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,440
normative claims

1224
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
that sometimes are consistent with norms

1225
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,640
and sometimes

1226
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,359
are almost radically divergent from

1227
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,000
norms

1228
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,240
someone says the norm is a but i think

1229
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,040
the norm

1230
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,359
should be b so i'm making a normative

1231
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,720
claim about the norms and it should be

1232
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
different and so these are all

1233
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,359
interesting things to uh yeah scott

1234
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,200
so one big gap that's out there in the

1235
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,680
world right now is the gap between

1236
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,560
law and what the interactions that

1237
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,760
technology allows

1238
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,520
and i'm talking about fractally up and

1239
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,119
down the chain

1240
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,040
reproductive interactions biomedical

1241
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,880
population wide all these different

1242
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,440
things the law is really lagging

1243
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,960
okay so one of the things that's

1244
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
interesting about this is

1245
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,480
there a possibility that this kind of

1246
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,720
analysis can help us to discover

1247
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,118
norms that would guide

1248
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,000
groups and those norms if they're

1249
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,960
sufficiently

1250
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
interesting to the groups can be made

1251
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,079
enforceable into laws

1252
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,920
and so that to me this is a very

1253
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
interesting way of a

1254
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,319
possibility of discovery of new laws

1255
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,240
and self-constraints that groups can put

1256
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
on themselves in order to function as

1257
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,800
larger systems in the globe kind of

1258
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,520
context

1259
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
but i'll put that aside for now but i

1260
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
just wanted to raise that is is this a

1261
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,560
discovery is this a mechanism for

1262
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,520
discovery

1263
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,599
of new working models of larger scale

1264
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,079
norms yes stephen

1265
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,000
yeah i think that that this is a good

1266
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,839
point because

1267
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,079
and and discovering that with this model

1268
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,119
here where you've got this

1269
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,359
task specific and then you've got this

1270
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,480
effective

1271
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,599
actually as a largest sort of scale

1272
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,400
time scale sort of checking i think it's

1273
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,960
also relevant in terms of how we can get

1274
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,920
mechanized in our like if we just keep

1275
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,520
doing the same task

1276
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,400
and we get the reward in the queue and

1277
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
it starts to

1278
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,359
create a high sense of this false sense

1279
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,560
of certainty

1280
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,440
in our world which is so much about just

1281
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,119
constructing more

1282
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,560
of our social niche and alienating or

1283
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,880
externalizing the environmental

1284
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,599
so we we can start to get caught up in

1285
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,920
this kind of task specific

1286
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,040
ways of working in silos and so there

1287
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,760
may be there's

1288
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
this this could speak to why we need to

1289
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,119
do some sort of sense breaking

1290
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,880
to sort of take us out of some of these

1291
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
mechanizations and

1292
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,240
look at a longer time scale

1293
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,839
and use affect to do that integration

1294
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,240
and not just rely on metrics

1295
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,880
cool let's let's take scott's point

1296
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,920
about this being

1297
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
not just an enforcement understanding

1298
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,839
but a discovery process

1299
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,920
and connect that to some topics we've

1300
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,839
been considering like bottom-up versus

1301
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,640
top-down

1302
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,920
function of systems so the bottom up is

1303
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,000
learning that's where the little ants

1304
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,359
are going out and they're finding

1305
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,480
different things or

1306
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,319
each of the cells in the retina is

1307
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,000
receiving a different photon or

1308
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,680
each person is receiving a different

1309
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,119
news feed and then

1310
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,319
as it goes quote up or in the system

1311
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,319
it's being aggregated and that is

1312
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,760
updating progressively

1313
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
more and more summary like variables

1314
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,440
like

1315
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,599
of teams or of organizations and then

1316
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,640
norms can feed back down to lower levels

1317
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,440
of the system

1318
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
whether in the brain like the bayesian

1319
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,560
brain or the predictive processing

1320
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,280
hypothesis or whether it's team

1321
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,160
communication

1322
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,800
norms and those can be informal or

1323
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,599
formal

1324
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,720
when we're talking about human

1325
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,440
organizations we gain this level of

1326
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,720
syntactic framing of top down priors

1327
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
so instead of just saying this is how

1328
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
things are like the red blood cells are

1329
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,839
flowing at this speed so that's the

1330
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,040
speed they're flowing at

1331
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,720
we're going to say there's a speed limit

1332
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,319
and if you don't follow the speed limit

1333
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,680
then we're going to have this type of

1334
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,359
enforcement mechanism

1335
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,160
and so it could be the case that at in

1336
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,800
the legal

1337
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,160
context that if you just apply a law

1338
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,640
a top down law it's kind of like trying

1339
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
to teach someone a motor pattern

1340
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
uh let's just say a speech law of some

1341
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,960
type of controlling speech

1342
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
it's like controlling someone's motor

1343
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,000
behavior again because it

1344
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,079
is a motor behavior and so what would

1345
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,119
you do would you put them in the

1346
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,160
exoskeleton

1347
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,800
and say okay here's a perfect golf swing

1348
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,760
now you're a golfer

1349
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,720
right well no you actually need to

1350
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,359
practice

1351
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,760
and you need to have feedback and so if

1352
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,400
the law

1353
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,720
is overly punitive and it says oh that

1354
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
one time that you got put in the

1355
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,839
exoskeleton you didn't understand how to

1356
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,319
golf

1357
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,640
and other sports that golfers know how

1358
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,160
could you not have made the connection

1359
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
there from that one time that i punished

1360
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
you for messing up

1361
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,920
that is not an extremely helpful

1362
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,319
framework for certain issues so how

1363
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,520
could we have this

1364
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,480
bi-directional conversation where

1365
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,839
there's experimentation

1366
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,200
and implementation at the edges and then

1367
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,680
people's experience percolates upwards

1368
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,880
in the system

1369
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,640
and then the system informally but

1370
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
eventually formally

1371
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,040
ends up entrenching healthy or

1372
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,839
productive

1373
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,200
or agreed upon patterns so

1374
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,119
it's an interesting thought about how

1375
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,720
these type of systems

1376
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
are not just about learning

1377
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,240
they're not just about exploitation as

1378
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,599
we've been thinking about they're sort

1379
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:19,920
of

1380
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,200
in both domains and they can trade off

1381
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,960
and when they need to exploit they can

1382
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,400
dip into exploitative

1383
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,200
uh type behavior but also they can be in

1384
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,400
an exploratory mode

1385
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,000
scott and it's also so much

1386
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,480
wrapped up in identity it's amazing how

1387
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
this is a new platform for identity

1388
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,240
because every thing has a markov blanket

1389
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,359
and it has attributes and

1390
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,839
external attributes that are presented

1391
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,400
and so

1392
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,079
the discovery when you have things like

1393
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,160
trade associations markets communities

1394
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,040
of interest

1395
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,240
where things entities

1396
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,280
with similar um

1397
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
i guess markov blankets and attributes

1398
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,880
can cluster together

1399
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
forming those systems which have larger

1400
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,400
scale which enable

1401
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,960
de-risking and leverage for the organism

1402
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,319
or organization at

1403
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,280
larger levels so the discovery process

1404
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,079
of bringing these

1405
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,680
markets are where markov blankets are

1406
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,119
um made similar

1407
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,720
right because you go in and there's a

1408
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,319
law it says if you're going it's your

1409
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,200
flea market

1410
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,680
your table can only be five by five so

1411
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,520
if you go in with a seven by five table

1412
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,040
you can't go to that flea market you

1413
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,640
have to follow the rules to be part of

1414
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,000
the club

1415
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,359
but if you're in the club you get the

1416
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,359
power of having more people walking past

1417
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:37,760
your

1418
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,920
table to sell stuff so there's the

1419
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,200
interface the law

1420
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,160
for the vendor to the flea market and

1421
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,040
then within

1422
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,319
that transaction there's a sub

1423
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,079
transaction which is if you want this

1424
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,280
little pocket knife

1425
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,720
you're going to give me three dollars

1426
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,000
and then i'll give you the pocket knife

1427
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
so these are the nesting of agreements

1428
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,040
in the context of identity and enforced

1429
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
and unenforced norms

1430
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,440
blue and then stephen

1431
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,319
so just to kind of tie into what both

1432
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,000
you and scott were saying so like

1433
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,079
you know for ants and we're going

1434
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,839
through the world like building

1435
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,520
this generative model like as we

1436
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,520
discover as we're learning right like so

1437
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,559
as we learn

1438
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,319
we build the generative model like to

1439
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,599
what extent is

1440
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,000
our generative model tied into our

1441
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,119
identity

1442
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,520
like that's um it's curious to think

1443
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,480
about and and

1444
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,079
i mean i know that like there's a policy

1445
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
update and perhaps the policy is more

1446
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,960
based on identity like we talked about

1447
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,960
earlier like the running every day

1448
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,880
uh maybe it's it's a policy thing that's

1449
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,280
identity and so the we pick the

1450
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,839
the policy that that then minimizes the

1451
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,520
free energy but but i just wonder like

1452
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,440
you know the the generative model

1453
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,720
how frequently that that he builds upon

1454
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
the identity like what the relationship

1455
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,079
is between those two

1456
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,359
okay and then stephen

1457
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,119
yeah well one thing that sort of ties

1458
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,960
into that question of identity

1459
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
and this this type of model is

1460
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,119
and the markov blanket i suppose is how

1461
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,040
much changes

1462
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,079
based on the diet

1463
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,119
that the processing which could be like

1464
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,160
this

1465
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,480
in the brain could be sort of structured

1466
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,280
through

1467
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,040
the way the brain is structured so there

1468
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,480
could be an additional type of

1469
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,920
structuring

1470
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
going on in which all of this is able to

1471
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,119
work together

1472
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,160
and then so how much is is this kind of

1473
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,400
the observations and the states in the

1474
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,839
sort of brain

1475
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,319
computating in relation and with the

1476
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,200
body

1477
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,280
and how much is it just literally the

1478
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,079
way the markov blanket itself

1479
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,359
is changed you know so and i think

1480
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,800
that's maybe an open question at the

1481
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,000
moment because

1482
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
there's the question i don't think as

1483
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,960
much as the idea of regimes of attention

1484
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
has been talked about but

1485
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,680
literally how would that change your

1486
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,920
computation by bringing in

1487
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,800
different parts of the body and the

1488
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
relation to the environment

1489
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,400
as the sort of marker blanket to

1490
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,680
integrate

1491
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,720
information coming in and how much is

1492
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,720
through computation and i sense that

1493
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,520
that at certain times maybe when you're

1494
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,800
learning something for the first time

1495
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,720
it's very computationally heavy but then

1496
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
as you draw things down and it becomes

1497
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,240
kind of tacit knowledge

1498
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,960
we might become subconsciously able to

1499
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,680
flow

1500
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,599
and shift yes formal systems

1501
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,000
can become integrated through muscle

1502
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,640
memory

1503
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,160
so somebody who's learning how to play

1504
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,640
violin they don't need to know the math

1505
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,720
of the frequency overlap they might

1506
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,319
learn that in their journey

1507
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,319
but also it becomes incorporated through

1508
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,160
culturally acquired practices

1509
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
and muscle memory and that could be

1510
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,440
carried out into other areas

1511
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,880
scott there was an article just read

1512
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,480
recently in nature or science which

1513
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,359
relates to

1514
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,119
the steven's last point and it was about

1515
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:55,680
how

1516
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,319
in in cultures where there were deaf

1517
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,400
cultures so they're isolated populations

1518
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
i think there was one in central america

1519
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,440
there was one in the middle east

1520
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,119
of deaf people because it was some kind

1521
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,800
of genetic thing and so large

1522
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
populations of isolated people who are

1523
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,920
deaf

1524
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,760
and what they found is when they came up

1525
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,440
with their independent sign languages

1526
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,760
they were all independently generated

1527
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,640
what they found in this research is they

1528
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
used the body

1529
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,200
in each of the isolated populations

1530
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,240
the body was used in the same

1531
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
way different parts like first thing

1532
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,520
i've i'm going to make up the

1533
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,040
parts because i can't remember them but

1534
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,880
they would first use the face parts then

1535
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,160
they would use the left arm then they

1536
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,359
would use the right arm then they would

1537
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,640
use the core of the body

1538
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,359
the morphology of speech through sign

1539
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,400
language

1540
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,559
was identical across the human

1541
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,000
populations even though they were

1542
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
isolated from each other

1543
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,119
in terms of what they added on i forget

1544
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,800
what it was with the bigger concepts or

1545
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,280
the

1546
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,880
the things that were emotional there

1547
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
were different morphologies

1548
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,119
of that i guess situating their

1549
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,640
expression

1550
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,440
in their morphology in other parts of

1551
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,480
their morphology so

1552
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,920
i thought it would relate to that i'm

1553
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,000
not sure how but it feels

1554
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,040
like that form of expression being

1555
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,520
uniform across humans it's like the um

1556
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,640
theories of

1557
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,480
humans having a language capacity i

1558
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,400
forget who's that is

1559
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,800
maybe mcluhan or somebody anyway but

1560
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,640
it's interesting that the morphology of

1561
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
the body

1562
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,200
that sounds like there's some intrinsic

1563
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,000
um

1564
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,119
uh tearing of what expression comes

1565
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,240
through what parts of the body

1566
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,640
i'll try to find very interesting and

1567
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,920
that actually reminds me

1568
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,040
of william blake's poetry and the

1569
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,400
four-fold albion

1570
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,240
which is a metaphor for cosmic persona

1571
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,640
as well as all of england as well as the

1572
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,760
individual body

1573
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,520
and so it's a metaphor that he returns

1574
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,960
to many times

1575
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,040
in an allegorical context and it's so

1576
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,079
evocative

1577
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,400
because it speaks to a multi-scale

1578
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,119
system

1579
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,160
and it is of course applying to

1580
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,079
multi multi-scale systems steven

1581
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,319
yeah thanks for that uh scott because i

1582
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,200
think that's

1583
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,359
i mean that could actually also you know

1584
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,040
there's all this thing about this innate

1585
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,800
language capacity which has now been

1586
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
kind of discounted but

1587
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,960
i mean if actions first and their

1588
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,319
morphology

1589
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,000
is maybe more related certainly within

1590
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,640
certain

1591
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,319
you know environmental niches that

1592
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,640
people have grown up in

1593
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,359
um that would maybe explain why there

1594
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,920
was that confusion in the language world

1595
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,680
because people sort of saw a language

1596
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,559
universe well actually if the

1597
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,920
morphologies

1598
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,160
where it's at and language is just an

1599
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,920
another type of morphology that's kind

1600
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,520
of building on the core morphology of

1601
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,480
the body

1602
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,240
that's where that patterning was coming

1603
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,319
from not the language itself

1604
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,000
or the languaging process look and

1605
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,359
i was just going to say extending that

1606
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,440
out further one of the assertions that

1607
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:51,760
i've

1608
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,800
started to make and and believe is that

1609
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,119
the mind doesn't reside in the brain at

1610
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
all the mind resides in language and in

1611
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,800
material culture and the brain is an

1612
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,839
antenna

1613
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,160
that we tune into the local mind

1614
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,960
wherever

1615
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,119
we're exposed to that's why colonialists

1616
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,240
put indigenous

1617
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,040
populations children in their schools

1618
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,240
right they take they want to

1619
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,319
tune their mind into a colonialist

1620
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,280
culture

1621
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,960
early because they then renders the

1622
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,400
externality innocuous for their

1623
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,599
colonialism

1624
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,880
anyway yes that's true of all children's

1625
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
education

1626
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,240
including contemporary and to bring in

1627
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,960
this key

1628
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,000
point of precision um again active

1629
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,079
inference is not about systems finding

1630
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,400
the most rewarding state and then

1631
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,440
sticking with it

1632
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,119
it's about precision so to connect that

1633
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,720
to identity

1634
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,760
um the child's education is being uh

1635
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,799
it's basically

1636
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,520
being given symbols that will help it

1637
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,920
navigate the regularities in its niche

1638
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,839
and again there can be dysfunctional

1639
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,839
education that leads to children that

1640
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:54,079
are

1641
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
incapable of taking advantage or of

1642
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,160
working with the regularities

1643
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,160
in the niche but this is where the

1644
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,920
policy selection piece comes into play

1645
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,359
to kind of return it to the figure

1646
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,720
because that's like important to return

1647
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,400
to what the paper said

1648
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,920
is the policy selection piece is so

1649
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,240
tied up with identity it's not that

1650
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,000
there's an identity like who we are and

1651
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,359
then there's this totally separate

1652
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,960
question of what we do

1653
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,079
it actually is we are how

1654
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,640
we act and to even take it to another

1655
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,520
level

1656
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,520
the understanding of how the world

1657
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,880
changes s

1658
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,640
the states that are external that we

1659
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,960
care about the understanding of how

1660
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
those states change is

1661
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
related to the policy actions that the

1662
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,079
system takes

1663
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,720
and so that even brings this relational

1664
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,200
mode

1665
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,599
another level deeper it's not just like

1666
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,559
say pure wharf

1667
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,319
oh well the words that you use change

1668
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,839
how you think or they influence how you

1669
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,480
think

1670
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,040
it's everything is influential on how we

1671
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,839
think because

1672
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,520
how we think is like this emergent

1673
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,680
outcome from all those factors

1674
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,760
so it's a starting point to say that the

1675
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,880
words that we have

1676
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,720
or the affordances or the sensory

1677
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,079
capacities that we have

1678
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,440
shape our understanding of the niche

1679
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,640
that's the starting point blue

1680
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,200
so just to piggyback on the idea of a

1681
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,839
team

1682
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,960
and identity like like how and also

1683
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,559
where the mind is like where is the mind

1684
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,680
of a team

1685
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,559
right like when you're when you're

1686
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,160
thinking about this in terms of active

1687
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,799
inference

1688
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,079
and so the the individual team members i

1689
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,079
mean we've all worked on teams before

1690
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,960
at various points and it's amazing how

1691
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,599
the team

1692
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,000
changes based on the like the function

1693
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
of its individual components right like

1694
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,680
so there are different people that bring

1695
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,200
different dynamics to a team

1696
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,599
some people may be louder stronger or

1697
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,640
less influential

1698
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,480
or or everyone has a different kind of

1699
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,160
role in a team

1700
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,319
and and these all like really bring

1701
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,000
changes to the overall structure and the

1702
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,440
way that the team will

1703
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,599
react right like like based on a query

1704
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,880
like when you query a team

1705
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,240
you know what is the best project of the

1706
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,000
year that'll change based on

1707
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,760
the the individual components of that

1708
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,119
team

1709
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,160
yep and the team organism mapping

1710
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,640
let's think about team onboarding and

1711
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,240
the way that the interface of the

1712
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,280
organism

1713
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,359
is like an interface of a team so the

1714
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,119
immune system of a person

1715
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,799
there's times where something is

1716
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,040
onboarded but in a very controlled way

1717
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,000
and it does not trigger

1718
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,319
the immune system so for example if you

1719
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,440
eat something

1720
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,200
in the stomach which is a specialized

1721
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,960
chamber that digests food

1722
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,559
it is then absorbed through the

1723
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,400
interface of the gut

1724
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
in a controllable way in a way where

1725
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,079
only the safe pieces like you know that

1726
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,520
the sugars are coming in and the amino

1727
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,599
acids are coming in lipids are coming in

1728
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,200
so through that controlled and

1729
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,839
evolutionarily selected upon interface

1730
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,520
there is an onboarding process that's

1731
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,200
healthy but if there's a

1732
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,000
onboarding event on your body like a cut

1733
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,200
in your skin

1734
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,960
it's going to trigger the immune system

1735
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
so that's more like a security breach

1736
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,760
for a team

1737
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,160
whereas eating for a team might be like

1738
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,359
hey we're going to get this

1739
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,200
ingest of new data our colleague is

1740
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,799
going to send us a data set

1741
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,160
it's going to come from this email

1742
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,839
address and it's this type

1743
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,200
if it's from a different email address

1744
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,480
i'm not going to see it or if it's of a

1745
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,520
different type we're going to need to

1746
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,040
change our pipeline

1747
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,520
but if it's this type of food coming at

1748
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,720
this interface and it's

1749
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,880
you know this structure we're going to

1750
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
be able to digest that

1751
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,240
and then use the information latent in

1752
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,119
that

1753
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,240
input to help our team become more

1754
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,960
structured

1755
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
or to expand just like an organism would

1756
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,319
break down the food and

1757
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,480
use it to grow itself or to operate

1758
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,880
stephen

1759
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,000
and also with teams you've got the the

1760
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,880
teleology

1761
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,520
of the team like the purpose the goals

1762
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,400
and

1763
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,319
i think that that i mean this figure's

1764
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,559
sort of speaking lots of task based

1765
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,400
you know ways of things being evaluated

1766
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,520
with rewards

1767
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,079
and the way that we structure our teams

1768
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,359
often with

1769
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,880
the way that we then construct the

1770
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,280
environment to sort of

1771
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,920
lead us towards those rewards in a way

1772
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
and i'm really interested in looking at

1773
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,599
this thing called infusion space that

1774
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,880
i've been working on is

1775
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,079
when we are in a kind of an organized

1776
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,680
space with a teleology and a direction

1777
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,920
like a team an organization and then

1778
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,240
when we're in a sort of community

1779
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,079
uh space where which maybe this isn't

1780
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,160
i think is another process of affect

1781
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,400
where we're sort of attuning

1782
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,839
to um that kind of inter-subjective

1783
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:20,720
dynamic

1784
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,680
between us and you know there's there's

1785
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,599
one's more efficient the team's more

1786
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,440
efficient if your goal is the right goal

1787
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,960
the danger is that you could be

1788
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,400
they talk about now with the modern

1789
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,000
world as we're getting very good at

1790
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,680
doing the wrong things

1791
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,000
so it can be the trap you fall into so

1792
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,440
climate change being a classic case

1793
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,160
we're very good

1794
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,440
doing things we shouldn't be doing so i

1795
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,960
think there's an interesting

1796
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,440
question there about a teleological

1797
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,400
dynamic

1798
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,640
aligned to goals and rewards which

1799
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,520
everything's then

1800
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,640
and it could actually remove the knowing

1801
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,160
of your affect

1802
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,839
and you can just ignore it because

1803
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,359
you're getting other kicks

1804
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,400
and when the deeper knowing is like you

1805
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
know it's not really going to be good

1806
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,240
when you talk about really long time

1807
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,000
scales

1808
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,359
okay let's expand on that so teleology

1809
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,119
is coming from the word teleos which is

1810
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,680
the end so teleology is the study

1811
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,640
in philosophy of what systems are as

1812
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,559
defined by their ends so the purpose of

1813
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,280
something like

1814
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,319
houses are to keep people warm and what

1815
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,520
are people for

1816
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,040
but instead of engaging in the

1817
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,440
philosophy of teleology like what does

1818
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,040
it mean to be a human what are we here

1819
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,599
for

1820
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,440
we can think about it from a cybernetics

1821
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,880
perspective which is

1822
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
also equivalent to like an intentional

1823
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,400
stance in philosophy

1824
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,000
and that's kind of like saying like okay

1825
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,599
look whether or not we're ever going to

1826
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:40,880
figure out the ultimate

1827
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,359
teleos of a human or the ultimate teleos

1828
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,480
of our team

1829
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,119
at the very least as a goal seeking

1830
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,119
system that has to operate amidst

1831
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,079
uncertainty

1832
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,480
and communicate through limited and

1833
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,920
noisy channels

1834
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
we need to have clarity on our mission

1835
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,160
our local telios

1836
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,240
so that we can have clarity on action

1837
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
and again if your local mission

1838
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,359
is something that is uh pursuable

1839
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,440
then it's it's a second layer whether

1840
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,359
it's quote good or bad

1841
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,839
and that's the whole question about what

1842
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:12,480
scott

1843
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,119
raised with the markov blankets of legal

1844
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:15,680
entities

1845
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,760
and there it's kind of easy to see some

1846
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,280
of the analogies between let's say a

1847
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,720
society and a person

1848
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,040
if each cell were to fight for its

1849
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,240
markov blanket

1850
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,720
then things could get hairy pretty fast

1851
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,720
whereas over evolutionary time

1852
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,640
the interfaces between cells of the

1853
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,440
organism have evolved through so many

1854
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,960
different proteins and so many different

1855
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,119
mechanisms to work well

1856
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,200
together to be compatible within the

1857
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,119
organism and similarly

1858
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,839
within a healthy operating system for

1859
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,960
legal entities

1860
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,240
you could imagine there would be healthy

1861
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,400
interfaces but in the absence of a

1862
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,680
healthy interface

1863
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,240
then even entities whose interests are

1864
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,599
completely aligned

1865
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,000
might end up in extremely adversarial

1866
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,039
context together

1867
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,720
scott and i think that might be the

1868
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,920
problem with kant's emanuel kant's

1869
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,760
uh what is it called the something

1870
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,039
imperative

1871
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,079
category yes and is that the notion that

1872
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:10,559
if the

1873
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,640
a human acts a good human acts in a good

1874
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,920
way it'll be good for

1875
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,960
society so uh

1876
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,640
the kantian imperative as it's uh called

1877
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,640
a categorical imperative sometimes uh

1878
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,559
it's uh i'm just i just wanted to look

1879
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,920
up an exact word

1880
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,240
it is quoted as a rule of conduct that

1881
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,480
is unconditional or absolute for all

1882
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,160
agents the validity of claim

1883
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,000
of which does not depend on any desire

1884
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,359
or end

1885
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,319
that and yeah that reads heavily as that

1886
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,480
classic era of abstraction

1887
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,720
in philosophy and that's one of the

1888
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,880
problems in european law right now in an

1889
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,039
identity law like gdpr and those kind of

1890
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,799
things in the real world

1891
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,160
their idea of entities and of identity

1892
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,319
is based on hegel and kant

1893
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,559
and those are there there is a real

1894
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,240
focus on that individual

1895
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,720
being good and that being enough to have

1896
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,280
the entire society work well

1897
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,039
and i think that's part of the prob

1898
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,559
challenges over there

1899
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,559
they then continental law you make the

1900
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,920
law

1901
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,160
and you refer back to the statute all

1902
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,039
the time

1903
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,119
in common law which is any place that

1904
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,240
was part of the

1905
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
british empire you what you do is you

1906
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,280
come up with a

1907
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,119
half-assed version of the law and then

1908
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,680
you allow common law to fix it up

1909
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,839
so the common law acts as a continually

1910
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:28,880
dynamic

1911
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,319
revisiting um because the courts then

1912
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,000
make the law and then when you when you

1913
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,839
have a later case you don't just look at

1914
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,200
the original statute you look at the

1915
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,079
cases as

1916
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,319
well the other court cases and so it's

1917
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,079
been modified by that so one of the

1918
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,000
things that this gets tangled up in

1919
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,559
is philosophically a question of how

1920
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,240
much of a teleology you have

1921
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,760
i believe my personal belief is that

1922
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,359
because they had royalty a tradition of

1923
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,599
royalty on the european continent

1924
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,280
that they're more amenable to a single

1925
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,920
voice and so that single voice can act

1926
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,680
in a misdirected way for a longer period

1927
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,559
of time

1928
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,200
because it projects onto a paradigm onto

1929
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,319
the population

1930
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,559
but it's just something that it gets

1931
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,559
softer at that level perhaps

1932
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,160
because we don't know the data and the

1933
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,480
metrics but it feels like those same

1934
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,599
kind of

1935
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,440
things are iterating from a system

1936
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,359
perspective if you have something that's

1937
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,799
too stuck in the mud

1938
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,799
it's not going to change as fast and now

1939
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,160
that's happening everywhere since

1940
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,599
technology

1941
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,599
moore's law increases interactions

1942
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,880
exponentially

1943
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,000
all of our institutions all of them were

1944
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,480
intended to de-risk and leverage much

1945
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,520
more leisurely

1946
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,599
institutional contexts so they're no

1947
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,200
longer fit for function in the

1948
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,680
interaction landscapes we have

1949
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,599
and so one of the questions is does how

1950
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
in what way might this analysis

1951
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,400
help us to not just improve all the

1952
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,160
institutions that might not be possible

1953
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,400
but construct institutions that can

1954
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,200
better

1955
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,799
be dynamic with the increased frequency

1956
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,160
and volume

1957
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,680
of interactions we have which is

1958
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,359
perceived by any one

1959
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,079
institution as an increase in density

1960
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,200
interaction density

1961
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,880
that's why your calendar is all jammed

1962
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,640
up because we're still using calendars

1963
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,160
the way we used to use them which is

1964
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,079
linear progression of things they have

1965
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,359
to do things like that so

1966
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,960
anyway sorry about the question there

1967
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,680
yeah interesting stephen

1968
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,520
well that might now that also might tie

1969
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,359
into this idea of when

1970
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,319
we have systems in our niche that we've

1971
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,359
created when

1972
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,280
you know when do we need them to be more

1973
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,400
attunable to

1974
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,720
our own active inference types of

1975
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,799
dynamics like if we if this is the type

1976
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:31,760
of way that we

1977
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,039
can you know what would help us be

1978
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,760
better at attuning and what types of

1979
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,480
attention

1980
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,799
at what types of scale would we want

1981
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,640
this kind of dynamical

1982
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,240
process and when does it want to be

1983
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,920
fixed and it kind of speaks another

1984
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,559
problem

1985
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,559
in the development world was the right

1986
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:49,599
based approach

1987
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,599
to development so someone somewhere

1988
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,119
defines what

1989
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,760
people's rights are and what's the and

1990
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,839
then it gets dictated down but that

1991
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,280
causes a lot of problems when you roll

1992
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,599
out into cultures which

1993
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,240
value things slightly different to those

1994
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
that decided what's right and it's also

1995
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,839
what's right for someone

1996
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,480
in a poor context or a poverty context

1997
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,640
might not be quite it is with someone in

1998
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,119
a

1999
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,520
in a developed wealthy context so the

2000
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,400
same

2001
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,240
you know maybe this is a question that

2002
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,079
needs to be asked is when do we need to

2003
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,119
have

2004
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,760
this kind of active inference ergodic

2005
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,640
help

2006
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,280
you know thought about crit and when do

2007
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,880
we say look this isn't being done that

2008
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,559
way we're just going to bolt it down and

2009
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,240
use a non-ergodic

2010
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,839
kind of structured state of this sort of

2011
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,880
laws okay interesting

2012
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,760
so let's try to connect that to uh cont

2013
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,039
and then back to action

2014
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,960
because that's the key piece and that's

2015
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,319
what we really want to emphasize with

2016
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,520
the active inference

2017
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,079
approach is that although we generalize

2018
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,839
we're generalizing to reduce our

2019
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,039
uncertainty about

2020
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,119
observations which could be letters or

2021
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,079
sounds that we're hearing

2022
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,839
we're reducing our uncertainty about the

2023
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,640
stimuli that we're as people receiving

2024
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,559
by generalizing so that we can guide

2025
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,039
action and so the categorical imperative

2026
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,520
on wikipedia it says it's best known

2027
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,119
from its first formulation

2028
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,520
act only according to that maxim whereby

2029
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,119
you can at the same time

2030
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,960
will that it should become a universal

2031
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,799
law so that's actually also

2032
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,559
related in a sense like a symmetry

2033
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,880
relationship with the rawlsian theories

2034
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,839
of justice

2035
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,079
like what would be fair would be if you

2036
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,680
were to be a random draw

2037
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
you'd want to be in that society versus

2038
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,960
another society

2039
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,480
but here's where active inference and

2040
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,240
action and the reality of the finite

2041
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,599
world come into play

2042
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,359
different people have different risk

2043
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,280
preference trade-offs so maybe somebody

2044
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,160
says yeah

2045
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,760
i'll take a one in a million chance of

2046
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,200
being the dictator and somebody else

2047
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,000
says no i'd rather

2048
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,880
have a 100 chance of being in this other

2049
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,480
world where everyone has the exact same

2050
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,880
amount of official power for example

2051
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,039
but even at a deeper level that's a

2052
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,400
thought discussion

2053
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,039
and it's becoming increasingly lifted

2054
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,280
from action and from policy selections

2055
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,000
that we

2056
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,559
as the agents perceiving that question

2057
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,000
are being faced with

2058
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,599
and so when people bring in the things

2059
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,760
like it should become a universal law

2060
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,520
that's a normative claim about a

2061
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,119
universalism about a law

2062
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,400
you know and who's the judge jury

2063
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,640
executioner so although the sentence

2064
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,319
the imperative started with act

2065
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,158
according to

2066
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,719
it ended up in the clouds with some

2067
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:19,600
speculation

2068
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,600
about what could or would or should

2069
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,040
become universal

2070
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,279
and ostensibly enforced by other people

2071
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,120
with weapons but not yourself

2072
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,279
so how do we tie it back to the real

2073
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,319
system

2074
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,319
and confront ourselves with what we

2075
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,399
actually are being faced with

2076
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,399
from an affordance and from a challenges

2077
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,000
perspective and then

2078
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,040
ask what policies will help guide the

2079
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,158
whole system

2080
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:44,719
towards states that we want to see but

2081
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,640
at first we can just acquire precision

2082
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,120
about

2083
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,279
who are we what are our relationships

2084
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,120
what are our interfaces

2085
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,439
how can we think in a more rigorous

2086
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,040
multi-scale way

2087
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,600
about how we are composed of our

2088
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,560
relationships

2089
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,640
so not that i'm some atom and i'm being

2090
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,560
influenced by my relationships but

2091
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,479
it's multi-scale relationships all the

2092
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,399
way up and down so

2093
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,719
what is really happening here these are

2094
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,359
some interesting ways that sidestep

2095
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,319
morality when working together but they

2096
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:14,960
sidestep

2097
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,279
the ways that morality has been framed

2098
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,560
in terms of well i think it should

2099
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,000
become a universal law that

2100
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,839
i should get all the money and then it's

2101
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:22,960
easy for me to act within the

2102
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,560
categorical imperative under that

2103
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,439
understanding

2104
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,880
when someone says well no that's not the

2105
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,238
real understanding and then you're right

2106
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,439
back to square zero

2107
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,839
so how are we going to use systems

2108
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:32,640
thinking

2109
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,560
but also include aspects of

2110
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,960
intercultural communication and

2111
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,319
understanding that people are going to

2112
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,759
be having different experiences of the

2113
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:40,479
same deal

2114
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,158
the same interface different people are

2115
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:43,279
going to have different experiences of

2116
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:43,839
it

2117
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,399
and then work within that environment so

2118
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,439
that's kind of

2119
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,000
you know some big areas that hopefully

2120
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,679
we'll be thinking about

2121
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,080
in the coming years because they're uh

2122
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,920
serious questions about how to interface

2123
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,600
formal systems with people scott

2124
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,280
one of the things that's interesting

2125
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,120
right now in law is that you know it's

2126
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:03,840
really showing

2127
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
wear and tear and people are really

2128
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,520
focusing on liability

2129
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,040
and rights and things like that which is

2130
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,360
terrific but one of the things the right

2131
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,560
is an is an expectation and

2132
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,480
what the law does is it constructs a

2133
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,640
bunch of duties around that right that

2134
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,199
give

2135
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,840
life to the right so if i say have a

2136
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,440
right to free speech and nobody has a

2137
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,040
duty to respect it then i don't have

2138
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,679
anything except words on paper

2139
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,520
and so the duties the construction of

2140
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,280
duties what that does

2141
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,480
is its constraint on other uh expression

2142
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,159
other markov blankets right you're

2143
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,840
limiting and constraining

2144
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,320
the environment of other individuals

2145
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,080
you'll meet because they have a duty to

2146
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:42,400
do

2147
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,280
x the duty to there's a judge who said

2148
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,600
years ago in the united states

2149
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,760
your right to swing your head arm in

2150
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,760
public ends where my nose begins

2151
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,840
right so you can keep doing this until

2152
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,280
my nose is next to where you're swinging

2153
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,320
your arm

2154
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,480
so it's interesting isn't it that you

2155
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,719
have this that is really that dynamic

2156
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:03,440
element if

2157
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,440
a nose is introduced into that system

2158
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,280
you got to stop swinging your arm

2159
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,760
right and so the anticipation of

2160
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,199
situations where you shouldn't swing

2161
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,640
your arm don't swing your arm in an

2162
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,920
elevator

2163
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,199
you know that kind of thing right don't

2164
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,280
don't spit on the subway right you start

2165
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,560
to have these rules which are like hey

2166
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,239
we can generalize that

2167
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,120
duty to a population and if it's

2168
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,800
relatively innocuous

2169
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,000
like red means stop

2170
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,480
purple could mean stop it's not the

2171
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,920
light that stops the car it's the

2172
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,800
behavior

2173
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,520
elicited by the signal so there are a

2174
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,280
lot of innocuous things we can

2175
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,760
avoid avoidable harms by agreeing on

2176
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,920
innocuous signaling for certain duties

2177
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,040
and behaviors

2178
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,440
that would render those rights to be

2179
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,880
realized and to be

2180
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,640
living yep so with this kind of eating

2181
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,159
team metaphor ingestion of stimuli

2182
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,000
or a food at the organism level and

2183
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,280
that's being processed

2184
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,199
either chemically with food or

2185
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,440
informationally with the stimuli

2186
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,440
in order to guide action so we can think

2187
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,679
about these teams and organizations

2188
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,239
as getting inputs and then engaging in

2189
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,679
action in their niche

2190
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,760
and the goal of the inputs and selection

2191
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,120
is going to shape this

2192
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,440
is so that the inputs can be processed

2193
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,159
in a way

2194
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,800
that leads to outputs that are effective

2195
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,280
and so

2196
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,320
again another mapping would be to a heat

2197
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,040
system so like an engine if you can

2198
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,679
convert 100 of the potential energy

2199
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,239
into work it's a very efficient system

2200
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,239
and it doesn't lose a lot to heat

2201
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,000
whereas if you have a system that's

2202
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,080
broken or has inefficiencies in it

2203
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,159
it will perform very little work in its

2204
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,760
task specific

2205
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,480
uh role and it will release a lot as

2206
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,320
heat which is like wasted energy that's

2207
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,040
like data

2208
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,280
exhaust there's wasted data there's so

2209
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,800
many mappings here

2210
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,239
actually in the last couple minutes

2211
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,000
let's just run through the slides see if

2212
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,679
anything comes to mind but

2213
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,199
other than that i'm sure we could keep

2214
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,360
on you know thinking about this

2215
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,159
figure two of the paper the authors

2216
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,960
showed this

2217
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,560
rollout game and uh the agent at each

2218
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,520
time point

2219
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,320
is imagining what could happen on future

2220
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,280
timelines

2221
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,120
and so here's a timeline where i stay in

2222
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,719
this neutral state on the left side

2223
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,080
here's a timeline where

2224
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,920
i get to state three and that's good

2225
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,159
then i go to state four and it's bat and

2226
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:18,480
so

2227
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,440
as you simulate and you roll out more

2228
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,640
and more and more

2229
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,719
deeply that's the sophisticated or the

2230
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,320
deep component

2231
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,080
as you roll that out in order to track

2232
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,239
what uh kind of a world you're in are

2233
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,920
you in a world where all the routes are

2234
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,440
bad or all of them are good or some are

2235
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,719
goods or bad

2236
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,440
the agent is tracking a few things it's

2237
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,960
tracking the state estimates like the

2238
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,480
expected value

2239
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,800
of different policy choices but also the

2240
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,560
variance or the uncertainty

2241
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,120
and what we saw in this paper was that

2242
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,440
as the agent starts initially thinking

2243
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,400
and simulating deeply it starts to be

2244
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,440
perceiving itself

2245
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,080
in states that are rewarding and it has

2246
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,920
relatively high precision about being

2247
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,159
able to maintain itself in those states

2248
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,400
but as it continues to simulate deeper

2249
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,520
and deeper

2250
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,080
the precision of its model drops this is

2251
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,960
associated with

2252
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,040
anxiety from the computational

2253
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,960
psychiatry perspective

2254
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,840
and uh it's also associated with the

2255
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,440
increased percentage

2256
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,600
of the events being negative but not a

2257
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,280
10x increase in the events being

2258
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,360
negative and as we pointed out last time

2259
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,040
it's actually when the threat perception

2260
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,719
is at a medium level

2261
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,360
when the anxiety skyrockets and again

2262
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,239
this specific

2263
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,320
trace is just related to the parameters

2264
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,000
of this model so it's not meant to be a

2265
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,840
general claim about anxiety or something

2266
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,640
like that

2267
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,800
it is for future work to really map this

2268
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,159
onto real world

2269
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,120
systems we had the formalisms which

2270
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,679
people can

2271
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,640
pause and look at

2272
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,560
the formalisms of sophisticated

2273
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,840
inference

2274
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,880
and the real

2275
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,199
natural language translations of some of

2276
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,719
these variables that are interacting

2277
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,760
in these papers we talked about the

2278
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,719
generalized

2279
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,360
free energy and about how that formalism

2280
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,440
has a few different parts

2281
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,679
one of those parts is conditioned on

2282
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,640
policies

2283
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,640
and it talks about the relational

2284
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,520
mapping between observations and states

2285
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,920
and then the other function here is

2286
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,640
conditioned

2287
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,640
on policy and it's uh yeah

2288
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,719
sorry let me just rephrase that one of

2289
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,960
these sides is conditioned on policy

2290
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,040
and relates to states the other side is

2291
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,800
conditioned on observations and states

2292
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,040
and it relates to policy selection

2293
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,679
um we talked about a few other topics

2294
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,440
intrinsic and external value

2295
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,800
general and special cases and how

2296
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,159
when you are moving through a prediction

2297
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,760
in this branching way there's an

2298
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,199
exponentially increasing

2299
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,840
number of states and so in order to deal

2300
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,960
with that

2301
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,960
organisms or systems have to engage in a

2302
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,000
little bit more of a guided

2303
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,239
kind of search and that brings us to

2304
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,679
this slide which is what i kind of

2305
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,679
wanted to pause on because i think blue

2306
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,719
this is what

2307
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,239
made you say we have to invite scott

2308
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,719
so what what was interesting to you here

2309
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,040
what made you think of that

2310
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,880
just uh scott and how um scott's always

2311
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,440
presenting on risk and this just was

2312
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,159
like well

2313
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,760
i think that scott really needs to be

2314
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,520
here and based on also the fact that

2315
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,000
scott

2316
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,239
um said he'd been studying active

2317
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,440
inference since

2318
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,159
the october complexity weekend so those

2319
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,840
two things kind of

2320
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,520
nailed it for me cool i feel like it's a

2321
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,560
it's this giant thing a smorgasbord

2322
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,640
that's in the next room that i haven't

2323
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:34,960
yet

2324
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,719
entered into that's it's it's so

2325
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,080
delightful i'm so

2326
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,320
thrilled by my ignorance in this this is

2327
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,840
the best

2328
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,000
gift i could ever get so thank you all

2329
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,960
you know

2330
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,440
it's like a room to room party you just

2331
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,199
go room to room and it's always a new

2332
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:49,679
setting

2333
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,080
but we're bringing the party along

2334
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,800
because it's

2335
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,600
enacted it's not that there's a room of

2336
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,120
researchers or a community that's

2337
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,000
waiting

2338
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,080
for us to be onboarded onto we're

2339
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,120
co-domesticating each other

2340
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,199
and creating the community that we want

2341
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,120
to see so that's self-organization and

2342
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,719
multi-scale organization

2343
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,120
in action and we can think about that

2344
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,000
actually

2345
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,239
tying it back to this figure so the

2346
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,199
active inference

2347
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,920
framework under special cases which were

2348
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,440
described in this

2349
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,719
slide we can think about

2350
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,800
a few different cases where certain

2351
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,960
things are driven to zero

2352
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,080
so when there's no uncertainty

2353
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,560
about states in other words states of

2354
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,400
the world can be perfectly known

2355
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,480
then risk-sensitive policies can be

2356
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,920
enacted

2357
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,199
so um when there's no ambiguity about

2358
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:41,760
states

2359
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,239
you can talk about risk that's this part

2360
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,120
right here

2361
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,840
however when there is ambiguity about

2362
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,640
states

2363
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,960
you have to reduce that uncertainty and

2364
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,080
that's sort of like

2365
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
if you don't know what the states of the

2366
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,520
system are

2367
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,560
you can't operate but to the extent you

2368
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,800
have reduced ambiguity about the

2369
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,120
observations in states you're able to

2370
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,400
increasingly plan

2371
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,040
risk sensitive policy so scott that

2372
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,159
makes me think about

2373
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,400
in a world of digital transactions where

2374
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,000
we can have reduced uncertainty

2375
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,320
about certain types of events happening

2376
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,600
could we then

2377
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
move some of that energy and focus to

2378
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,280
risk-aware

2379
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,080
policy so that's one piece here that's

2380
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,920
why i call what we have right now a

2381
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,320
self-boiling ocean

2382
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,440
nice so that's the that's the saddle

2383
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,920
meme this is still within the context of

2384
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,920
how most people think about ambiguity

2385
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,880
and uncertainty

2386
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,480
vuca that's in the terms of minimization

2387
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,679
of two different things

2388
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,480
minimize uncertainty minimize risk first

2389
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,400
go ahead and reduce your uncertainty

2390
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,520
about the states

2391
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,800
and then to whatever extent you can do

2392
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,560
that reduce our uncertainty about the

2393
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,560
future vis-a-vis reducing risk

2394
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,199
that's the normal framework for most

2395
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:53,679
people

2396
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,440
or at least it's one way to think about

2397
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,800
it but now

2398
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,880
let's think about it um active inference

2399
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,080
not just in a risk

2400
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,080
controlled way but in this bayesian

2401
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,520
statistical framework

2402
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,520
a variational framework where we're

2403
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,800
actually doing

2404
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,280
not just a double minimization but we're

2405
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,159
doing like a push

2406
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,239
pull with a minimization and an

2407
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,320
exploration simultaneously

2408
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,840
so we're going to be able to dynamically

2409
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,560
adjust explore exploit it's not exactly

2410
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,320
explore exploit as we talked about but

2411
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,400
it's like explore exploit because we can

2412
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,560
dynamically adjust the relative pressure

2413
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,440
or weighting

2414
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,600
of the in and the out so we're always

2415
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,480
exploring

2416
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,320
and we're also always reducing our

2417
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,920
uncertainty

2418
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,400
about the system and so that's why the

2419
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:34,960
uh

2420
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,960
two arrows are moved into an overlapping

2421
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,760
uh area just graphically this is just a

2422
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,360
loose graphical model here

2423
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,840
because not it's not a disjoint two-step

2424
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,640
process

2425
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,880
ambiguity about states and then

2426
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,000
ambiguity about risk

2427
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,400
if we have certainty about states this

2428
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,760
is the co

2429
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,120
joint estimation of all these pieces

2430
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,880
together in a way that's a push-pull

2431
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,199
so there's a couple paradigm-changing

2432
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,320
ways of framing

2433
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,520
risk and operating in this mode

2434
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,000
and that will lead to different types of

2435
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,679
institutional structures that will be

2436
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,760
distributed which will resemble

2437
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,800
neighborhood watch

2438
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,239
but it won't just be neighborhood watch

2439
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,639
it'll be neighborhood creation as well

2440
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,719
that's a fundamental change exactly

2441
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,239
instead of just putting up the law at

2442
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,719
like a trip wire and then triggering it

2443
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,800
yeah you could say how do we just have

2444
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,480
people who are going on a neighborhood

2445
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:26,960
walk

2446
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,639
just people walking the neighborhood

2447
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,639
it's like you know like they could

2448
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,560
just having fun and being social could

2449
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,000
that be the actual

2450
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,679
thing and so it fuses several of the

2451
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,520
previous ways of thinking about it well

2452
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,800
we're going to reduce our uncertainty

2453
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,600
about what's happening in the

2454
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,320
neighborhood

2455
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,600
and then we're going to do a risk

2456
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,760
minimization policy well this makes you

2457
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,000
think

2458
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,840
about installing surveillance cameras

2459
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,199
but what if you said we're going to

2460
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,719
jointly be discovering

2461
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,880
what community norms we have and what we

2462
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,320
want to be aspirationally as a

2463
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,280
neighborhood

2464
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,320
around safety or around communication

2465
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,239
and maybe there's a way where we can

2466
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,159
just go on walks in the afternoon

2467
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,199
and all of a sudden people are

2468
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,520
connecting and it's a safer world

2469
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,520
and the other just one other thing i

2470
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,360
once read an article about the world

2471
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,000
champion

2472
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,199
fly tie tire and he tied flies and they

2473
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,199
were the best most successful flies for

2474
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,480
catching fish

2475
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,239
but all the people complained that his

2476
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,400
flies didn't look like

2477
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,239
actual insects they didn't fool humans

2478
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,360
and he said i don't have to fool the

2479
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,920
humans i just had to fool the fish

2480
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,159
and so the reason i say that here is the

2481
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,440
way we're going to do this is we're

2482
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,880
going to use the left side we're going

2483
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,639
to get people in by saying hey you got

2484
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,199
risk

2485
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,480
what have you been doing about the risk

2486
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,159
let's talk about the risk okay that's

2487
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:36,719
fine

2488
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:37,840
we're going to get other people in the

2489
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,520
room who are going to be talking about

2490
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,480
the same risk but they

2491
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,480
people never met each other before and

2492
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,679
then by the time they leave the room

2493
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:44,639
they're going to be in the right-hand

2494
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:45,679
side of the design

2495
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,040
that's where the governance is going to

2496
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,639
shift we're going to hook them with

2497
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:49,520
something they re

2498
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,159
they recognize like the fish guy we're

2499
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,360
going to hook them with the thing on the

2500
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,880
left which is hey risk we're going to

2501
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,080
talk about risk that's what the atlas

2502
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,840
of risk i'll send it around to the other

2503
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,360
folks but some of you have it

2504
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,920
it's 870 different information risks

2505
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,159
that are shared by people now because

2506
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,320
digital stuff has made everybody have

2507
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,000
trouble so they

2508
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,480
come for the risks they know but by the

2509
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,000
time they leave they're going to be

2510
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
organized into different groups that

2511
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,520
aren't going to be dealing with the risk

2512
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,480
the risk was

2513
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,120
the existing risk description was just a

2514
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,360
way to get them in the room

2515
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,199
yes yes so one metaphor before stephen

2516
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,719
instead of let's let's measure your

2517
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,080
blood measure your blood measure your

2518
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,679
blood so that we can measure your risk

2519
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,719
of the disease

2520
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,719
this is like how could we be doing

2521
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,080
active inference

2522
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,800
on health and working towards health in

2523
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,000
a way that yeah maybe we'll do a

2524
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,360
measurement here or there

2525
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,040
and we do want to reduce risk and we

2526
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,560
will reduce risk

2527
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,480
but we're actually framing it in a way

2528
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,840
that's like a journey

2529
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,719
related to health in mind rather than

2530
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:49,679
ambiguity

2531
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,239
risk disease negative negative negative

2532
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:52,960
uncertainty

2533
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,080
anxiety how about yin and yang

2534
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,440
with a little bit of a more balanced

2535
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,199
understanding about how we can function

2536
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,239
and enact policy stephen

2537
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,920
this is a very important diagram

2538
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,360
actually

2539
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,120
like you're saying this this takes us

2540
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,360
away from just trying to reduce

2541
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,159
uncertainty about the external stimuli

2542
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,280
and the kind of

2543
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,639
locked in risk aversion and you're

2544
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,239
actually working more with that

2545
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,920
time dependent or time series

2546
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,480
um approach that active inference gives

2547
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,400
of like well how are things changing and

2548
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,040
how

2549
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,360
just like that fish looking at the the

2550
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,239
fly

2551
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:34,159
how does that embodied agent

2552
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,239
and the wisdom and recognizing that

2553
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,440
there's a wisdom

2554
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,360
about how to be in the world and how to

2555
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,480
be with your niche

2556
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,520
how is that actually being used

2557
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,800
to inform how we make things happen and

2558
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,440
not just this more mechanical

2559
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,280
approach yes and

2560
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,320
good points there um in

2561
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,520
active inference stream 19 yonder

2562
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,719
in mid april we're going to have deeply

2563
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:03,840
felt affect

2564
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,040
which is one of the papers that was

2565
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,639
cited in this paper but we're going to

2566
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,400
go into it in more detail

2567
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,080
we'll talk about perception about

2568
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,520
anticipation

2569
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,840
action metacognition implicit

2570
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,400
metacognition

2571
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,679
and just to close out i listed a few

2572
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,480
questions um do people want to hang out

2573
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,440
for a few more

2574
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,840
minutes and talk for a little bit yeah

2575
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:26,880
it sounds good but

2576
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,400
i'll just give the closing slider then

2577
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,840
we'll return to the question slide

2578
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,040
thanks everyone for

2579
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,239
participating the live viewers

2580
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,960
uh have a link to a feedback form in the

2581
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,760
event

2582
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,920
everyone else really thanks so much for

2583
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,360
2020

2584
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,679
super special and unique experience for

2585
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:44,400
all of us

2586
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,400
so really deeply appreciated for those

2587
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,760
watching live or

2588
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,880
in replay or whenever wherever it was

2589
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,280
great

2590
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,040
times so thanks a lot and we're just

2591
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,360
getting started so

2592
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,360
for a little bit longer whoever wants to

2593
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,719
stay and if you want to leave just

2594
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,679
just no worries just drop off but um

2595
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,280
what's something that somebody wants to

2596
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,280
go into here or what's something that

2597
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,639
still people want to

2598
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:13,840
bring up

2599
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,719
one of the one of the things i'm

2600
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,639
wondering about is just the

2601
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,560
we've been taking this from a single

2602
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,199
individual perspective to some extent

2603
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,719
and in those group perspectives this

2604
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,199
kind of it's interesting that

2605
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,760
the simultaneity of all of it that the

2606
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,600
you you know you simultaneously have an

2607
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,320
individual

2608
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,239
that's this the how do we get a handle

2609
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,920
how do we help people get a handle on

2610
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,360
the the

2611
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,600
many levels that operate simultaneously

2612
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,719
and then one of the

2613
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,719
it then then how do we bring that to the

2614
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,639
current time the now

2615
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,000
where everyone is acting in this moment

2616
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,600
you know reading another paper now on

2617
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,520
fractal time and they say

2618
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,520
hey the past and the future don't exist

2619
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,679
if they do where are they show me

2620
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,360
right so the idea is now is all that

2621
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,000
exists so we have these

2622
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,800
priors which were that and we have these

2623
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,400
future projections which are that but we

2624
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,520
have the now

2625
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,520
and we all act in the now and all these

2626
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,040
myriad

2627
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,960
dynamics feed into the now

2628
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,840
and so it's such an interesting notion

2629
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,199
to me of how

2630
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,719
to trim tab systems as a lawyer

2631
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,239
you don't just we don't just observe

2632
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,360
we're always trying to push things in

2633
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,960
one direction or another for clients

2634
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:31,760
right

2635
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,120
or for whatever and so it feels like

2636
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,040
it's such an interesting thing that we

2637
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,040
have it's not just a now we have a

2638
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,159
series of nows

2639
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,159
available to us i guess because we in

2640
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,920
the diagram you see a series of now's

2641
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,400
right

2642
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:48,320
in the in the steps so

2643
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,880
it's interesting to that temporal aspect

2644
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,760
is something that's

2645
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,600
just not brought into so many systems

2646
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,679
right they're so static in so many ways

2647
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,199
and so in a sense like when you work

2648
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,280
with standards people they'll say oh it

2649
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,000
has to be

2650
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,400
robust so that we can plan based on it

2651
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,239
but it also has to be flexible

2652
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,080
and it feels like this naturally this

2653
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,280
analysis

2654
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,199
naturally lends itself once it becomes

2655
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,639
an institutionalized thing because our

2656
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,320
institutions now are not

2657
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,080
built on these analyses but once they're

2658
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,600
built on the dynamics

2659
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,199
where they're built on i'll use the word

2660
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,960
uncertainty but it's really

2661
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,120
embracing uncertainty or as i said in

2662
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,080
2014

2663
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,719
i called it entropy engines we were

2664
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,800
actually mining disorder

2665
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,480
in order to create order so anyway

2666
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,840
just a couple of things that thoughts

2667
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,760
that came to mind it feels like that

2668
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,199
time issue

2669
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,080
is relevant to our understanding how we

2670
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:40,880
can

2671
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:46,560
mind disorder cool stephen

2672
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,880
yeah the time issue is definitely a big

2673
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,040
part and we see that with these papers

2674
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,280
we've seen that there's the narrative

2675
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,840
approaches there's the reflective and

2676
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,199
now they're trying to get into the

2677
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,280
pre-reflective more

2678
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,679
and traditionally that's been you know

2679
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,040
meditation but

2680
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,360
what is the way that we understand these

2681
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,719
different time scales and i

2682
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,040
what i'd be interested in is is how does

2683
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,639
this link in with affordances i think

2684
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:11,920
there's something really interesting

2685
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,800
about

2686
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
that niche and the affordances in a

2687
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,320
niche because it gives away

2688
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,159
because it's sort of permanent therefore

2689
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,760
you know like that the path could still

2690
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,000
be there the cups can still be there

2691
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,199
yet my interaction with it can vary

2692
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,760
so i think that that's a a really

2693
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,960
interesting

2694
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,159
um way that experiments can tie a lot of

2695
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,960
this information or knowledge together

2696
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,840
sure so one idea we've talked a lot

2697
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,480
about is the idea of attracting sets or

2698
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,199
attracting

2699
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,760
states so for the perspective of your

2700
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,520
body with regards to temperature

2701
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,520
you want to be attracting back to core

2702
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,719
body temperature

2703
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,360
excursions outside of that range are not

2704
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,880
just bad they're lethal

2705
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,400
so attracting states are really

2706
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,320
important and just like you can have

2707
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,199
attracting sets of states on a single

2708
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,560
number line like temperature you can

2709
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,520
have

2710
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,920
in the wandering itinerant dynamics of

2711
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,840
thought you can have attracting

2712
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,600
thoughts and you can ruminate and you

2713
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,040
get too attracted or it can be too

2714
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,159
precise but

2715
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,320
it's an idea that people could be

2716
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,760
familiar with or not

2717
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,679
that attracting states can be thoughts

2718
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,280
so let's think about active inference

2719
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,159
the framework

2720
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,560
as an attracting state as something

2721
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,320
where we can in a room bring

2722
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,040
up these ideas and refocus the

2723
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,040
discussion or potentially expand or

2724
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,920
uh zoom in so we've brought up this

2725
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,960
multi-scale

2726
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,280
and the deep past in the deep future so

2727
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,800
it's multi-scale through space like the

2728
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,920
nested systems and then there's

2729
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,199
multi-scale through time

2730
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,800
there's molecules vibrating and then

2731
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,639
there's longer term things

2732
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,639
so let's start with the multi-scale

2733
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,800
space and time just being our starting

2734
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,520
position

2735
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,280
and then active inference goes further

2736
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,280
it says not just is it going to start

2737
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,760
being multi-scale in space and time but

2738
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,360
there's going to be non-linearity in

2739
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,440
uncertainty because there are causes in

2740
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,080
the world

2741
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,719
so rj and his alarm clock and his dog

2742
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,239
and something that you wouldn't expect

2743
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:03,120
changed in the world

2744
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,719
and that changed another part of the

2745
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,880
world that you basically wouldn't have

2746
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,840
expected

2747
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,239
um and also our action is always going

2748
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,080
to be constrained by our situational

2749
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,440
affordances in the niche

2750
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,600
so to steven's point there which is like

2751
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,280
it's all good to think about

2752
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,120
objectively what's happening but

2753
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,960
constrained by affordances in the niche

2754
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,000
that we're actually in

2755
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,239
is the operating conditions we have so

2756
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,840
it makes sense to at least ground the

2757
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,480
discussion

2758
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,639
in the affordances and then we're

2759
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,480
presented with attracting set of

2760
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,040
questions

2761
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,880
like how will we work together to be

2762
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,040
agents in a system of the type we would

2763
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,880
like to see

2764
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,199
that's a question that in various

2765
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,280
settings people could say

2766
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,520
oh well we don't have clarity on what

2767
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,719
kind of system

2768
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,880
we want to be in we need to reduce our

2769
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,920
uncertainty

2770
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,840
about what kind of system we're in

2771
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,760
that's visioning

2772
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,320
and clarifying mission but then there's

2773
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,520
other times where people say

2774
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,679
yeah how do we be the agents of this

2775
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,360
kind of a system that we want to be in

2776
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,920
so we're not uncertain about the mission

2777
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,040
about the end

2778
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,199
cybernetically but i'm just like

2779
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,520
honestly confused about what next role i

2780
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,480
should take

2781
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,360
in this system to make this happen

2782
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,560
according to the

2783
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,719
this mission that we've laid out and if

2784
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:17,920
my actions are consistent with the

2785
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,040
mission as we've laid it out then

2786
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,679
they're good

2787
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,360
but if they're not then they're just not

2788
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,960
helpful so

2789
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,520
we can start to combine a lot of these

2790
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,400
ideas

2791
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,880
and realize hopefully that whether we go

2792
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
deep into the physics side or into

2793
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:31,360
another

2794
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,679
aspect of active inference we'll use it

2795
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,520
as an attracting set

2796
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,320
and as this range in face space where we

2797
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,760
can bring the discussion

2798
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,320
and help ground it in the multi-scale

2799
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,199
insights

2800
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:44,960
in the non-linearity of the world and a

2801
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,840
few other things

2802
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,960
but i think it's really yeah and they

2803
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,320
really are

2804
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,440
they really are that

2805
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,719
like we we start our diagram with

2806
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,600
entities that have priors right we're

2807
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,880
not starting

2808
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,040
we i mean you could start with no priors

2809
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:05,920
and you're just

2810
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,840
wandering around in the dark in the

2811
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,120
woods

2812
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,040
but we're starting with a system that

2813
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,159
has

2814
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,880
something that we comparing the reality

2815
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,199
to

2816
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,560
right so they're trying to minimize the

2817
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,000
difference between their expectation and

2818
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,600
reality is that the free energy

2819
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,040
notion right so um

2820
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,600
so sculpting expectations at the front

2821
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,000
end is what education is an experience

2822
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,719
right and so with you know and when we

2823
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:31,360
can

2824
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,560
you know our system is

2825
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,159
our educational system the united states

2826
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,760
is set up for after the

2827
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,080
based on the prussian school system

2828
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,040
right that's the

2829
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,800
um the de-schooling society book by um

2830
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,719
ilitch so where our expectation is

2831
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,480
industrial workers well now we don't

2832
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,400
have industrial workers only we have

2833
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,320
service workers and so our educational

2834
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,840
system is not serving our

2835
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,080
folks for instance right so we have

2836
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,880
these

2837
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,560
um the those influences it's

2838
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,600
the the i guess the the thing that's

2839
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,360
the thing i keep coming back to it's

2840
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,679
like a situated cognition

2841
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,000
that we situate our cognition and

2842
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,440
externalities well

2843
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,440
those externalities also have our

2844
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,120
entities that have markov blankets you

2845
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,320
know right now we're

2846
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,560
thinking together right this is like

2847
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,719
plato you said you know dialogue lets us

2848
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,120
query consciousness so we're doing that

2849
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,400
um and each of us

2850
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,040
has our own view on on the direction of

2851
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:31,679
this thing

2852
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,440
right but they're so we're not

2853
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,040
interacting with static things

2854
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,560
we're interacting with dynamic things

2855
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,800
that have their own dynamics and the

2856
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,199
recruitment of those populations

2857
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:46,480
is i think a lot of what happens in

2858
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,800
legal concepts it's what's it's what

2859
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,600
right now

2860
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,120
i think this this the things we're doing

2861
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,719
right now could make a big

2862
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,760
impact on ethics discussions

2863
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,560
because ethics anything that's not

2864
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,760
written down in law

2865
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,679
but is bad is now called an ethical

2866
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:02,880
problem

2867
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,120
right it's just the ethics is carrying a

2868
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,960
lot of water right now for anxieties of

2869
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,239
people generally

2870
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,719
with the technologies and exponential

2871
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:11,840
increase in everything

2872
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,880
so it feels like we have an opportunity

2873
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,760
for intervention because there is a

2874
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,320
vacuum

2875
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,040
of meaning in the current institutions

2876
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,239
and it feels like this kind of

2877
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,000
explanation might be a nice way to get a

2878
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,280
toehold there

2879
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,440
let me build on that scott so there was

2880
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,000
a book i read called legal systems very

2881
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,280
different from our own

2882
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,800
by a fellow with the last name of

2883
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,560
friedman but it is not myself or a

2884
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,280
relative

2885
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,480
directly and it really does a great job

2886
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,600
of capturing

2887
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,040
how different legal systems from uh

2888
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,760
informal like criminal or prison legal

2889
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,320
systems

2890
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,320
justice systems using the term quite

2891
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,239
broadly to different world

2892
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,199
traditions very very different processes

2893
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,800
that they followed but also they had

2894
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,199
different

2895
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,520
ends in mind now the current operating

2896
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,560
environment

2897
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,800
not just are we being confronted with

2898
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,880
different uh interfaces mixing that

2899
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,440
hadn't

2900
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,760
combined before but also there's new

2901
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,639
challenges

2902
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,400
and so that's sort of like there was a

2903
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,760
you know a two-stroke engine and a

2904
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,040
two-stroke engine and a two-stroke

2905
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,639
engine and they all were kind of coupled

2906
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,480
in a way where they all were working

2907
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,880
internally and now they're being cobbled

2908
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,040
together and there's a lot of heat

2909
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,199
informationally so to speak there's a

2910
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,440
lot of parts that can burn

2911
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,800
because there's so much heat being

2912
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,360
wasted with the interfaces

2913
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,400
and so can three two-stroke engines be

2914
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,119
simply rewired into a six-stroke engine

2915
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,440
well no it doesn't really work that way

2916
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,480
how can you link those engines together

2917
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,280
into a system and that's really the

2918
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,080
question where

2919
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,440
we're um addressing here is narratively

2920
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,320
linguistically

2921
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,199
memetically but just formally as well

2922
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,119
how will these different systems

2923
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,199
get cobbled together so that we're

2924
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,639
actually connecting

2925
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,040
the gasoline to the car moving in

2926
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,679
forward one direction and in one piece

2927
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,920
not taking gasoline and making something

2928
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,360
that's just combustible

2929
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,960
but only hurting people yep this is this

2930
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,920
is where i

2931
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,960
suggested people read flatland

2932
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,880
because it's the adding of dimensions

2933
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,199
right you add the mr sphere comes in and

2934
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,239
lifts mr

2935
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,719
square up and he can see through you can

2936
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:21,600
untie a knot

2937
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,920
in the upper dimension without crossing

2938
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:24,800
the

2939
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,239
not the rope right so in law

2940
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,400
what we do is you create a new dimension

2941
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,360
so

2942
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,719
there was a time when we didn't have

2943
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:35,520
credit cards and people used to do run

2944
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,320
ious

2945
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,719
at the bar and things like that it just

2946
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,239
didn't exist

2947
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:43,920
and so credit cards now serve this huge

2948
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,119
function they de-risk huge swaths of

2949
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,480
interactions right but

2950
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,560
at one point they just didn't exist and

2951
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,719
this guy d hawk wrote a book called

2952
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,960
the k birth of the chaotic age and it's

2953
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,400
kind of a crappy book but it's kind of

2954
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,600
an interesting notion

2955
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,440
the banks were like no no no no we don't

2956
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,119
want your credit cards go away get out

2957
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,880
of here with a paradigm shift

2958
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,800
and then eventually they got the credit

2959
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,360
cards got in and now try taking the

2960
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,520
credit card fees away from the banks

2961
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,280
right so what was impossible becomes

2962
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,560
inevitable

2963
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,880
and it feels like because things are so

2964
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,960
stuck

2965
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,880
this kind of approach that we're talking

2966
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,000
about when

2967
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,960
taken in markets and institutions is

2968
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,480
going to that extra dimension

2969
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,199
of credit cards or swaps frees up it

2970
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,480
allows for these

2971
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,800
interactions to take place just like the

2972
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,679
extra dimension

2973
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,800
in flatland allowed for mr square to get

2974
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,239
new perspectives on

2975
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:39,600
his life in his existence so it's it's a

2976
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,480
really

2977
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,920
it's a fundamentally different and

2978
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,480
that's why they it's so interesting

2979
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,679
the mark of blanket nesting

2980
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,840
gets really interesting what which marco

2981
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,400
blanket can nest within another one

2982
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,679
and when you have communities of

2983
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:54,960
interest one of the things i always

2984
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,560
remind people of in new york for

2985
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,320
instance you have little italy

2986
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,159
you have a chinatown you have different

2987
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:01,840
areas where people go together because

2988
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,199
they're markov blankets their

2989
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,280
language is easier it's easier to

2990
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,400
communicate lowers the cost of

2991
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,920
communication lowers the risk

2992
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,760
you also have the jewelry district the

2993
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,000
the flower district and the

2994
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,400
cookware district economically people

2995
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,760
cluster together so communities of

2996
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,320
interest

2997
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,360
they're co-locating well here if we look

2998
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,719
at your diagram with the four

2999
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:21,920
states you know the two states on the

3000
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,000
left who sits right everyone is

3001
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,239
now accumulating going to communities of

3002
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,280
interest based on

3003
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,840
the dynamics or rigidity of that left

3004
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,320
hand

3005
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,560
two states you know oh do you share a

3006
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,920
risk do you share a

3007
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,719
solution but what if we could have

3008
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,159
communities of interest accumulated

3009
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:38,960
based on their

3010
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,360
capacity for change instead or something

3011
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,040
like that

3012
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,800
just to raise one really important piece

3013
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,320
then stephen is

3014
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,800
when people align around on the left

3015
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,239
side of that figure

3016
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,560
reducing risk or shared policy or shared

3017
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,360
culture

3018
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,159
it's often a similarity clustering okay

3019
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:56,800
so people

3020
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,560
often cluster based upon similar needs

3021
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,760
similar understanding of the world

3022
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,199
similar affordances

3023
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,600
but let's imagine um the reality of the

3024
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,560
organism

3025
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,400
which is that actually it's a clustering

3026
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,480
on the opposite in some senses of

3027
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,920
disjoint abilities so in this context of

3028
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:12,560
the body

3029
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,920
if you said well there's one kind of

3030
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,320
cell it can't move it just holds a bunch

3031
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,000
of fat and it literally just

3032
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,480
does hormone and fat processing and

3033
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,600
there's another kind of cell

3034
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,840
that will just dry out in a second in

3035
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,600
the sun but it can contract

3036
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,520
once and there's this other kind of and

3037
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,639
it's like you'd say

3038
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,920
they're not going to live in the same

3039
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,280
neighborhood together it's like oh wait

3040
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,000
no they do

3041
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,880
that's the body and so how are we going

3042
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:35,679
to

3043
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,840
interpret this all the levels of what it

3044
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,920
means to be a person economically and

3045
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:40,719
culturally

3046
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,520
and psychologically and understand that

3047
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,400
it's neither

3048
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,360
simple affinity nor simple dis affinity

3049
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,719
on any scale

3050
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,800
that will lead to function because

3051
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,560
function and islands of function are

3052
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,679
rare

3053
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:56,239
in the almost unimaginably large state

3054
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:56,880
space of

3055
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,600
possible legal codexes or possible

3056
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,560
programmings

3057
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,080
that could be done or possible

3058
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,760
personalities it's like there's more

3059
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,719
ways to fail

3060
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,880
for far from equilibrium systems and

3061
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,480
selection is the hand that just keeps on

3062
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,679
sweeping the ones that aren't working

3063
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:10,560
off the table

3064
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,239
so if we don't want to get swept off the

3065
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,560
table we're going to be working together

3066
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,639
that means coming together across our

3067
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,719
differences so that we can have these

3068
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:19,440
non-linear

3069
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,480
successes as larger systems not the

3070
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,280
largest

3071
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,600
system it's not a simple imperative but

3072
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,119
at the largest level that accomplishes

3073
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:27,679
our mission

3074
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:32,239
such as such interesting topics stephen

3075
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,040
yeah and this well just like you were

3076
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,320
just saying that about

3077
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,400
these different cultures and the niche

3078
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,719
construction i think this can help

3079
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,280
there's a lot of problems in terms of

3080
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,880
discourse around this

3081
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,480
not more broadly in the world and i've

3082
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,719
like when we talk about systems out

3083
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:51,600
there in

3084
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,800
like cities but then well how much is a

3085
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,600
system and how much has been an evolving

3086
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,560
niche construction some of which is

3087
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,840
constructed

3088
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,080
in this kind of linear you know this

3089
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,679
kind of teleological

3090
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,480
strategic way from above and and

3091
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,080
geographical wave

3092
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,880
and um but also some of it's just

3093
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,880
because that's the way it's evolved over

3094
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,400
time with some of this like we say these

3095
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,440
dynamics

3096
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,880
i think haven't really been brought in

3097
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,560
or if they are brought in that kind of

3098
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,080
ends up in the arts and it

3099
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,719
it all gets framed in whichever metaphor

3100
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:28,239
a particular

3101
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,400
sort of school is applying that you can

3102
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,679
get trapped by that

3103
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,199
and i think this this actually came up

3104
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,119
for me today so just like you're talking

3105
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,040
about the indigenous

3106
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,679
um ways you could have a governance or

3107
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:40,800
other ways

3108
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,679
is i think that we we have this idea of

3109
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,040
systems

3110
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,719
and these different systems and how do

3111
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,800
we integrate them and there's this

3112
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,880
assumption that they we need to be

3113
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,880
integrating them but

3114
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,679
like these indigenous systems you know

3115
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,360
it flips from one to the other so for

3116
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,159
instance

3117
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,920
we have our western system which seems

3118
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,600
to be like and we need to attack our

3119
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,440
system is quite a sort of a progressive

3120
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,560
leftist

3121
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,119
approach or we need to all revert to

3122
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:08,480
some sort of native

3123
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,639
indigenous system and they had it right

3124
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,480
and the body knows everything and if we

3125
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,000
just listen to our body and there's this

3126
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,840
kind of

3127
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,719
gap whereby how do you find a way which

3128
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,000
is kind of

3129
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,639
maybe configuring different approaches

3130
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:24,639
so it's like okay well where

3131
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,679
can we configure the

3132
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:29,360
other ways of knowing the other ways of

3133
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,119
governing other ways of

3134
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,280
and it's not just a case of like mash

3135
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,040
them together because they may just have

3136
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:38,000
a completely different dynamical

3137
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
process and then they don't integrate

3138
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,520
they just do different things at

3139
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,719
different times like

3140
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,920
cells do in the body

3141
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,400
of course it's all gonna come down to

3142
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,679
the details so

3143
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,560
you know none of these metaphors or um

3144
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,760
you know

3145
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,960
questions are even the beginnings of the

3146
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:57,600
answer

3147
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,760
but yes that's definitely where we want

3148
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,040
to be understanding

3149
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:05,040
at that level of societies is

3150
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,639
how much formal integration will there

3151
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,400
be now if somebody says i have

3152
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,400
i design the interface for different

3153
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,520
operations

3154
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,960
that is still coming from a cultural

3155
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,119
context so the challenge

3156
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,760
and part of the quest will be to frame

3157
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,840
that interface in a way that doesn't

3158
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,639
pretend that it has the neutral arbiter

3159
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:23,440
ability

3160
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,040
because that's actually one of those

3161
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,960
universalist fallacies that were fallen

3162
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,360
into

3163
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,239
by abstractionists now we want to be

3164
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,159
grounded in action and still talk about

3165
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,840
an interface for action

3166
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,600
and so i think actually that's why the

3167
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,040
task may be

3168
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,239
easier than the thought bringing

3169
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:41,520
together

3170
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,960
could be the action bringing together

3171
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,639
i'm always reminded of scott's example

3172
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,159
they told me a long time ago

3173
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,960
with two lumber yards that are competing

3174
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,639
in the market for selling lumber

3175
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,560
but then they have the same insurance

3176
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,840
and then i was like wait they also have

3177
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,360
some internet provider

3178
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,199
and they could pay taxes the same local

3179
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,600
government and they could have the same

3180
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,840
lunch service it's like everything

3181
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,639
except for

3182
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,760
lumber so it's like how many fronts they

3183
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:06,800
might even share

3184
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,920
a fence they so many areas

3185
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,840
so they're almost collaborative on more

3186
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,280
fronts than not

3187
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,119
and so how do we take this understanding

3188
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,280
that on overwhelming

3189
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,840
number of our edges and even for each

3190
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,080
edge on most of the domains

3191
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,040
there's just massive areas where we're

3192
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:25,360
in

3193
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,159
alignment and then risk can be

3194
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,000
catastrophic so it's like if we just

3195
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,960
reduce

3196
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,280
the amount of cascading failures in the

3197
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,960
system

3198
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,960
by playing to our strengths in the areas

3199
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,400
where we are aligned

3200
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,000
maybe all of a sudden now the lumber

3201
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,600
yard people it's like oh you like this

3202
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,960
kind of wood i like this kind of wood we

3203
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:43,600
should just

3204
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,440
niche partition but we're not going to

3205
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,520
go niche partition and fork and never

3206
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,320
talk

3207
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,600
if you're going to be selling the luxury

3208
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,800
and i'm going to be selling the consumer

3209
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,440
wood

3210
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,600
we need to have a better communication

3211
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,199
interface oh you have employees who

3212
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,239
speak this language

3213
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:57,360
and i have employees who speak this

3214
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,440
language well let's make an agreement

3215
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,360
that we're going to send numbers back

3216
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,440
and forth in this file type

3217
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,199
on these dates and here's who we're

3218
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,800
going to go to if that doesn't work

3219
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,440
it's like wow these two companies were

3220
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,880
fighting on the market

3221
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,639
in a previous or a different paradigm

3222
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,320
they might have you know

3223
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,040
been wasting money on advertising or

3224
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:17,920
committing different

3225
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,000
sort of gray zone interferences with

3226
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,119
each other's operation

3227
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,520
but just by reframing it in this

3228
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,520
multi-scale system

3229
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,199
even if you're not doing a government

3230
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,520
change whatever government system there

3231
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,000
is

3232
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,679
those two lumber yards now have a new

3233
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,360
way of talking

3234
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,600
to each other to their employees with

3235
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,480
their lawyers

3236
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,719
whatever potentially in a way that could

3237
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:40,000
lead towards them working together

3238
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,719
better

3239
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,480
so that's just very powerful i think

3240
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,159
that's what will be cool to continue

3241
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:45,920
returning to

3242
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,719
and and we're moving there really from a

3243
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:49,600
zero-sum

3244
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,639
game to a non-zero sum game

3245
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,560
right there's a winner in loser and what

3246
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,320
you do that's why you add i always think

3247
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,239
of that you add the dimensionality

3248
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:01,119
and it re casts the game as not a

3249
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:01,520
winning

3250
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,520
losing game and that's what we have to

3251
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,880
do in gaia theory

3252
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:07,440
right if you want to save the world from

3253
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,560
from us

3254
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,280
we have to recast the game as the as the

3255
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,960
entire game

3256
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,239
right this is the sustainable

3257
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,480
development goals even the u.n has them

3258
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,920
they're even tripping over them because

3259
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,920
they have some they had one power plant

3260
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,600
they developed the gujarat power plant

3261
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,800
in bangladesh

3262
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,800
and they scored big score on energy sdg

3263
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,520
and on development sdg and then they got

3264
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,960
sued by the local fishermen and the

3265
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,639
local population for pollution which

3266
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,320
would screw them on the other sdg

3267
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,960
they didn't even talk among the sdgs at

3268
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,639
the u.n now that's not surprising if you

3269
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,320
know the u.n and the institution

3270
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,000
but it shows you that it's even it's

3271
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,080
hard to integrate even when you have the

3272
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:44,800
the same

3273
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,159
source of the norms or the or the

3274
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,520
aspirations

3275
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,199
they just go for it on one of them and

3276
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:52,400
they don't they're not talking to each

3277
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:52,719
other

3278
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:55,760
right and here's why preventing failure

3279
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,960
is so critical

3280
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,560
um which body is healthier each organ

3281
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,880
system at 90 percent function

3282
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,560
or most of them at 99 and one is at zero

3283
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,000
well yep that body is dead so all of the

3284
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,920
functions need to be adequate

3285
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,920
or better and we need to improve

3286
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,440
adequate improve resiliency

3287
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,239
improve accessibility etc but preventing

3288
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:19,199
failure

3289
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,400
uh cannot be uh just

3290
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,040
part of the discussion on reducing risk

3291
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,960
reducing cascading failure

3292
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,920
has to be an imperative and so in that

3293
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,440
framework where we want multiple

3294
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,280
components to be functioning

3295
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,040
it just reframes the oh should the

3296
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,719
government be interfering here or should

3297
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,639
this person be undertaking this policy

3298
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,159
and again like i said like the task to

3299
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,320
synchronize on action might be easier

3300
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,199
than thought

3301
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,520
so those two lumber yards getting them

3302
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,719
to go to the same

3303
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,080
religious institution or send their

3304
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,840
children the same education or listening

3305
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,600
to the same youtube channels

3306
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,639
why why even go down that road

3307
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,880
in the metaphor when you could just

3308
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,400
offer them a service

3309
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,639
where they're de-risking their lumber

3310
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:01,440
business

3311
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,719
so instead of saying we'll synchronize

3312
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,639
these lumber yard people on

3313
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,560
this and then they'll just act nicely

3314
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,760
together it's like

3315
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,199
yeah or you could just provide the

3316
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,199
interface so that whoever they are

3317
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,280
however things change they'll be able to

3318
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,560
play nicely together

3319
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,080
instead of just saying well if we

3320
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,760
synchronize them in this way

3321
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,440
then they'll know what to do they won't

3322
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,960
because people don't well

3323
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,560
and that's why one of the things that i

3324
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,239
talk to people about as i say

3325
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,760
our recruitment that i'm doing in the

3326
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,520
program at the lab

3327
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,400
is not based on selflessness it's based

3328
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,159
on self-interest

3329
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,159
and the assertion is that they can

3330
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,679
de-risk in ways they cannot do

3331
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,840
unilaterally period

3332
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,360
that's what i tell people and so you get

3333
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,440
together so it's a commitment if they

3334
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,199
want to de-risk in these new ways they

3335
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,560
can't do it by themselves just like a

3336
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,679
stoplight

3337
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,440
i can't i didn't send out around a memo

3338
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,639
saying let's all stop at the red light

3339
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:49,920
that was done

3340
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,440
right these are these are scales that we

3341
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,360
can't do unilaterally

3342
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,400
and so that tempting that bait of saying

3343
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,679
you can go over there and

3344
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:00,239
like with swaps australia swaps were

3345
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,679
outlawed when they first came out and

3346
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,199
the banks in australia were getting

3347
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:03,920
killed

3348
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,199
because they couldn't swap out their

3349
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:07,440
interest rate risk so they lobbied the

3350
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,800
australian government

3351
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,880
to allow for swaps and then they did

3352
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,159
allow for swaps and they were

3353
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,000
able to swap out their interest rate

3354
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,159
risk like other banks

3355
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:18,480
the downside is they all then got hurt

3356
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,560
in 2008 when the swaps were used for

3357
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,159
speculative purposes that's a different

3358
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:23,119
problem

3359
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:26,320
but that invitation

3360
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,159
to de-risk in ways you can't do alone

3361
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:30,320
it's kind of it's that it's a crass

3362
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,320
way of getting people in the space but

3363
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,000
to me it's the hook that joins that

3364
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,360
left-hand side and the right-hand side

3365
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,119
with those four spheres

3366
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,480
because you right on the left-hand side

3367
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,920
you have this characterization of risk

3368
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,000
as a zero-sum game

3369
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,560
on the right-hand side well maybe it's

3370
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,000
not a zero-sum non-zero sum in that

3371
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,920
context but it allows for a bigger

3372
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,520
the dimensionality of de-risking

3373
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,599
increases when you increase the system

3374
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,679
size and so if you get those people who

3375
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,599
are similarly situated together

3376
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:57,440
it's new markets that's what trade

3377
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,119
associations are

3378
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:00,560
right trade associations people are

3379
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,320
competing all the potato chips

3380
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,080
lumber it doesn't matter trade

3381
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,239
association competitors get together

3382
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:07,920
and what do they do share information

3383
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,599
and insurance those are the two big

3384
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,840
things they co-insure for some whatever

3385
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,960
risk they share

3386
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,280
unless they can buy insurance cheaper

3387
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,639
whatever kind

3388
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,560
and they uh and they also share

3389
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:19,840
information so they can

3390
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,560
understand situational awareness better

3391
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,040
yep

3392
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,199
i put up the slide here again um

3393
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:30,320
yeah yvonne do you have anything you

3394
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,280
want to

3395
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,599
add or remark on no just chilling yeah

3396
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:39,840
okay continue scott

3397
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,080
wait weirdly i think we just lost

3398
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,199
scott's audio

3399
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:45,840
in between oh no okay okay sorry

3400
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,920
continue

3401
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,560
uh but i was thinking i there was some

3402
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,520
other thing i was going to say but i

3403
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,000
can't remember

3404
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,840
now about that oh yes yes there's an

3405
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,760
example from the fisheries industry

3406
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,480
so much this eleanor ostrom um worked

3407
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,440
very closely with people in the

3408
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,199
fisheries so a lot of fisheries

3409
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:04,320
are designed with ostrom notions and um

3410
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,280
so uh the of the commons and one of the

3411
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,280
things that a friend of mine who works

3412
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,759
in the um uh hold on a second

3413
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,880
okay stephen any okay sorry one of the

3414
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,599
guys

3415
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:21,360
sorry one of the guys who works in the

3416
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,840
um fishing industry he said

3417
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,040
they had a problem they have this thing

3418
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,880
called bycatch and it's the fish you're

3419
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,000
not supposed to catch

3420
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,679
so let's say i'm going to make up these

3421
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,199
numbers in this species but let's say

3422
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,800
you're allowed to catch 200 000 pounds

3423
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,239
of flounder

3424
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:36,239
but they would orange rock fish or

3425
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,159
yellow rock fish and if you catch four

3426
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:38,960
pounds of that

3427
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,400
you have to stop fishing it's a

3428
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,080
protected species

3429
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,560
you can't fish anymore you can't pay

3430
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,599
your bills you can't

3431
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,199
buy the oil you can't send your kids to

3432
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:49,520
school you don't have money

3433
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,360
so what they did they were trying to

3434
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,480
figure out how we're going to protect

3435
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:52,800
this

3436
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,760
orange rock fish the yellow rock fish so

3437
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,280
what they did is they said okay let's

3438
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,639
pool the allocations

3439
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:01,360
of different fisheries so if they had

3440
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,400
three guys

3441
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,800
each had a four pound allocation so they

3442
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,320
can pool it and make a 12-pound

3443
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,440
allocation

3444
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,239
so they can then what happens is if one

3445
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:11,760
of the one of the people

3446
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,920
goes out and fishes and catches five

3447
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,360
pounds of yellow rock fish

3448
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,679
he can still fish whereas he might in

3449
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:19,599
the past have had to stop

3450
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,119
so he spread the risk out but then what

3451
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:23,840
happens is the other fishermen

3452
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,920
start to be policemen because they're

3453
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,520
cutting it to their allocation

3454
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,599
so they go over and they say hey hey use

3455
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,520
a different size net or don't fish in

3456
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,040
that area whatever they share

3457
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,599
information because he's cutting in it's

3458
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:37,520
an economic loss for all of them because

3459
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,280
they pulled their allocation

3460
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:42,080
so to me that's a big deal that that

3461
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,639
that

3462
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:44,719
idea because what they're doing is

3463
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,159
they're spreading risk

3464
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,599
and when you spread risk it's like

3465
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,400
insurance if more people have claims out

3466
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:51,440
there

3467
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,480
and my premiums go up right so i'm going

3468
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:54,880
to

3469
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:59,119
encourage things that make things safer

3470
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:01,760
right as a stakeholder in that system

3471
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,679
and so similarly here

3472
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,119
it feels like when you move to that

3473
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,880
right side diagram

3474
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,920
we're going to have more avenues with

3475
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:10,639
which to

3476
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:13,040
create information flows among the

3477
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,159
parties

3478
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,000
that will actually de-risk better than

3479
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,080
the left side and make it cheaper

3480
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,520
stephen and then i'll have a point on

3481
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,679
that

3482
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:23,520
yeah i think this this use of this

3483
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,599
diagram could be important because

3484
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:28,880
yeah the in a way i suppose this diagram

3485
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,440
on the left it's like you either just

3486
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,119
put in laws

3487
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,599
or to mitigate those risks and

3488
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:36,560
challenges

3489
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,040
or the transdisciplinary tool that we

3490
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,000
have at our disposal

3491
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,920
is money money is the thing that

3492
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,560
everyone uses basically is the

3493
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,280
transdisciplinary

3494
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,960
allocation of what to do on projects and

3495
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,360
it doesn't it it's probably highly

3496
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,960
problematic and there's not

3497
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,639
really a lot of other things apart from

3498
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,560
what budget gets allocated that allows

3499
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,199
that so

3500
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,400
is there a way that this can provide

3501
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,040
us and and at different scales because

3502
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:03,760
sometimes yes

3503
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,239
it's fairly clean at kind of a national

3504
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:06,960
level or

3505
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,800
you know your rulers level and the

3506
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,080
individual but

3507
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,760
most stuffs happening in between as

3508
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,280
we're talking about

3509
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,520
how can we somehow get a handle which is

3510
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,119
not too culturally

3511
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:24,880
or metaphorically uh constructed but is

3512
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,320
is is is maybe relatively universal i

3513
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,679
know it's bad to use that term

3514
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:32,080
but i think there's something in that in

3515
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,599
in in being able to say okay this is how

3516
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,679
this information gains happen happening

3517
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,639
this is how this you know and now you're

3518
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,000
starting to have a way to

3519
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,199
talk about um dynamics

3520
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,119
um in ways which aren't normally

3521
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:46,320
possible

3522
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,040
yeah one thought on that and again to

3523
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,159
this point about

3524
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,840
you want to design the nexus the

3525
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,360
interface in a way that

3526
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,320
is inclusive and accessible but respects

3527
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,040
that not

3528
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,800
just do people disagree but they have

3529
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,719
actually different visions and

3530
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:02,239
understandings about this whole

3531
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,800
system that we're in and so here's and

3532
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,679
then

3533
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,679
where we can tie it to this figure and

3534
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:09,360
how it could be used to communicate and

3535
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,119
maybe even organize around

3536
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,679
so on the left side it leads towards

3537
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:14,639
abstraction

3538
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,800
because it's like well let's let's wait

3539
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:17,679
until we're

3540
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:20,719
less um ambiguous and then once you have

3541
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,239
no ambiguity it's like well let's figure

3542
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,159
out what the least risky policy is

3543
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,159
but guess what all the policies have

3544
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:28,080
risks and even if there was one that

3545
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,520
somehow had less risk than

3546
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,280
strictly all the others there's still

3547
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,040
black swan events and there's still

3548
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,080
people with different

3549
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,599
preferences for a given pipeline for oil

3550
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,280
or for a given fishing agreement

3551
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,400
so the idea that you're going to

3552
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,800
minimize risk for all parties in a way

3553
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,080
that they're satisfied with

3554
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,080
is going to be this quest that you're

3555
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,840
going to be at the the drawing board

3556
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,719
quite probably forever let's contrast

3557
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,080
that with the right side

3558
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,560
and you know the the authors i hope will

3559
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,400
be okay with us taking wide latitude

3560
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,119
because

3561
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:58,880
you know we're taking this figure beyond

3562
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,639
what yep it's frame but that's what's

3563
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:01,440
fun right

3564
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,360
yeah now let's go to that drawing board

3565
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,119
with uh um the power plant and the

3566
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:06,800
fishers and the ostrom and everything

3567
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,599
like that

3568
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:08,800
instead of just getting froze to the

3569
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,400
drawing board left so now we're on the

3570
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:11,040
right side

3571
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,400
and we're saying look we are at the

3572
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,320
drawing board so whether we're speaking

3573
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,159
through a translator or you believe that

3574
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,760
we have different interests

3575
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,719
we're here at the nexus so universal

3576
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,880
aside what's locally going to be working

3577
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,080
for our system

3578
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,119
well we have two imperatives we want to

3579
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:30,159
make maximum information gain but we

3580
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:33,040
want to maximize if you look at that iso

3581
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,400
given p it's not information gain on

3582
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,360
the observations that's this part see

3583
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,040
how it's strictly in the o

3584
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,480
here's ambiguity about state

3585
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,560
observations okay

3586
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:48,080
this is maximizing information gain on

3587
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:51,760
states and observations given policy

3588
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:54,400
in other words we're not just reducing

3589
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,599
our ambiguity

3590
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,440
about states the world like give me a

3591
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,440
more accurate stock ticker

3592
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,679
this is like hey what's the most

3593
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:02,639
informative

3594
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:05,840
uh policy that we can enact to learn

3595
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,119
about the states

3596
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:08,880
so we want to query the markets in a way

3597
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,080
that isn't just getting increased

3598
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,920
precision on viewing them

3599
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,679
and so now we're all at the table

3600
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,440
together so whether we believe ourselves

3601
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,199
to have or actually have adversarial

3602
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:19,360
interest in one dimension of 300 or

3603
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,840
all the dimensions or whatever we have

3604
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,119
an expansive

3605
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,520
maximization growth-oriented goal

3606
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,400
together

3607
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,119
which is implementing policy that helps

3608
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:29,520
us

3609
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,760
understand our system and the mapping

3610
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,360
between the hidden states

3611
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,360
and the observations better together now

3612
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,119
by doing that we're also engaging in

3613
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,239
joint action

3614
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:40,320
which will prepare us for larger and

3615
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,679
better action

3616
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,400
and what are we doing joint action to do

3617
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:44,800
well

3618
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,159
part of it is to be consistent with the

3619
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:47,599
kind of system who we believe ourselves

3620
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:48,320
to be

3621
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,239
but the other part the minimization what

3622
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:52,239
we're running away from the stick

3623
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:55,199
is disorder with respect to the

3624
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:56,560
observations

3625
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,239
so not with respect to us getting

3626
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:00,239
paralyzed about which policy

3627
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,880
but we want to reduce our surprise about

3628
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,880
our observations

3629
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,199
in the context of optimal policy okay so

3630
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:09,280
here how much co2 is there really in the

3631
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,199
world and how much do we really make and

3632
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:12,880
what would be the riskiest policy and

3633
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,560
should we just remove gas cars and i

3634
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,920
mean you could go down this rabbit hole

3635
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:16,960
forever right

3636
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,480
here is here's a predicted trajectory

3637
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,679
here's different types of models and

3638
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,760
what they predict about the trajectory

3639
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
of co2 levels through time

3640
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,920
and we want to reduce our uncertainty

3641
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:28,960
about that model

3642
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,800
together all kinds of people who believe

3643
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,920
different things we're going to reduce

3644
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:32,719
our uncertainty

3645
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:35,760
purely about observations as

3646
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,679
we jointly use policy together

3647
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:43,040
to learn more it's just such a positive

3648
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:44,560
way of framing it

3649
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,920
and again people are still going to

3650
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,760
disagree but we're

3651
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,440
coming to the table together so as long

3652
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,880
as we're not at arms and we're coming to

3653
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,000
the table together

3654
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,520
we don't need to go universal we don't

3655
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,040
need to go culture free

3656
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,199
we just say we're here we're figuring

3657
01:58:57,199 --> 01:58:58,239
this out today

3658
01:58:58,239 --> 01:58:59,760
for ourselves now and for other people

3659
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,280
later

3660
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,840
and when you that's beautiful i mean i

3661
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:04,800
you you

3662
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,719
i can't wait till i have more facility

3663
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,400
with the concepts because

3664
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,719
what you're describing the processes

3665
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:11,520
you're describing

3666
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,000
are going to become governance it's not

3667
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,440
like we're going to find governance of

3668
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,719
the processes

3669
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:18,480
those processes will be governance

3670
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,560
that's going to how it's going to happen

3671
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,800
and so it's a very the question is you

3672
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,480
know we're on the left side how do we

3673
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,840
get to the right side right what are the

3674
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,639
stages

3675
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,280
that we can do to move us over there how

3676
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,159
do we

3677
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:33,840
provide prepare ourselves as groups to

3678
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,840
be able to function on the right side

3679
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,119
in a natural organic kind of way one of

3680
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:40,800
the things that i've been advocating for

3681
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,880
is collecting practices from the left

3682
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,080
side

3683
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,080
but then having groups stare at the

3684
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,360
practices

3685
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,920
so you can say okay let's it's basically

3686
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,040
making different

3687
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,520
changing the assembly right the

3688
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,159
disintermediation

3689
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:56,480
of the left side has been done by the

3690
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,400
internet it's done by covid

3691
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,239
it's done by the big challenges to those

3692
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,560
systems they reveal the limitations of

3693
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,679
those systems

3694
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,760
and so the distance remediation is done

3695
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:06,960
on the right side we're going to

3696
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,400
re-intermediate

3697
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,480
because there is still mediation of the

3698
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:11,520
individual

3699
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,040
components in the system right they're

3700
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,400
brought together but we're

3701
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,199
reintermediating with a fundamentally

3702
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:18,400
it's it's fundamentally different in

3703
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,599
some ways in some ways it's quite

3704
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:20,480
similar

3705
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,599
and so one of the things that i'm

3706
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,080
interested in is trying to find ways to

3707
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,599
make it so similar that people don't

3708
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,199
even realize you know they or

3709
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:29,760
or they're comfortable with the move to

3710
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,639
this new

3711
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:33,520
framing of analysis very cool yeah

3712
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,119
stephen

3713
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:36,960
and this this ties in as well actually

3714
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,159
this is so good that you've gone through

3715
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,639
this diagram so it makes it very much

3716
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,679
jump out but this like the safe to fail

3717
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:46,480
approach of of trying to so if you

3718
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:47,840
imagine that policy

3719
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,560
will the red wheel on the on the right

3720
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:51,679
hand side

3721
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:53,920
you know active inference knows that

3722
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,599
that's really our choices

3723
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,960
are what we do with our policy we

3724
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,560
a lot of what's out there in the world

3725
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,320
the hidden states you know we only have

3726
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,000
so much control over

3727
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,599
so if we're able to almost

3728
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,040
shift the policies in there and

3729
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,040
and knowing that they're safe to shift

3730
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,719
so these safe to fail

3731
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:16,320
experiments which is what they talk

3732
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,800
about with so if you do safe to fail

3733
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,320
policies which means that you can then

3734
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:25,360
observe the states observe what

3735
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,440
observations observe the overlaps

3736
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:30,800
observe the dynamics over time

3737
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,000
then you've got an awful lot of um

3738
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,159
new information that you can use and

3739
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:37,760
obviously the key is to do

3740
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,679
not to have something in there which

3741
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,119
will be um

3742
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:43,360
there's this anti-fragile comes into

3743
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,560
that as well you know

3744
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:47,360
so you can learn as you do and and

3745
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,719
obviously knowing that

3746
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,159
there will be certain times when you've

3747
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:52,000
got to pull away and

3748
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,800
stick to a you know risk minimization

3749
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,080
focus but

3750
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,239
this you know it gives a way to talk

3751
02:01:58,239 --> 02:01:59,199
about that

3752
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:01,440
probably to people from very different

3753
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,560
views of the world

3754
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,480
yep so another metaphor there with

3755
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,560
performance would be like a martial art

3756
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,040
and the safe to fail and the sparring

3757
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:09,840
and the play

3758
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,679
so there's times to play and you know

3759
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,119
for children and there's times to be

3760
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:14,800
serious but no matter what you're doing

3761
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,400
it's always serious because people can

3762
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:16,880
fall

3763
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,560
if you're walking you can fall if you're

3764
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,400
talking you can say something mean

3765
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,560
if you're you know holding data you can

3766
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,320
lose the data so everything is very

3767
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,199
important

3768
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:27,840
and so we need to have that resilience

3769
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:28,639
in mind

3770
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:30,719
one other way in which this can be used

3771
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:32,400
so this is um

3772
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,880
putting a little bit beside this uh

3773
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,520
purely

3774
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,760
like somebody at the table who doesn't

3775
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,960
want to communicate with us

3776
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,480
scenario so now we're in a situation

3777
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,239
where like people want to work together

3778
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:44,000
at least they've bought on to that level

3779
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,599
okay

3780
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:47,040
we're talking about the system and

3781
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,639
someone just has this figure up you know

3782
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:50,000
just as they do

3783
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,920
and steven you said it like what we

3784
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,679
control is policy we control

3785
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,199
climate policy you know what we don't

3786
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:57,119
control the climate but what do we

3787
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:57,679
control

3788
02:02:57,679 --> 02:02:59,440
our climate policy we don't control

3789
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,000
biogeochemical cycles we influence them

3790
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,239
but we don't control the outcome and so

3791
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:05,440
people could be talking

3792
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,560
and someone's like well i want to see

3793
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,480
this okay you're talking about c you're

3794
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,520
talking about your preference

3795
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,760
vector and someone said or are we

3796
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,199
talking about the state of the world are

3797
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:14,400
you actually saying that this is how

3798
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,000
people feel or are you just stating your

3799
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,280
preferences about the world because it's

3800
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,880
fine if you want to you know i i want to

3801
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,560
learn about your preferences

3802
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,800
and remember your preferences are the

3803
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:23,840
key factor

3804
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,800
that really go into our policy but our

3805
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,440
policy

3806
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,199
is not the same thing as the states

3807
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,119
about the world yeah so it's like okay

3808
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:32,560
now what are the observations some says

3809
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,960
no no actually it's 80 percent

3810
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:37,440
so okay your inference is that this is

3811
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,239
80

3812
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:39,520
is that right well here's this

3813
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,760
observation oh well this study is biased

3814
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:42,159
okay

3815
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:43,360
well great let's you know what if it was

3816
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,360
a factor of two so there's so many ways

3817
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,880
just to have this figure up

3818
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,199
and someone says are you sure about that

3819
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,560
policy selection

3820
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,920
say okay well it sounds like we're up

3821
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,599
here sounds like we're in the

3822
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:56,000
metacognitive world we're thinking

3823
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,520
implicitly about our own group's

3824
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:58,639
generative model

3825
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,840
of this policy decision making process

3826
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:04,239
and it seems like you're uncertain about

3827
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:05,599
this

3828
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:07,040
and what are you uncertain about okay

3829
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,000
what could we figure what could we

3830
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,040
reduce uncertainty about

3831
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,960
is it your preferences is it the way

3832
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,239
that your preferences and our

3833
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:13,040
uncertainty

3834
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,760
are being combined with the affordances

3835
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:16,560
and the niche

3836
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,560
into policy that of course is the

3837
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,320
hardest not to untie that's control

3838
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,360
theory and everything

3839
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,960
but you can at least say hey is it your

3840
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:25,360
uncertainty is it your preferences

3841
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:28,880
is it the niche perception affordances

3842
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,239
not just the preferences but the niche

3843
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:32,320
itself e the prior

3844
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,079
and is that being combined in a way that

3845
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:36,079
makes sense to generate policy

3846
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:37,679
because if you disagree with the policy

3847
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:38,880
which part of these was it because

3848
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,400
that's all that went into it

3849
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,840
so don't just say you disagree with the

3850
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,679
policy tell me do you want something to

3851
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:44,079
be

3852
02:04:44,079 --> 02:04:45,440
do you value something that wasn't

3853
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,199
valued by this policy

3854
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:48,560
okay now that we're talking about a

3855
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,280
given policy do we have synchronization

3856
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,760
at least coarsely on the starting state

3857
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:55,520
not on all the details but at least like

3858
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,440
the starting state for our scenario

3859
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:59,040
and are we talking about states the

3860
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,840
world do you believe that our policy

3861
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,440
is going to influence the b you think

3862
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,199
that the cutting the miles per gallon to

3863
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:07,199
20 is gonna change the way that the

3864
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:07,840
hidden state

3865
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:10,000
co2 in the world changes through time

3866
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,280
you think it's gonna do that

3867
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,440
well i don't think it's gonna do that or

3868
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:14,960
i you know think it's gonna do this

3869
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,840
instead

3870
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,840
and so now we have an interface okay

3871
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,119
policy is how

3872
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:20,960
states of the world are changing not

3873
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,800
just as a function of models

3874
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,440
of prediction but as a function of our

3875
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,119
interference in the system

3876
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:28,639
and it's going to be manifested in

3877
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:31,199
observables not just we believe that 80

3878
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:32,639
of this will be happening by this future

3879
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:34,800
time but rather

3880
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,400
as a function of policy we're going to

3881
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,079
see these observables and if we're

3882
02:05:38,079 --> 02:05:39,599
surprised by the observables we see

3883
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:40,639
along the way

3884
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:42,400
we're going to be course correcting and

3885
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,239
we're going to be at the same table

3886
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:47,679
again so there's so many actual

3887
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:50,719
structural ways to talk about this i

3888
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:54,079
think and as well as narratively

3889
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:56,560
that people could even having this up

3890
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,920
maybe it could be simpler than this one

3891
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,679
maybe kind of a few more pieces

3892
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,440
but just separating out where people

3893
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,719
disagree it's like

3894
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,280
yeah in a legal i don't know yeah in a

3895
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:06,639
legal system i could imagine this being

3896
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:07,760
useful too

3897
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,000
oh it would have to be recast as

3898
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,360
something that people wouldn't you know

3899
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,719
fall out of the chair because legal

3900
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:13,840
people don't like to see

3901
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:18,239
squiggly latin and greek symbols but

3902
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:21,440
but the but the absolutely no question

3903
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,800
the way you described it what you're

3904
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,480
doing is you're really mapping

3905
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:27,520
i mean it's teaching and you're and and

3906
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,679
and showing people you know whenever you

3907
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:31,360
have a map that says you are here

3908
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,800
you know when you're lost in the zoo or

3909
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,719
something like that and really it's a

3910
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:35,920
you are here map

3911
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,159
right so cge you know it's and it's

3912
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:39,920
allowing more granularity

3913
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,520
and it's offering more dimensionality

3914
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:42,880
for solutions right because if people

3915
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,239
are just talking about policy

3916
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:45,599
they'll be ambiguity if they're not

3917
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:47,760
talking about c g or e

3918
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,360
yes yeah what are your preferences see

3919
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:54,560
what are the field of affordances e

3920
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,119
and the prior over those like the quote

3921
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:58,159
nuclear option

3922
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:01,040
it's an affordance and it's the last

3923
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:01,840
resort

3924
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,320
so tied up in the affordance is how

3925
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,400
likely it is that's your prior over

3926
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,440
policies

3927
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,440
so you have the field of affordances and

3928
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:10,719
the prior about them

3929
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:12,800
and then you have your preferences c i

3930
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,400
want to see a world where there isn't

3931
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,400
radioactive fallout and then you have

3932
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,159
your uncertainty

3933
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:21,679
and then those get combined in a way

3934
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:24,880
that is formalized with g and that

3935
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:25,599
relates to

3936
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:28,560
pi policy selection being the outcome of

3937
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,679
the free energy

3938
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:32,239
being minimized which is again what's

3939
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:33,760
the most likely policy

3940
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,360
and someone's like wait most likely it's

3941
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,960
like right but most likely

3942
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,719
under the model of the world that you

3943
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:40,800
believe will happen

3944
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,480
not just the one that you think is like

3945
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:44,000
the run of the mill because quote the

3946
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,079
run of the mill is not run-of-the-mill

3947
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:48,800
yeah it's really interesting because i

3948
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:51,679
mean you're integrating subjectivity

3949
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:56,400
into an analysis of the reality

3950
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,599
in a formal way it

3951
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:02,000
has that i believe that this is where

3952
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,679
the dual instrumentalism is the most

3953
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:04,719
powerful thing

3954
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:07,280
in the fep zone so the dual

3955
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,000
instrumentalism

3956
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,840
again it's like there's it's also kind

3957
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,040
of like a bailey and mott

3958
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:11,920
i don't know if that's being

3959
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,119
mispronounced but like where there's a

3960
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:15,360
strong and a weak form of an argument

3961
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,000
so again the strong claim would be this

3962
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,840
is what systems are and this is how

3963
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:20,239
they're

3964
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:22,480
um operating that is what a bacteria is

3965
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,320
that is what the markov blanket is

3966
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,719
but the actual beaker claim is just

3967
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:28,239
we're going to use it as an instrument

3968
02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:30,159
it's like yeah we use linear aggressions

3969
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:32,079
to mod in time series modeling

3970
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:34,639
to model gdp through time or regression

3971
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:35,520
of you know

3972
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,599
height versus risk for some disease it's

3973
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:38,800
like it didn't say

3974
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,719
people are linear regressions by doing

3975
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:43,280
that it did lead to a world in which

3976
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,480
certain types of conclusions were

3977
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,040
reached

3978
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,719
but it wasn't that people were linear

3979
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,719
models it was actually consequences

3980
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:50,239
so this is just a different statistical

3981
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:52,159
model and as we're

3982
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:53,679
exploring today and we'll continue to

3983
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:56,480
explore even qualitatively it helps

3984
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,920
structure

3985
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:01,280
messy discussions about adversarial

3986
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,480
relationships

3987
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,960
and in that way which we're only barely

3988
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,960
scratching the surface of like you know

3989
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,639
really formalizing the markov blankets

3990
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:10,320
around companies and things like that

3991
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,239
having this type of a structuring and

3992
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:14,480
being able to be uh disambiguous

3993
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:17,040
but it could be so much more it could be

3994
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:18,880
translated between languages

3995
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,599
it could be diversions it could have

3996
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:22,719
impartial

3997
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:26,320
um you know trust providing uh groups

3998
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,960
there's so much that could be done there

3999
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,960
and it's funny because

4000
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,880
so one of the books i have on the shelf

4001
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,560
here is uh by hannemann it's called

4002
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,079
doing money

4003
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:38,400
and it's about how money is a universal

4004
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,880
risk consolidator

4005
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:42,320
so you know you get money and you can

4006
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,480
take care of your other risks basically

4007
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,840
so one of the things i've been wondering

4008
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,679
about is well money's kind of turned

4009
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:49,199
into data because you don't really spend

4010
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,040
cash anymore

4011
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,320
so why can't data itself without being

4012
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,360
monetized be a universal risk

4013
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:00,960
um mitigator

4014
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,320
stephen you cracked me up when you said

4015
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,000
that money was transdisciplinary

4016
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,440
i've never heard you know people say

4017
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,040
that trans discipline research but never

4018
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,719
it's so true though the departments will

4019
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:10,000
pay each other and money

4020
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,360
they won't cite each other but they'll

4021
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,599
pay each other so it's so true

4022
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,800
and so and so that but data can data now

4023
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:20,000
be and can this system

4024
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,679
because money we you go to an airport

4025
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:23,040
you got to convert one system into

4026
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,719
another so there's different

4027
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:27,360
encoding of the bills themselves right

4028
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:28,159
okay so that's

4029
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:30,320
but but ultimately i always tell people

4030
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,760
if i walk out of if i'm outside a

4031
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,199
courthouse and someone says i just got a

4032
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,880
ten thousand dollar judgment

4033
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,560
i don't know if it's for a divorce case

4034
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,320
a slip and fall i mean it's money it's

4035
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,840
ten thousand dollars is identical

4036
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,920
you can buy the same amount of groceries

4037
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,599
but it could be for various different

4038
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:44,480
things that you were

4039
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:47,520
you were compensated right so in

4040
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,679
data it feels like this model might

4041
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:50,800
allow us to have

4042
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:54,480
data be a medium of exchange

4043
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,719
and maybe storage i don't know i won't

4044
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:57,760
go into that right now

4045
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,599
but immediate exchange of risk without

4046
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:01,440
having to go through the monetary

4047
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:05,040
loop very

4048
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:08,880
very interesting yep i can

4049
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,400
kind of imagine some areas stephen

4050
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,960
and this this might be where bringing

4051
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,960
the body back in can help too

4052
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:19,840
as we you know you talk about like

4053
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:22,320
there's there's money in my hand

4054
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,159
there's there's money that we talk about

4055
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:25,360
when you get it or something and then

4056
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,639
there's capital

4057
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:30,079
which is almost like an augmented um

4058
02:11:30,079 --> 02:11:32,159
cognition process which is up there in

4059
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:33,599
the markets you know that we've

4060
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:35,199
offloaded onto

4061
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:38,719
and is very hard to embody

4062
02:11:38,719 --> 02:11:41,199
what's going on up there yeah it's it's

4063
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:42,320
like it goes off

4064
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,800
it does its calculation it comes back

4065
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:45,679
and we do what

4066
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:47,119
i mean half the people doing are doing

4067
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:50,320
on screens who themselves are being

4068
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,800
proxies for other people you know so

4069
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:53,360
there's

4070
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:56,000
there's there's a question about um

4071
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,560
where this comes back into

4072
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,760
ultimate um sense making at different

4073
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,040
time scales yep

4074
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:06,480
yep yeah ivan was smiling before i

4075
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:08,400
did were you smiling at the money thing

4076
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,840
let's let's maybe have yeah

4077
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:11,840
let's have uh anything you want to go

4078
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,760
there yvonne if you want otherwise let's

4079
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,480
have a little

4080
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:17,280
closing just imagine you and you and

4081
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,639
your money

4082
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:22,800
and your money of new people

4083
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,040
yep so maybe we'll have a final set of

4084
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,000
thoughts so prepare

4085
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,440
that but the other side um scott of the

4086
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:34,560
the money uh trading in the airport

4087
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:38,000
is that uh in a healthy system

4088
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,239
every sale is bi-directionally

4089
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:42,159
consensual every agreement is not

4090
02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:42,639
feeling

4091
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:45,840
forced it's like so somebody wanted your

4092
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,639
peso the other person wanted the yen so

4093
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:50,000
they made a deal they met in a

4094
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,880
marketplace

4095
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:51,760
they wouldn't have found it on

4096
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,760
craigslist the operating cost would have

4097
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,960
been too high but

4098
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,040
somebody wanted it now when does it

4099
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,239
become deranged

4100
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:01,040
well when there's um extra market forces

4101
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,000
that force people to do

4102
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,480
things or when there's you know

4103
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:05,360
devaluation

4104
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:08,159
market manipulation etc etc but again

4105
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:09,440
it's not like there's a pure

4106
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,920
untrammeled market out there and then

4107
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,000
it's like oh regulation how dare they

4108
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,400
it's actually we construct the market

4109
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,320
it's like we're building the bowl

4110
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:19,679
so it's not just like there's a pure

4111
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:21,360
bowl and then you've defined it by

4112
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,960
putting clay on it it's like

4113
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,520
no what is the structure that you're

4114
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:26,239
going to be

4115
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:29,520
interfacing in and can that not just be

4116
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,079
imbued

4117
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:32,960
with our values which aren't going to

4118
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,639
always have justification they're often

4119
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:35,920
asthmatic

4120
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,360
but can actually allow diverse agents

4121
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,840
to act according to their deeply held

4122
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:42,639
axioms

4123
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:44,960
so that there is ability of people who

4124
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,639
have different faith

4125
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:48,960
in different things yeah and it's been a

4126
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,320
joke for so long oh you don't need to

4127
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:51,360
believe in the legitimacy of the

4128
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:54,079
government to use the currency if a fiat

4129
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:56,320
and now we're just seeing it in a new

4130
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,520
light

4131
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,599
so it's real it's really interesting the

4132
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:00,560
market may be

4133
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:03,280
just an emergence from the fact of

4134
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,679
information seeking in trades

4135
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:07,840
yep and also leveraging and how that's

4136
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,520
trust like there's bitcoin on the

4137
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:10,159
blockchain

4138
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:11,360
just these are the examples i think

4139
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,520
about um yep but

4140
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:15,679
then there's the 10x leveraged bitcoin

4141
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:17,119
who legitimized

4142
02:14:17,119 --> 02:14:20,639
that exchange or that person to um

4143
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:23,440
offer a 10x leverage or some other type

4144
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:24,719
of asset based upon

4145
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:26,400
leveraged on bitcoin nobody gave that

4146
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,719
permission if that person or that

4147
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:30,639
operation is reputable

4148
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:32,480
um and to whatever extent it is it will

4149
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,760
succeed or hopefully

4150
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:35,599
and again anything other than that is

4151
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:37,040
dysfunction so

4152
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,880
there's a way to talk about that in a

4153
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,480
way that is pretty

4154
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:43,280
different from the reward optimization

4155
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:45,280
of different competing agents

4156
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,880
that's previous paradigm reward

4157
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:49,040
optimization competitive agents

4158
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,239
and we're not just moving from

4159
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:52,239
competitive to cooperative

4160
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:54,079
it's actually not that simple it's

4161
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:55,360
actually more about

4162
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:58,880
from the uh reward to the precision

4163
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:01,360
guiding mindset and that everything else

4164
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,119
falls in line after that

4165
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:05,679
and the action and the precision are the

4166
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:06,880
key pieces

4167
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:09,679
some of the keys and so that's the

4168
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:10,560
coherence

4169
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:13,679
lending factor yes we want to be precise

4170
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:14,480
about process

4171
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:17,760
together that's the minimal meme not

4172
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,520
we're going to have abundance in the

4173
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:20,960
future but

4174
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,280
today we're going to have precision here

4175
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:28,400
yep so it's really yeah

4176
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:31,840
it's a it's a different it's really

4177
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,960
fascinating the way it's going to

4178
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:34,880
iterate itself into

4179
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,880
it's more scalable but it's not yet

4180
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:39,119
scaled

4181
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:40,880
yeah you know i think of it makes me

4182
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,719
think of adaptation studies i have a

4183
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:44,239
book on cambridge uh book

4184
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,400
adaptation studies in theater where if

4185
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,159
you take romeo and juliet you translate

4186
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:49,360
it into another language

4187
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,360
you got a lot of work to do because

4188
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,400
there's a lot of phrasing

4189
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,920
and there's a lot of behavior a lot of

4190
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:55,679
things for adaptation

4191
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:57,280
what we're doing here is it's just like

4192
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:00,480
a giant simultaneous adaptation

4193
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:04,079
vehicle right because everyone's coming

4194
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:05,520
in with priors

4195
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:08,960
and this system allows people to

4196
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:12,800
discover things that they have in common

4197
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,840
it allows them to act in common

4198
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,760
and that's going to have such huge power

4199
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:21,119
it won't and it won't be something that

4200
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,440
will create spaces for it it will create

4201
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,320
the space

4202
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:27,440
this the interaction space will

4203
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,400
evolve and then be and then it'll be

4204
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:32,398
parameterized in metrics and you'll know

4205
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:33,599
if you're in it or not there'll be

4206
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:34,478
certain behaviors

4207
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:37,519
that indicate you're in it right but

4208
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:38,799
it's it's that's why i always say the

4209
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:40,799
process becomes the governance

4210
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:42,398
it's not you don't that's a lot of

4211
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:44,478
people there's the ai problem right now

4212
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:45,840
not our ai but the artificial

4213
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:46,718
intelligence

4214
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:48,160
that everyone is trying to create

4215
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,000
everyone that i can find is trying to

4216
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,280
create systems

4217
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,439
to govern the people creating the ai but

4218
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:56,318
not the ai system itself

4219
02:16:56,318 --> 02:16:58,080
and i'm thinking more along the lines of

4220
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,920
asimov which is you need the rules for

4221
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,840
the robots themselves

4222
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,398
similarly here each one of these systems

4223
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:06,398
is a robot

4224
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:09,040
it's not program bias per se but it's

4225
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:10,799
caused by us

4226
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:14,160
and it has features that are

4227
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:16,718
the result of our desires and needs so

4228
02:17:16,718 --> 02:17:18,318
it's programmed in that way

4229
02:17:18,318 --> 02:17:20,080
corporations are robots i think they're

4230
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,080
programs part of our constructed niche

4231
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,160
is how we would consider it it you're

4232
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:25,120
never going to break away

4233
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,638
it's intertwined with us it's in our

4234
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,558
niche yep right

4235
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:31,040
right and so the so it's interesting

4236
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,638
because i think a lot of

4237
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:35,840
folks look at authority

4238
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:39,200
like the fiat money is i think the u.s

4239
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:40,959
is a fiat not just because of rule of

4240
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:42,638
law but because of a monopoly of

4241
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:43,679
violence

4242
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:48,080
we have the most guns and bombs

4243
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:50,558
and so that it's a violent it's violence

4244
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:52,000
and imperialism and all that stuff

4245
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,599
that's wrapped up in

4246
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:56,398
fiat right there's a power there and i

4247
02:17:56,398 --> 02:17:57,760
think the power is shifting from

4248
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,840
physical violence to other forms of

4249
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,959
information

4250
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:02,398
and we use the word violence here but

4251
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:05,280
information authority and it feels like

4252
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:08,318
the ability of this system to declare

4253
02:18:08,318 --> 02:18:10,718
that it can get you closer to reality

4254
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:12,799
continuously it's dynamically

4255
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:14,160
it's like the scientific method it's

4256
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:16,478
dynamically re-jiggering itself

4257
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:18,240
i wouldn't say closer to truth i would

4258
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,718
say towards a better process together

4259
02:18:20,718 --> 02:18:23,200
yes dynamically right yep that's right

4260
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:24,718
there's no there is no end state of

4261
02:18:24,718 --> 02:18:25,679
truth yep

4262
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:29,760
but that value proposition is not

4263
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,638
characteristic of the current systems

4264
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:33,359
and so

4265
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:37,040
it has a unique feature of the de-risks

4266
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,840
in a way that's much

4267
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,359
more effective than the current systems

4268
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:46,160
it requires people to do the cooperative

4269
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,558
thing

4270
02:18:46,558 --> 02:18:48,478
which is like i said with credit cards

4271
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:50,000
or atms or

4272
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,879
swaps or anything with mitochondria

4273
02:18:54,879 --> 02:18:57,040
right you know your free existing things

4274
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,240
have to come together because there's a

4275
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:00,799
better deal to be had right

4276
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:03,359
so that's and so that so the convey are

4277
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:05,040
conveying why there's a better deal to

4278
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,160
be had

4279
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,240
we can use the existing problems in the

4280
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:10,080
world climate change

4281
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:13,280
war it's not even a better deal

4282
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,318
it's a better negotiating table yes and

4283
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:17,359
that's that's right that's

4284
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:19,920
always the reframe is always from yes

4285
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,959
there will be better

4286
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:24,000
states to we're gonna seek precision

4287
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,558
today

4288
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:27,519
yes beautiful beautiful and that gets

4289
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:28,398
back to that

4290
02:19:28,398 --> 02:19:30,558
now versus past and future thing that i

4291
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:32,160
was struggling with before

4292
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,080
right we're not gonna we're not saying

4293
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,718
it's better it's it's a better way

4294
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:39,840
to be and we don't know where being

4295
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,959
takes us because that's we have models

4296
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,478
of it you have a model i have a model we

4297
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:45,840
have a model let's get together

4298
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:48,080
figure out where we want to be the

4299
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:49,760
reality is the common

4300
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:53,359
synthesis of those desires i guess

4301
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:56,960
as evolving through time closing closing

4302
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:00,080
statement from first stephen then yvonne

4303
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:00,720
if he wants

4304
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:04,720
then back to scott well yeah i suppose

4305
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:08,000
the takeaway um and there was

4306
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,920
you had the e the g what was the third

4307
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:11,200
letter again there was a

4308
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,080
c is the preference okay let's see i

4309
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:15,280
think that's really useful i think

4310
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,000
that's like a

4311
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,319
nice meeting point there between and i

4312
02:20:18,319 --> 02:20:19,359
keep coming back to this but the

4313
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:21,200
ergodicity and non-ergodicity

4314
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:23,439
in the sense that you know as you get

4315
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:24,880
down to the smaller scale

4316
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,960
the body and i think even when you get

4317
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:29,600
into this outside of cognition

4318
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:31,040
everything's got to follow that growth

4319
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:32,720
kind of ergotic kind of

4320
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:34,640
churn and then you start to have this

4321
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:37,280
ability to bring in these non-ergodics

4322
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,160
as we get to larger time scales and you

4323
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:40,640
know

4324
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:43,760
we even see as we get now to the state

4325
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:44,399
and how

4326
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:47,120
you can borrow money in ways which an

4327
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:48,800
individual can't we've seen this with

4328
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:49,840
the eu

4329
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,840
because they're not constrained by

4330
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,920
lifespan in the way that mortgage

4331
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:56,319
mortgages are so you've got this weird

4332
02:20:56,319 --> 02:20:59,280
ability to bring in preferences in that

4333
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:02,560
um about of non-ergodic sort of ways of

4334
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:04,319
just making a choice and creating

4335
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:06,479
deliberately steady state like a fiat

4336
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,960
currency the whole point is it's steady

4337
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,439
and non-ergodic but we actually and this

4338
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:12,800
is where i think a lot

4339
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,880
of the work with the indigenous cultures

4340
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,319
is they are they could say they're

4341
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:17,680
trapped in the old

4342
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,920
cyclical way of understanding the world

4343
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,800
but actually

4344
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:23,600
that gives you a way to tune into your

4345
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:25,840
deeper existential way of knowing

4346
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,800
about the long-term future because that

4347
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:29,680
is

4348
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:31,280
where your phenotype knowledge comes

4349
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:32,720
from

4350
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:35,600
not um you know the okay off we have

4351
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,640
these structures that

4352
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:40,000
give us this ability to also do deep

4353
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,640
temple

4354
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:44,000
depth but we do lose the ability to

4355
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,720
integrate

4356
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:47,280
free energy in such a new york the

4357
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,040
dimensions come down and down and down

4358
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,720
and down to these kind of

4359
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:53,359
artifacts so yeah this is anyway this is

4360
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:53,760
what

4361
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:56,560
is coming up for me thanks well i hope

4362
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:58,080
steven that you and others

4363
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:01,120
can in the future you know listen back

4364
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,560
to what you've laid out

4365
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:05,120
and hopefully see it in a broader

4366
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,240
perspective

4367
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,640
what you were hinting at yvonne any

4368
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,240
closing thoughts for 2020

4369
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:15,439
indeed yeah sure i just want to uh

4370
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:17,439
thank you all for brilliant discussion

4371
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:18,479
and it's

4372
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:21,040
the great discussion for the enter of

4373
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:22,560
this

4374
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:27,040
strange year i hope to see you all

4375

next next from the beginning from the

4376
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:32,240
january

4377
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,399
and thanks for your help in the project

4378
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:36,479
from the beginning really

4379
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:39,520
critical yeah so very chill scott

4380
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:42,479
closing thought you guys are this is

4381
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:44,640
this is beautiful you guys are beautiful

4382
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:48,840
this is awesome i'm i feel like a

4383
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:51,680
metamorphosis i'm i'm i'm going to

4384
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:53,280
pupate a little bit

4385
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,120
and then i'm going to come out after the

4386
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,359
new years and be ready to fly with you

4387
02:22:57,359 --> 02:22:58,080
guys this is

4388
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,720
this is really delightful and

4389
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:01,600
fascinating

4390
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:04,880
and i think it's going to be really um

4391
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,960
very helpful to a lot of problems that

4392
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,479
are out there in the world it feels like

4393
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:09,840
there's a lot of

4394
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:12,800
um solution space that gets opened up

4395
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,760
with this

4396
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,399
and in in introducing it in in

4397
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,240
digestible chunks

4398
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,760
so i always talk to my clients about

4399
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,840
where are you now where do you want to

4400
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,080
be that's a tough one and now i see why

4401
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,120
it's a tough one because it's

4402
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:28,479
in a way the wrong question

4403
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:30,800
where do you where do we want to be

4404
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:31,920
individually and then how do we

4405
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,800
synthesize

4406
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:34,720
and then what are the ways to get there

4407
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:36,240
and then you triage them

4408
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:38,080
so that's a standard thing i used to use

4409
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:42,319
now that's changing because it's a

4410
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:44,319
the exploration of where we want to be

4411
02:23:44,319 --> 02:23:46,240
is the answer to that really hard second

4412
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:47,439
question which is

4413
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:48,880
people have difficulty answering so

4414
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:51,280
thank you for inviting me on the journey

4415
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,640
this is great stuff

4416
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:56,240
so to close um on that um

4417
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:59,680
scott you just you laid out a helpful

4418
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:01,520
way of thinking about it with just where

4419
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,200
do you want to go this is common goal

4420
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:04,720
setting who are we where do we want to

4421
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:05,280
go

4422
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,359
how are we going to get there but you

4423
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:08,560
brought in two pieces which is the

4424
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,760
values

4425
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:12,399
the values are what is not explicitly

4426
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:13,840
described but they're part of the

4427
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,280
preference and the policy

4428
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,760
and so combining all of these disparate

4429
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,120
threads together

4430
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,800
and not having one heat engine for the

4431
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,560
refrigerator and one power plant for the

4432
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:23,359
other one

4433
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,120
but combining all of these threads

4434
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,720
together so we can have a discussion

4435
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:29,200
from multi-perspective so that's the

4436
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:30,880
intercultural component

4437
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:33,359
multi-perspective but also bringing

4438
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:34,160
together

4439
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:35,920
these co-excellent values that we have

4440
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:37,359
for system function

4441
02:24:37,359 --> 02:24:40,800
exploration so many other features but

4442
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,479
really um my closing

4443
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:45,600
thought is for this live stream that

4444
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:48,640
uh tomorrow probably i'm gonna record a

4445
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,720
video called 12.0 that is going to be

4446
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,319
the clock striking midnight

4447
02:24:52,319 --> 02:24:56,080
on 2020 and then we will indeed head

4448
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,319
into a very exciting 2021

4449
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:01,600
and beyond so uh both of you

4450
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:03,520
uh well actually all of you i guess are

4451
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:06,640
uh rsvp'd for the active inference lab

4452
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:07,920
so i'm just really looking forward to

4453
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:10,319
those three projects

4454
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:11,520
and just like you said scott with the

4455
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,600
digestible bits live

4456
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:16,880
livestream has been our learning process

4457
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:18,560
we've all learned so much along

4458
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,720
this journey but now we also want to be

4459
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,479
thinking about could make shorter

4460
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:25,680
content ones that have interactive parts

4461
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,920
who knows but there's going to be yeah

4462
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,120
great things

4463
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,840
happening ahead so thanks everyone who's

4464
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,720
listening live

4465
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:36,840
or in replay thanks guys for

4466
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:39,200
participating fantastic and and happy

4467
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:42,000
new year to everybody

4468
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:48,560
wow what a discussion what a discussion

4469
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,640
all right well i'm going to terminate

4470
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:51,680
the live stream

4471
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:54,240
so thanks everyone and i will talk to

4472
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,880
you later
