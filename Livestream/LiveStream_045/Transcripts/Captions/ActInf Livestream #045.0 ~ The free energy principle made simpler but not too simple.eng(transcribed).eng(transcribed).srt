hello everyone it is active live live

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,720
stream number 45.0

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
it's may 27 2022 and we're discussing

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,559
the paper the free energy principle made

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,079
simpler but not too simple

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
welcome to the actin flap we're a

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,399
participatory online lab that is

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
communicating learning and practicing

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
applied active inference you can find us

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
at the links on this slide

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,600
this is a recorded in an archive live

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
stream so please provide us with

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
feedback so we can improve our work

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,719
welcome and we'll be following video

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,040
etiquette for live streams

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
if you want to learn more about the live

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
streams or any of the other projects to

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
get involved at activelab head over to

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
activeinference.org

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
we're in stream number 45.0

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
our goal is to learn and discuss this

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
very interesting paper the free energy

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
principle made simpler but not too

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,000

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
and just like with all the dot zero

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
videos and indeed all the videos this is

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,479
an introduction and an overview to a

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,759
quite technical and

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
lengthy ish paper it's not a review or a

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,240
final word this is like the opening

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
context for some of the coming

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
discussions we're going to have in the

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
following weeks and beyond

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
and we're going to

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
first just say hello introduce the big

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
question the ames claims abstract and

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,038
roadmap

44
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
then we're going to give an overview of

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,200
some of the keywords that are in the

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
paper

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,239
then we're going to go through the

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,720
sections of the paper with a focus on

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
some of the key points the formalisms

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
and the figures especially

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
so it should be a great discussion

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,680
and

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
let's get into it we'll start with just

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
an introduction and saying hello so i'm

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
daniel i'm a researcher in california

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
and el paso brock brock thanks for

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
joining and for all the contributions in

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,280
this dot zero

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
yeah so exciting to be here and

60
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
participate in the academic lab and

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,000
um

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
yeah just really drawn to this topic and

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
this paper is a great starting point for

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
that it's really

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
got a lot of um

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,879
you know detail

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,840
uh that uh to dig into and

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
a lot to learn so

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,400
yeah

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
okay

71
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
so

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
one of the big questions or one way to

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
state the big question

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
was

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
what are

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,519
the foundations of the free energy

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,640
principle

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
and what does it contribute

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
in the paper they write that they start

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
from a description of the world in terms

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
of a random dynamical system systems

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
changing through time

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,159
and end up with a description of

84
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,480
self-organization as sentient sensing

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
active behavior and that's active

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,519
inference so

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
that's the question that we're wondering

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
about we're all wondering about what is

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
the basis

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,159
and the essence and the implications of

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
the free energy principle

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
what would you say about that or what

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,159
were some big questions that you had

94
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,000
coming into and out of this paper

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
my biggest question around like the free

96
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,519
energy principle is kind of it's it's

97
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
general how general is it where is it

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
and then

99
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,640
because it seems so

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
they say in the paper also it's like

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
it's pretty simple so kind of

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
tautological in some sense um

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,959
uh

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,238
so

105
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
yeah that's

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
one of my questions

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,639
you know where does it begin where does

108
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
it end and um

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
like how general is it the other

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,250
question is um

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,560
[Music]

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
yeah how

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
how does it uh

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
emerge or um

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
what does it look like at different

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
scales

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
awesome so we'll be returning to

118
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
questions again and again

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
let's check out the aims and the claims

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
of the paper

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
so again it's the free energy principle

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
made simpler but not too simple

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
and the authors are listed here

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,199
the

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
paper describes that it's trying to

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
present the free energy principle as

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
simply as possible but without

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,240
sacrificing too much technical detail

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
and that's sort of a pun slash

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
self-reference being that's what

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,560
modeling in that pareto optimal or bayes

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
optimal way is and that's gonna come

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
back as a theme again and again giving

134
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
information but not over fitting nor

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
underfitting

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,440
and then several claims that they make

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
are that they're going to step through

138
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
the formal arguments

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
that lead from the description of a

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
world as a random dynamical system

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
to the description of self-organization

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
in terms of active inference and

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
self-evidencing

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,479
they're going to discuss bayesian

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,840
mechanics

146
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,720
and

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
how those bayesian mechanics have the

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,199
same starting point as quantum

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
statistical and classical mechanics

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
and then they're going to differentiate

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
this bayesian mechanics for particular

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,199
systems from some of these previously

153
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,880
mentioned mechanics

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
in that

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
careful attention is paid to the way

156
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
that the internal states of something

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,919
couple to its external states

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
some of the aims and claims although

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
many more will be

160
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
introduced and are discussed in the

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
paper

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,359
any thoughts on that

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
or if you'd like to oh yeah god

164
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,600
yeah um

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
just um

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
well i mean that uh

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
essentially that it's you know it's just

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
self-evidencing

169
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,840
self-describing system

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
um

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
again just very it seems

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
to fit with a lot of uh

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
different domains and a lot of like just

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
observed experience

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
so

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,479
cool would you like to

177
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,359
read the abstract

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
sure

179
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
this paper provides a concise

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
description of the free energy principle

181
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,880
starting from a formulation of random

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,160
dynamical systems in terms of a

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
legovin equation and ending with a

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
bayesian mechanics that can be

185
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
read as a physics

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
of sentience

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
it rehearses the key

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
steps using standard results from

189
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
statistical physics

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
these steps entail

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,919
by establishing a particular partition

192
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,319
of states based on

193
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
conditional independencies inherent from

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,960
sparsely coupled dynamics to unpacking

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
the implications of

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,639
this partition

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
in terms of bayesian inference and three

198
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
describing the paths of particular

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,199
states with

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,000
a variational principle of least action

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
teleologically the free energy principle

202
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,080
offers a normative account of

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
self-organization in terms of optimal

204
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,319
bayesian design and decision making

205
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
in the sense of maximizing marginal

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
likelihood or

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
bayesian model evidence

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
in summary starting from a description

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,120
of the world in terms of random

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
dynamical systems we end up with a

211
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
description of self-organization

212
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
essential behavior that can be

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,400
interpreted as self-evidencing namely

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
self-assembly out of places or

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
active inference

216
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,560
awesome okay

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
let's go to the road map

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
so this paper has

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,240
layout and it'll be awesome to hear from

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
the authors about why they've laid it

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
out as well as numerous other details so

222
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,399
we're looking forward to those

223
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
discussions

224
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
in section one

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,519
is an introduction

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,720
and they wrote

227
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
at the end of the introduction the

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
remaining sections describe the free

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
energy principle each section that's two

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,839
through eight

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
focuses on an equation or sections

232
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
the ensuing narrative is meant to be

233
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,480
concise

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
taking us from the beginning to the end

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,519
as succinctly as possible

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
to avoid disrupting the narrative we use

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
footnotes to address questions that are

238
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
commonly asked at each step

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,600
we also use figure legends captions to

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
supplement the narrative with examples

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
from neurobiology

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,880
so there's a main narrative thread

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
that's going to touch on sections two

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
through eight each of these being like a

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
single or a cluster of formalisms

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
and then especially in the footnotes

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
which are formulated as questions and in

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
the figure captions which are

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
sometimes quite lengthy and include

250
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,720
examples and citations and so on

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,680
more of the biological details and

252
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
inspiration are added but the main line

253
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,880
narrative

254
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
is going to be touching on these

255
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
formal areas

256
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
systems states and fluctuates steady

257
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
states and non-equilibrium three

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,480
particles partitions and things in four

259
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,000
self-organization to self-evidencing in

260
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
five

261
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
lagrangian generalized states in

262
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
bayesian filtering and six

263
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,079
statistical to classical particles in

264
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,120
seven

265
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,279
path integrals planning and curious

266
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
particles in eight and section nine will

267
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
be a conclusion

268
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
so we're going to

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
next discuss the keywords

270
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
at an overview level and just describe

271
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
like some of the

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
broader topics that might lead someone

273
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,160
to find this paper be curious about it

274
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
or want to cite it in one of those

275
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,959
domains

276
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,720
and then we're going to just jump right

277
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
into the introduction each of the nine

278
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,519
sections will be clearly indicated which

279
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
section we're in and we'll be following

280
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,839
the order of the paper

281
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,200
bringing in a few other resources as

282
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
we saw fit in the preparation

283
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
and we're just gonna

284
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,519
focus on

285
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
some of the dots

286
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,839
connecting a few and leaving many many

287
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,440
for the dot one and the dot two

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
discussions

289
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,360
because it's again a paper with a lot of

290
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
formalisms

291
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
and a lot of rich

292
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
topics so we're just going to give this

293
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,399
overview

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,600
and try to

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
front load the contextualization

296
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
and then continue to unpack and develop

297
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
this and work on our shared

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,640
understanding in the coming weeks

299
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
the keywords that were listed were

300
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
bayesian

301
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,959
non-equilibrium

302
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
self-organization

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
variational inference

304
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
and markov blanket

305
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,440
so

306
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
brock

307
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
tell us about bayesian

308
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,440
bayesian analysis um

309
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
so it's

310
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
basically a

311
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,680
um

312
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,639
yeah it's an analysis method for

313
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,680
um

314
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
determining the

315
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
posterior probability which is

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
um

317
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
basically your

318
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
in inactive inference and

319
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
it's

320
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
going to be something like

321
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
your beliefs

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
after

323
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,440
having evidence added to

324
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
your prior beliefs which

325
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
are

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,360
something approximately like a

327
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,040
hypothesis

328
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,920
um

329
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,839
so i have the equation here

330
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,560
and

331
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
also the word explanation that's

332
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
essentially what i just said um

333
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
so you're adding you know observation to

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
hypothesis and changing um

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,839
trying to reduce

336
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,600
the um

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,079
trying to approximate the

338
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,440
uh

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
this phv here uh over e the processor

340
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
probability so

341
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
um

342
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
is

343
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,519
pretty foundational too

344
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
yeah a lot of statistics and physics and

345
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
other things

346
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,199
um

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
thank you yes totally agreed bayesian

348
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
statistics it's a big topic

349
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
and just like you said it's about how

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
prior beliefs meet incoming evidence and

351
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
how that is updated to form posterior

352
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
you know after the evidence beliefs

353
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
versus before the evidence and that can

354
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
be done in this continuous cycle

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
and a lot of the variables that we're

356
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,959
going to be seeing and talking about

357
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,839
have

358
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,959
interpretations of being one of these

359
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,800
for example it might be a variable that

360
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,399
represents a system's prior about

361
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,800
something or something might come in and

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,920
that might be

363
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
evidence so

364
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
we're going to be working within a

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
bayesian statistical framework

366
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
rather than for example a frequentist

367
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
p-value-driven statistical framework but

368
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
we'll come to these details along the

369
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,199
way

370
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,000
how about non-equilibrium

371
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,959
this is um

372
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
i think a

373
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
much fuzzier

374
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,519
topic um

375
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
like the tradition like historically

376
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,720
you know science studied like

377
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
equilibrium state systems and

378
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
non-equilibrium state systems are like

379
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,399
more uh

380
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,839
relatively newer things

381
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um and so

382
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
non-equilibrium is is um

383
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,639
these are things that were mentioned in

384
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,519
the papers like flows uh between

385
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,240
transitions of uh between like finite

386
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
sets of states having an attractor in a

387
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
system that over time

388
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,079
the you know

389
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
perturbations in the system um still

390
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,079
act as a set of characteristic states to

391
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,279
which the system is attracted over time

392
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,480
um

393
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
so

394
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
and non-equilibrium being like a higher

395
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
energy level state that is you know to

396
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,399
its local environment

397
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
um

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
but nonetheless

399
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
distinct definite separate

400
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
and overtime

401
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,439
continuous

402
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
so just looking at the animation you put

403
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
here it's like the brick

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,399
at some time scale

405
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
is out of equilibrium like the brick

406
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
will also dissolve but for some

407
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,639
model of a certain time frame hours it

408
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
could be seen as being spatially or just

409
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,199
materially in an equilibrium and then

410
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
looking at these two moving entities

411
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
it's kind of like two kinds of

412
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
non-equilibrium there's like the low bar

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,720
non-equilibrium this mechanical bird on

414
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,959
the right side the water dipper and so

415
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,279
it is returning to these characteristics

416
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,240
states

417
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
it's not just staying in one location

418
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
it's returning to drink the water again

419
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
and again so it's not in spatial

420
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
equilibrium

421
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
but also there's like this stationarity

422
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,519
or there's something about it that is

423
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,880
constrained

424
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
and then the um ostensibly living bird

425
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,600
i guess

426
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
the on the cartoon on the left

427
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
is like

428
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
non-equilibrium of an even

429
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,360
higher or more complex type because that

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
bird might like fly away or do something

431
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
else so there's like a gradient from

432
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
things that are like the ball at the

433
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,279
bottom of the bowl

434
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,880
in equilibrium

435
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
and then progressively mechanical

436
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
systems that are returning to attracting

437
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
states and then what does it mean for

438
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,279
biological systems to be or to be

439
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,839
modeled as returning to attracting

440
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
states like sleep or

441
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
a certain body temperature certain blood

442
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
glucose

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
any other thoughts on that or we can

444
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
carry on

445
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,559
yeah just yeah this is a different like

446
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,679
time scale set of states larger

447
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,839
smaller

448
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,799
and

449
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
uh

450
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
navigating traversing those states yeah

451
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
internally right and so

452
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
i guess it just it depends where you're

453
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,400
drawing the

454
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,799
the time scale

455
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,000
awesome but they can be modeled

456
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
differently like that right

457
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,960
how about

458
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,919
self-organization

459
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
i think this one like

460
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
um

461
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
maybe it sounds

462
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,919
uh just this complex but i think this is

463
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,600
like really familiar

464
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
for most people they have a good idea of

465
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
what this is

466
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,770
um

467
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,960
[Music]

468
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,679
and like yeah these like examples here

469
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,840
um

470
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,520
of uh non-equilibrium

471
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
systems um

472
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,880
that you know have some

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,400
um

474
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
symmetry asymmetry of constraints that

475
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,440
over time causes them to

476
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
take a particular path through that

477
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,480
um

478
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
set of states towards one attractor

479
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
or another

480
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,200
um

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
cellular meiosis and mitosis here um

482
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
black hole mergers

483
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
nuclear fission nuclear fusion

484
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
very large very small

485
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,320
meso in between scales here um

486
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,390
in the paper um

487
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,080
[Music]

488
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,960
referencing fep they were they said it

489
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,000
was fep was about kind of turning

490
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
on its head this traditional what what

491
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,320
must things do in order to exist

492
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,440
framing

493
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,559
of

494
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
systems and physics to

495
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,320
if if it exists

496
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
what must they do

497
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,679
and so

498
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
this is saying

499
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
you know we have now a bayesian

500
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
evidence of

501
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,039
black hole mergers

502
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,320
what must it be doing for that data

503
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,918
now that new evidence to

504
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
um

505
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
yeah exist like

506
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
what how

507
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
will

508
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
how does nuclear fusion you know how

509
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
does that turn into two atoms turning

510
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,600
into one atom what must it be do it

511
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,919
instead of

512
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,559
the other way around

513
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,799
awesome yeah big

514
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
topic many angles on it but sometimes

515
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
those inversions

516
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
like actual constants paper that we

517
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,600
discussed in live stream 34 with um

518
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
it's about how you got there

519
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
so

520
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,799
conditioned on some thing which we're

521
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
going to return to existing being

522
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
perceived being modeled

523
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
what must that thing be doing in order

524
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
to exist

525
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
not what has to happen for the thing to

526
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
exist but we're going to come back to

527
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,679
that

528
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039
and then um the last two will just give

529
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
a first

530
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
coat of paint because we're gonna see

531
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,600
them in their technical glory soon so

532
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,440
what is variational inference about

533
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,880
um i'm actually less

534
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
clear on this but

535
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,840
uh

536
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
related to bayesian inference it's about

537
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,440
approximating that um

538
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
posterior probability the

539
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
um after

540
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
um

541
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
things happen like but what

542
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
you know um

543
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,039
to what resolution can you kind of you

544
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,039
know what precision can you

545
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
state about that and also trying to have

546
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
a lower bound

547
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
for the marginal likelihood of evidence

548
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
of the observed data so how likely are

549
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
you to see

550
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,960
um

551
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,320
the data that would cause that to be

552
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
that would lead to the processor

553
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
probability being what it is

554
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
that was my understanding

555
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,600
of this

556
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
yeah awesome

557
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,039
what is the divergence um it'll be

558
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,200
awesome to hear the authors and others

559
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,880
perspectives but

560
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,640
places where we've seen variational

561
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
bayesian inference before first off it's

562
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,559
not an innovation of active inference

563
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
variational autoencoders and variational

564
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,679
bayesian methods are being used in

565
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
active inference

566
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,919
with

567
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,159
the partial novelty of action being

568
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,799
considered as a parameter rather than

569
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
just sensory parameters

570
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
but it's used in situations where exact

571
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,039
base

572
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,880
is intractable

573
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
and sampling based approaches like monte

574
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,039
carlo

575
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,159
are also

576
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,280
not tractable or not plausible and so

577
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,799
variational inference is about

578
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,200
minimizing the divergence between

579
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,880
q and p

580
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,120
mind your q's and p's as they say up

581
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,159
there

582
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,280
and

583
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,919
making sure that q is from a family of

584
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,799
distributions that is tractable and easy

585
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
to optimize even if p

586
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
is something that is challenging

587
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
instead a different distribution for

588
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
example one that has a shape looking

589
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,400
more like a parabola more like a bowl

590
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
can be fit with q

591
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
and then there's still some detail like

592
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,440
if p truly were bimodal

593
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
would you want the one that identifies

594
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
and rests q on top of one hump and

595
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,919
ignores the other hump

596
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,960
or would you want the cue that is kind

597
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
of centered at a place where neither of

598
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
the p humps are

599
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,640
but contains some density in both so

600
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
those are some detailed questions but in

601
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
general it's about minimizing the

602
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
divergence between q and p

603
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,799
as a means of approximating

604
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,760
what

605
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,919
exact base would be doing in the

606
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,799
asymptote if the divergence were zero

607
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
you would be

608
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
having the perfect approximation of q on

609
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,840
p

610
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
and then anywhere other than the

611
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
divergence being zero

612
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
there's a monotonic way for you to get

613
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
towards that

614
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,280
and then

615
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,360
markov blanket which we're gonna come to

616
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,919
in multiple formalisms but just

617
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,720
what

618
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
comes to mind when you hear markov

619
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,200
blanket and what did you want to show

620
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
here

621
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
everything this one is like i feel like

622
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
this is the most

623
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,600
easy to understand one somehow it's um

624
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
like this picture here

625
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
you can see is a bunch of dots that are

626
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,640
different colors right and you have um

627
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
like a circular concentric circles here

628
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,039
um

629
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,919
and that's you know to at this large

630
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
inside the large square scale

631
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,679
there's this like yellow

632
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,000
line that separates

633
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,919
all the outside dark blue from the

634
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,039
inside orange and red

635
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,120
and

636
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,080
but there's also an an orange inside

637
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,120
circle

638
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
and these these yellow and orange

639
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,080
are kind of in a

640
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,720
um

641
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
in a relationship that

642
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,640
keeps the dark blue and the red separate

643
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,000
independent of each other

644
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,840
but you also have

645
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,360
these obviously these

646
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
smaller scale inside the red inside the

647
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,679
yellow inside the orange here

648
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
right these other scale of the same

649
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
thing like that it is

650
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,080
um

651
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
in some sense either

652
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
recursive or fractal or

653
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
um you know locally

654
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,799
having this same kind of dynamic of two

655
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,400
layers

656
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,520
um conditioned on each other to keep

657
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
an external

658
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,320
um

659
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,440
and an internal state independent of

660
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
each other

661
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
um

662
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,720
awesome yes which is everything i feel

663
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
like

664
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,720
it's every

665
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,919
thing

666
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,360
which we're going to be getting to

667
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
mind the space

668
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,950
and um

669
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,760
[Music]

670
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
it's an exciting topic and there's a lot

671
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,559
of ongoing discussions and developments

672
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
here's a recent paper by casper hesp and

673
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,039
there's many other valuable commentaries

674
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,120
on emperor's new markov blankets by

675
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,559
yella brundenberg

676
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,559
which was previously on a live stream so

677
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
there's many many technical and

678
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
philosophical and implementation

679
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
discussions around identifying markov

680
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
blankets reifying them

681
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,240
and so on

682
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,159
and we're gonna get there so

683
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,720
into the paper we go

684
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
we're in section one

685
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
introduction

686
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
they write

687
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
um it is said

688
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
that the free energy principle is

689
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,080
difficult to understand no citation

690
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,559
who's saying that no one is saying that

691
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,520
this is ironic on three counts first the

692
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,919
fep is so simple that it is almost

693
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,520
taught logical

694
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
circular reasoning

695
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
indeed philosophical accounts compare

696
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,960
its explanandam

697
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
what it explains to a desert landscape

698
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,279
in the sense of quine aquinian desert

699
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,400
landscape

700
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
as per what clark wrote and we'll return

701
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
to that in a second

702
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,159
a second reason for the irony

703
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:50,880
is

704
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
a tenant of the fep is that everything

705
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,120
must provide an accurate account of

706
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
things that is as simple as possible

707
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
including itself

708
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,400
finally the fep rests on straightforward

709
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
results from statistical physics so one

710
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,400
is

711
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
it's not difficult to understand it's so

712
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
simple it's circular

713
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,520
two is how can it be difficult to

714
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,799
understand

715
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,200
when everything is as simple as it must

716
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
be including the fep literature

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
that's that's some high level irony and

718
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,760
then the third reason is

719
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
how could it be difficult to understand

720
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
when it rests on straightforward results

721
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,000
from statistical physics and then i just

722
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
wanted to highlight this clark 2013

723
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,360
citation and the desert landscape

724
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
because that seems like kind of like an

725
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
oblique reference

726
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
but here's what clark and also here's

727
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,679
two representations of desert landscapes

728
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,480
so they're not all bad in fact but what

729
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,360
clark wrote was

730
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
referring to radicalisms that might

731
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,679
exist within this framework

732
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,679
in extending the models to include

733
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,640
action

734
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
action-oriented predictive processing

735
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
which is very very similar to active

736
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
inference

737
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,399
we might simultaneously do away with the

738
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,520
need to appeal to goals and rewards

739
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,440
replacing them with a more austere

740
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,600
construct of predictions

741
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,760
so i don't want

742
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
to do this or i'm not rewarded by doing

743
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
that i'm just making predictions and

744
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
expectations about what might happen and

745
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
then fulfilling them or diverging from

746
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,760
those fulfillments

747
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,360
and so um

748
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
that is this desert landscape vision

749
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,120
there are neither goals nor reward

750
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,200
signals as such

751
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
instead there are only learnt and

752
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
species specific so kind of

753
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
developmental and evolutionary

754
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
expectations across spatial and temporal

755
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,200
scales that are in control of perception

756
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,880
action loops

757
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,399
and so

758
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,399
what are we explaining or explaining

759
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,399
away that's this desert landscape notion

760
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,720
and that's how the authors are beginning

761
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
the paper with a sort of preemptive

762
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,640
tripartite broadside

763
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,760
dissuading one from thinking that this

764
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,159
is going to be difficult to understand

765
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,159
before launching into the subsequent

766
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,559
eight sections that might give you some

767
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,360
um

768
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
evidence to the contrary but yeah any

769
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,960
thoughts on that

770
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,880
i just thought yeah the desert liquidium

771
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,840
desert landscape very apt description

772
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,440
and um

773
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,880
yeah physical

774
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
sort of yep

775
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
it lines up and

776
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,799
yeah like i said that this uh

777
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,440
it does seem tautological like a lot of

778
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,120
these concepts if you think about them

779
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
from like the statistical physics it's

780
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
like

781
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,799
obviously but um

782
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,120
then there's just a lot of

783
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
area there to be covered right

784
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,880
so yes and also note that clark in 2013

785
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
wrote i remain unconvinced even if the

786
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,679
austere description is possible this

787
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,080
would not justify the claim that this is

788
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,320
the better tool for understanding the

789
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,960
cognitive economy so

790
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,399
it's it is intractable so it's like yeah

791
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,080
what yeah

792
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,000
yep awesome

793
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,120
so

794
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
still in the introduction

795
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
the author is right before starting it

796
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
might help to clarify what the free

797
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
energy principle is and why it is big

798
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
question alert

799
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,919
many theories in the biological sciences

800
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,080
are answers to the question what must

801
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
things do in order to exist

802
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,279
and some answers but we could think of

803
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,720
probably many others that people have

804
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,120
raised so if if you ask somebody what

805
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,720
does something have to do in order to

806
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,880
exist some answers could be like well it

807
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
has to resist dissipation it has to

808
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,440
replicate or it has to reproduce or

809
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
propagate some way like there's stuff it

810
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,120
has to do

811
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,799
to be there

812
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
the fep turns this question on its head

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,159
and asks

814
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,399
if things exist what must they do

815
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,320
more formally if we can define what it

816
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,640
means to be something

817
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,880
can we identify the physics or dynamics

818
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,519
that that thing must possess

819
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,600
to answer this question the fep calls on

820
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,519
some mathematical truisms that follow

821
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
from each other

822
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,039
then they write

823
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,120
much like hamilton's principle of least

824
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
action the fep is not a falsifiable

825
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,200
theory about the way things behave

826
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,960
it is a description

827
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
of things that are defined in a

828
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
particular way

829
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,080
and for

830
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,200
more reading on this here's a 2018

831
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,840
interview with fortier and myself and

832
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,519
with carl firsten

833
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,480
and here there's some discussion

834
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,320
around

835
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
notions of false of ability can the fep

836
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
be falsified or what is the relevance of

837
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
falsification

838
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,880
which is a frequentist idea

839
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
in this bayesian metabasian post

840
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,399
bayesian whatever

841
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
epoch or mode that we're in and just one

842
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,960
really interesting quote is um

843
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,039
from carl i would assert that the notion

844
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,960
that a framework can have the attribute

845
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,720
falsifiable is a category error

846
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
the notion of falsifibility is thus a

847
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
very weak notion

848
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
because it's actually reflecting

849
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,120
rejecting a null hypothesis in favor of

850
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,399
an alternative hypothesis

851
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
that has some limitations

852
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,760
um

853
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
including the sort of

854
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
uh the transcendental argument on

855
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,840
falsification which is just that

856
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
belief is rarely scrutinized using a

857
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,799
falsificationist framework

858
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,919
and then dropping from the

859
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,679
transcendental argument into a more

860
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,880
history of statistics and science

861
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
when we move from frequentism towards

862
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,080
bayesian statistics

863
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,480
where the p-value and so on and the

864
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
parametric distributions are seen as

865
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,039
like special cases but not the whole

866
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,600
substance of the statistics

867
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
carl's suggesting that a better way to

868
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,039
frame evidence-based selection of

869
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
hypotheses

870
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,039
which is ostensibly what falsification

871
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,200
is after as well

872
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
is in terms of how much empirical

873
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,840
evidence is accrued by competing

874
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,039
hypotheses and that's quite a different

875
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,760
model than uh can and then falsify the

876
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
ones that aren't true let's shoot down

877
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,399
the ones that don't exist so this is

878
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,080
quite an interesting area

879
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,039
um

880
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,559
what would you say or add to this

881
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,640
there's a word uh varus militude

882
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
i think that is

883
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,120
exactly what he's um describing here

884
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,240
again

885
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,519
just

886
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,919
how much evidence is accrued rather than

887
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,640
yeah i mean

888
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,279
that's in practice how it works

889
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,919
so i don't completely understand the

890
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,080
notion of phosphate valuability is it's

891
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,840
really important

892
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
but

893
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,560
um like like derock um had this notion

894
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
of beauty or

895
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
and he's saying look if the equation is

896
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
really beautiful

897
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,639
then

898
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,520
maybe you check your experiment first

899
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,639
um

900
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,599
so

901
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,440
like you were saying it's kind of like

902
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,960
um that's not falsifiable but

903
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
then what do you mean by not falsifiable

904
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,879
and that is that you're not examining

905
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,359
that claim it's kind of there's a

906
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,199
you know infinite regression there of

907
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,639
falsifiability

908
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,760
that makes it intractable which is why

909
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,199
taking the opposite approach of just

910
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,359
stacking up the evidence

911
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,159
is

912
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,760
you know a way to make the sa it's the

913
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,879
same thing

914
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,040
you know but a tractable version kind of

915
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,159
of it right so

916
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,639
awesome

917
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,599
they're right

918
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,760
again picking up on that last quotation

919
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,160
there that the fep is not a falsifiable

920
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,320
theory about the way things behave

921
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,480
it's a description of things that are

922
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,040
defined in a particular way

923
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,440
let's talk about utility is such a

924
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,800
description

925
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,520
if the fep is indeed a description is it

926
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,640
useful

927
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
in itself the answer is probably no oh

928
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
well then we can stop reading

929
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
in the sense that the principle of least

930
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
action does not tell you how to throw a

931
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
ball

932
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,640
however the principle of least action

933
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,800
furnishes everything we need to know to

934
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,440
simulate the trajectory of a ball in a

935
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
particular

936
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,800
instance

937
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
in the same sense

938
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,320
the fep allows one to simulate and

939
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
predict the sentient behavior of a

940
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,240
particle person artifact or agent i.e

941
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,119
some

942
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,560
thing

943
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
this allows one to build sentient

944
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,640
artifacts or use simulations as

945
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,680
observation models of particles or of

946
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,919
those other mentioned types of systems

947
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
these simulations rest upon specifying a

948
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,480
generative model

949
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
that is apt to describe the behavior of

950
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,839
the particle or person at hand

951
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,680
at this point

952
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,520
committing to a specific generative

953
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,079
model can be taken as a commitment to a

954
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
specific and falsifiable theory

955
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
later we will see examples of these

956
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
simulations

957
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,760
so it's like

958
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,640
the linear regression concept

959
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
is not even where you would want to

960
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,200
focus the brunt of your falsifying

961
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,240
effort

962
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,119
but

963
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
if there are

964
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,200
two different linear aggression models

965
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,599
we might ask which one is preferable or

966
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,920
which one is falsified by doing some

967
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,720
subsequent perturbation or experiments

968
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,599
but the linear regression framework

969
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,920
is like a framework hence not

970
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,079
falsifiable in the way that people often

971
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,119
expect

972
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,839
and deploying a specific generative

973
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,960
model

974
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
analogous to like a specific linear

975
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,599
aggression model but different

976
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,320
that is where there's a commitment to a

977
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,480
falsifiable theory well i think the

978
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,160
amygdala connects to this that way

979
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,560
that could be tested and that evidence

980
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,920
could be evaluated within a

981
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,200
falsification or bayesian base factor

982
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,759
framework

983
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
falsifying the concept of generative

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,000
models

985
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,200
they would be have crossed that bridge

986
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
and now could be engaging in

987
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
falsification and evidence comparison

988
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,800
within

989
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
some constrained space

990
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,839
anything to add on that as we close the

991
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,160
introduction

992
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,400
yeah just again wait this is a linear

993
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,280
model versus a general model like

994
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
the linear model will yield some

995
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,760
approximation that's not a necessarily a

996
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
real

997
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,350
um

998
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,280
[Music]

999
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,720
possible observation to falsify

1000
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,640
the generative model

1001
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
will produce many

1002
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,000
things that you might not observe

1003
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,599
possibly but um some that you will and

1004
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,560
then could potentially be falsified

1005
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
like it gives specific examples so

1006
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,440
yes it's almost like it takes this this

1007
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,200
miso scale

1008
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
and it it

1009
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,280
separates the the milk from the cream

1010
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,680
and the fep

1011
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,640
flies over falsification

1012
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,079
and then once you're committed to a

1013
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,079
specific generative model it's actually

1014
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,240
written down not just speculated that it

1015
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,480
could be written down then it's like oh

1016
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,960
well then it's trivial or against it so

1017
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
it kind of separated out the framework

1018
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,599
like language as a framework like dave

1019
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
just mentioned in the chat how would you

1020
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,119
falsify a language you would not any

1021
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,960
more than you would falsify a conceptual

1022
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
framework so

1023
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,359
one could not falsify

1024
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,079
a language like english

1025
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,359
but things that are said within english

1026
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
might be amenable to being tested once

1027
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,000
they're actually said using that

1028
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
framework

1029
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
very interesting evidence stacked up or

1030
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
not versus alternatives

1031
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,760
just like

1032
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,280
language or

1033
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
evolution awesome

1034
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,960
so recall the roadmap

1035
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
we're now going to head into the next

1036
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
sections each of which is going to be

1037
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,520
building on each other in this concise

1038
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
narrative

1039
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
however also

1040
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
semi stand alone

1041
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
in their focus

1042
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,079
and we're just going to do basically a

1043
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,880
first pass and some contextualization

1044
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,119
because we have a lot of time in the

1045
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,760
coming weeks to discuss these topics in

1046
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
more detail

1047
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,839
so we're going to go to section two

1048
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,040
systems

1049
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,160
states and fluctuations

1050
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,040
okay

1051
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
so they write

1052
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,800
we start by describing the world with

1053
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,359
the stochastic differential equation

1054
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
pavliotis 2014.

1055
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,079
so this is um a citation to the book

1056
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,320
stochastic processes and applications of

1057
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
diffusions processes

1058
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,359
um

1059
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,960
and

1060
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,640
uh

1061
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
just one preliminary note this is not

1062
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,599
the same sentence as the world is a

1063
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,319
stochastic differential equation

1064
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,400
we start by describing

1065
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,319
the world with a stochastic differential

1066
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,319
equation so

1067
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,560
leave your realism at the door we're

1068
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,680
describing models here

1069
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
they write why start here

1070
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,680
the principal reason is that we want a

1071
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,359
description that is consistent with

1072
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,800
physics

1073
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
here's some discussion questions what

1074
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
does it mean to be consistent with

1075
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,760
physics

1076
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,520
what does it mean to be consistent with

1077
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,240
physics in theory or in principle or in

1078
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,760
practice

1079
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
and then they write

1080
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
this follows because things like the

1081
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
schrodinger equation in quantum

1082
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,720
mechanics

1083
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,079
area a

1084
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,240
fluctuation theorems in statistical

1085
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,680
mechanics

1086
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,200
area b

1087
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,440
and lagrangian formulation of classical

1088
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,800
mechanics

1089
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,319
area c

1090
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,480
three different mechanics

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,440
quantum statistical and classical

1092
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
can all be derived from this starting

1093
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,040
point

1094
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
so we're going back to like the last

1095
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
common ancestor of those three different

1096
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,760
mechanics

1097
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
and then that is where bayesian

1098
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,400
mechanics is going to also be initiated

1099
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
from

1100
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,880
in short if one wants a physics of

1101
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,839
sentience this is the place to start

1102
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,440
why start where

1103
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,880
where are we going

1104
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,079
why are we going

1105
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,040
anything you want to add here

1106
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
um

1107
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,119
no i think again just that yeah that

1108
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,319
that's all these scare physics it's it's

1109
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,160
odd that you would

1110
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,000
be able to reproduce

1111
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
you know derive all these things from

1112
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
something

1113
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
that's not

1114
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,680
fundamental or

1115
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,599
important in some way

1116
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,839
so

1117
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,040
awesome

1118
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,560
they write

1119
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,319
we are interested in systems that have

1120
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,480
characteristic states this means the

1121
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
system has a pullback attractor

1122
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,119
the sets of states that the system will

1123
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,079
come to occupy from any initial state so

1124
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,920
the rubber band is going to pull back to

1125
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,200
its resting

1126
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,000
state if it's allowed to

1127
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and formalism

1128
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,480
that stochastic differential equation

1129
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
describing the rate of change of the

1130
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,280
states so x are the states the tau is

1131
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,599
the time and the dot notation is the

1132
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,520
derivative with respect to time

1133
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,560
so how states are changing

1134
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,440
is

1135
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
equal to

1136
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,240
their flow f of x f for flow

1137
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,119
and

1138
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,839
random fluctuations omega

1139
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,040
so like a signal and a noise term

1140
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,839
there's the the flow the ocean current

1141
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,240
and then there's the vibration that

1142
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,880
isn't the directed flow

1143
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,839
and this

1144
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,119
separation

1145
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,359
of scales is going to come back again

1146
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,480
and again

1147
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,200
so

1148
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,599
dot notation again means the derivative

1149
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,400
with respect to time so how things are

1150
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,160
changing with respect to time

1151
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,319
through time

1152
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,839
this

1153
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,200
yellow

1154
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,359
means that time and causality are baked

1155
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,440
into everything that follows in the

1156
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,280
sense that states cause their motion

1157
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,160
this equation is itself an approximation

1158
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,400
to a simpler mapping from some variables

1159
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,000
to changes in those variables with time

1160
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,599
this follows from a separation into

1161
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,319
states and random fluctuations implicit

1162
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,960
in formalism one where states change

1163
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,400
slowly in relation to fast fluctuations

1164
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
so if

1165
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,960
this term the noise term is dominant

1166
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,640
then

1167
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,800
there will not be movements

1168
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,000
flow like movement on a manifold

1169
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,260
um

1170
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,640
[Music]

1171
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
there's some more details but

1172
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,240
things are changing in different ways

1173
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,280
different kind of stochastic equations

1174
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,520
that are going to be presented here and

1175
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,680
in the book in the citations

1176
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,240
they help us see different parts of how

1177
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,280
we can use dynamical models

1178
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,720
to understand

1179
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
physics and specifically the physics of

1180
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,240
particular cognitive sentient systems

1181
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,480
then in the footnote they ask a question

1182
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,440
why is the flow not a function of time

1183
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,359
and that's what we're going to return to

1184
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,040
in dot one

1185
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,359
how is time dealt with

1186
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,520
or not dealt with similarly or

1187
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,640
differently than other frameworks or

1188
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,359
other physics

1189
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,079
and then just to stay on this formalism

1190
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,359
one and then

1191
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,440
please give any other thoughts

1192
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,800
this last line of one p of x equals

1193
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,599
question mark

1194
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,880
the next step

1195
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,079
shared by all physics so those three

1196
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,079
areas that we described

1197
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,160
classical statistical quantum and

1198
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,440
bayesian

1199
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
is to ask whether anything can be said

1200
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
about the probability density over the

1201
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,640
states the question mark in one

1202
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
so this is the common grounding

1203
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,359
this is the last common ancestor of the

1204
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,960
multiple physics

1205
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,720
and now we're going to take it in a

1206
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
different direction

1207
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,480
a lot can be said about this probability

1208
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,560
density p of x

1209
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
which can be expressed in two

1210
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,599
complementary ways

1211
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,520
and this is going to introduce

1212
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,400
a

1213
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,880
very important distinction and dialectic

1214
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,800
here are the two complementary ways

1215
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
left side blue

1216
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,040
density dynamics using the focker planck

1217
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,079
equation

1218
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,839
aka also known as the forward klomogorov

1219
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,119
equation

1220
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,440
here's formalism too

1221
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,119
the focker planck equation describes the

1222
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,200
change in density due to random

1223
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,119
fluctuations and the flow of states

1224
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,560
through state space

1225
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,720
this is like a field

1226
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
model and then the second complementary

1227
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,240
way in orange on the right side

1228
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,640
in terms of the probability of a path

1229
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,560
through state space using the path

1230
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,640
integral formulation and they write for

1231
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,000
formalism three

1232
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,480
conversely the path integral formulation

1233
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,000
considers the probability of a

1234
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,440
trajectory

1235
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,960
or path in terms of its action

1236
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,400
so

1237
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,640
what are two things that you can say or

1238
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,440
more about the probability density

1239
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
what are two complementary ways that it

1240
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
can be expressed

1241
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,400
what are important similarities and

1242
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,599
differences

1243
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,040
between this focker planck formalism two

1244
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,480
approach

1245
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,520
and

1246
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,720
the

1247
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,599
path integral formulation of formalism

1248
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,720
three

1249
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,079
are there other

1250
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,319
complementary ways to say it or other

1251
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,160
ways to say what is here but this is

1252
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,000
just to introduce what's going to be

1253
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,319
very important and going to be moved

1254
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,400
back and forth in the course of this

1255
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359
paper which is one representation that's

1256
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,720
more field-like continuum-like

1257
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,480
and then another representation that's

1258
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,119
going to be more trajectory and

1259
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,640
path-based

1260
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,839
what do you see in there

1261
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,520
um yeah we

1262
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,040
we discussed this like really briefly

1263
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,640
about

1264
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,090
um

1265
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,640
[Music]

1266
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,520
you know like a continuous

1267
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,480
space versus a kind of discrete or

1268
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,520
instantaneous space like

1269
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,040
there's some

1270
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,200
um

1271
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,640
mostly i guess metaphor there analogy um

1272
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,319
but when you just ask this question of

1273
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,920
what are you know other ways to say this

1274
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,040
like it's it's um

1275
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,800
the action trajectory their uh path is

1276
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,200
like a

1277
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
sounds like like a like an action

1278
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,520
density or an energy density like where

1279
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,400
the where is the kind of um

1280
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,960
you know path of of the energy and the

1281
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,599
whole system gonna um

1282
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,680
you know invents itself right so it's

1283
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,440
it's like an action density gradient or

1284
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
something like this right

1285
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,839
um

1286
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,720
yeah

1287
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,520
cool

1288
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,920
real interesting

1289
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,839
both the are plank and the path

1290
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,599
integral formulations

1291
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,960
the the formalism 2 3 dialectic

1292
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,880
inherit their functional form from

1293
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,800
assumptions about the statistics of

1294
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,440
random fluctuations in one

1295
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,280
so recall one

1296
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,119
with the flow and the random fluctuation

1297
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,480
term

1298
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,359
for example the most likely path or path

1299
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,680
of least action

1300
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,079
is the path taken when the fluctuations

1301
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,960
take their most likely value of zero

1302
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,839
so

1303
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,800
we're gonna

1304
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,880
explore this more but the path of least

1305
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,160
action is not using action in the same

1306
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,040
way that active states are

1307
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,160
exactly

1308
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,079
path of least action does not mean the

1309
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,000
laziest or the least energetically

1310
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
costly or the least mobile thing to do

1311
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,839
it's not that it is so that is

1312
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,760
what we're going to explore

1313
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
what does it mean

1314
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,000
to minimize action

1315
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,480
in this framework

1316
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,520
the motion on the path of least action

1317
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,760
is just the flow without random

1318
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,440
fluctuations

1319
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,920
so if the question were you're trying to

1320
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,400
run in a straight line forward

1321
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
there's two forces there's the flow of

1322
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
you running forward and then there's

1323
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
your thermal vibrations

1324
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,400
so

1325
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,839
in one limit

1326
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,160
the flow might absolutely be

1327
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,000
overwhelming the random fluctuation of

1328
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,440
least action would be that person

1329
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,200
running forward

1330
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,440
conversely if that person was like the

1331
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,839
size of one

1332
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,400
molecule they would be being buffeted by

1333
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,680
stochastic

1334
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
thermal vibration

1335
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,760
and so they would not be following that

1336
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,839
path of least action the same way

1337
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,599
this metaphor hopefully doesn't

1338
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,960
misrepresent

1339
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,200
but paths of least action will figure

1340
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
prominently in the following sections of

1341
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,920
the paper

1342
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,839
especially when considering systems that

1343
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,040
behave in a precise or predictable way

1344
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,119
we will denote the most likely states

1345
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,880
and paths with a bold typeface so it can

1346
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,200
be a little subtle sometimes and so

1347
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,319
we'll try to um clarify notation and get

1348
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,880
assistance as we can but like this is

1349
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,400
like a bold x like a bold x through t

1350
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,520
is the minimization of that unbolded

1351
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,640
function

1352
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,040
with respect to the action a

1353
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,480
of those states through time

1354
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,720
and that is going to be related to the

1355
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,680
change

1356
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,400
in x through time being just only the

1357
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,599
flow

1358
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,240
so here it was like x dot of t

1359
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,880
equals the flow of x plus a noise term

1360
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,599
here if the noise term is zero

1361
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,400
you can drop it

1362
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,880
and then they write

1363
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,480
although equivalent

1364
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,720
the falk are plank and the path integral

1365
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,079
formalisms

1366
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,880
this dialectic that we've discussed the

1367
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,559
formalisms provide complementary

1368
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,960
perspectives on dynamics

1369
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,640
did we mention that they're different

1370
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,400
but complementary

1371
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,559
the former deals with time dependent

1372
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,880
probability densities over states

1373
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,240
the latter

1374
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,040
path integral considers time independent

1375
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,000
densities over paths

1376
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,920
the density overstates at a particular

1377
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,079
time is the time marginal of the density

1378
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,680
over trajectories

1379
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,680
these probabilities bayesian

1380
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,480
probabilities bayesian statistics

1381
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,400
can be conveniently quantified in terms

1382
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,720
of their negative logarithms or

1383
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,240
potentials

1384
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
leading to surprisal and action

1385
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,680
respectively

1386
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,400
so

1387
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,599
we'll

1388
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,920
explore the formalisms more but just to

1389
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,920
note that the fancy i the fracture i

1390
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,640
is the joint distribution

1391
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,960
and it is going to be

1392
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,559
a negative log

1393
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,880
on the joint distribution p

1394
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,880
and then similarly a the action

1395
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,000
is going to be on those same variables

1396
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,960
in a slightly different way

1397
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,839
being

1398
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,079
looking like a surprise

1399
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,800
conditioned upon x sub 0 the starting

1400
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,319
conditions

1401
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,960
and we're going to go into more

1402
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,720
detail in the coming weeks

1403
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,640
any more comments on section two or

1404
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,520
we'll continue to three

1405
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,240
no i yeah that's

1406
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,319
awesome

1407
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,480
section three solutions steady states

1408
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,640
and non-equilibrium

1409
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,079
so far so sections one and two

1410
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,160
we have equations that describe the

1411
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,000
relationship between the dynamics of a

1412
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,280
system

1413
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,119
and probability densities over

1414
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,599
fluctuations states and their paths

1415
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,920
this is sufficient to elaborate most

1416
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,000
physics

1417
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
big if true

1418
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,280
here's where the

1419
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,559
for example

1420
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,559
we could use the fock or plank or the

1421
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
path integral formalism so either side

1422
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,559
of that dialectic

1423
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,880
to derive quantum mechanics where the

1424
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
focker planck becomes the schrodinger

1425
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,559
wave equation

1426
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,880
mechanics one quantum

1427
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,119
we could focus on systems that comprise

1428
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,920
statistical ensembles of similar states

1429
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,079
to derive stochastic and statistical

1430
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
mechanics in terms of fluctuation

1431
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,640
theorems statistical mechanics mechanics

1432
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,000
number two

1433
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,160
finally we could consider large systems

1434
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,000
in which the fluctuations are averaged

1435
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,119
away

1436
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,520
to derive classical mechanics

1437
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,920
such as electromagnetism

1438
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,119
and

1439
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,520
dot general relativity classical

1440
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,800

1441
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,119
mechanics number three

1442
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,559
all of these mechanics quantum

1443
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,160
statistical

1444
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,000
classical acquire boundary conditions

1445
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,599
to give the examples

1446
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,280
the schrodinger potential in quantum

1447
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,559
mechanics

1448
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,400
the heat bath or reservoir in

1449
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,119
statistical mechanics and the classical

1450
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,680
potential for lagrangian

1451
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,760
classical mechanics

1452
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,280
at this point the fvp steps back

1453
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,280
i wonder what space it's in

1454
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,559
and asks

1455
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,720
where do these boundary conditions come

1456
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,079
from

1457
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,839
indeed this was implicit in

1458
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,400
schrodinger's question in the famous

1459
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,880
article what is life 1944

1460
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,640
where schroedinger wrote how can the

1461
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,200
events in space and time

1462
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,880
which take place within the spatial

1463
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,760
boundary of a living organism

1464
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,680
be accounted for by physics and

1465
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,119
chemistry

1466
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,599
and this is a bit of a um

1467
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,640
nod slash reference to the paper of

1468
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,200
ramstead at all in 2018

1469
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,960
answering schrodinger's question of free

1470
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,599
energy formulization formulation so this

1471
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,200
was a really

1472
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,640
impactful and relevant paper that

1473
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,160
started

1474
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,880
a discussion around the fep and

1475
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,440
multi-scale fep and self-organizing

1476
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,160
complex biological systems and so on

1477
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,680
so

1478
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,559
anything

1479
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,240
to add about these mechanics and their

1480
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,359
similarities and differences

1481
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,160
markup blankets

1482
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,040
i'll just leave it there

1483
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,319
they're everywhere

1484
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,520
uh in formalism six

1485
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,200
we're going to go into it hopefully in

1486
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,000
the discussions but just um in live

1487
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,040
stream number 32 on stochastic chaos and

1488
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,640
markov blankets

1489
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,040
just to show where these similar

1490
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,720
equations were

1491
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,079
represented

1492
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,839
we talked about how the helmholtz

1493
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,440
decomposition

1494
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,799
could be used

1495
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,319
to take a field

1496
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,520
and decompose it into

1497
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,760
multiple sections

1498
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,559
there's the divergence term

1499
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,359
which is like um or the gradient term

1500
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,200
which is like you're on some landscape

1501
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,599
and the ruler that's the most angled

1502
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,400
just going straight up the hill that's

1503
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,480
like the divergence term and that might

1504
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,720
be useful for going up or down a hill as

1505
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,119
fast as possible then there's this

1506
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,280
solenoidal or curl

1507
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,040
flow term

1508
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,160
and that is like an iso contour

1509
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,640
and those two are part of the classical

1510
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,400
helmholtz decomposition

1511
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,359
and then there's this capital lambda

1512
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,839
which is the housekeeping term as it was

1513
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,680
referred to in 32

1514
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,559
and we explored it a bit but it reflects

1515
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,799
the way that that landscape is also

1516
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,040
influenced by movement so we wondered if

1517
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,720
that was like kind of like walking

1518
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,200
around on a trampoline where you can't

1519
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,359
just snapshot the um topographical map

1520
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,440
and then do your navigation on the fixed

1521
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,640
map but there's some change there

1522
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,280
we'll come back to that later

1523
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
so that's section three on solutions

1524
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,680
steady states and non-equilibria

1525
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,599
now we're going to really get to mark

1526
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,359
off blankets

1527
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,559
particles partitions and things

1528
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,319
in section 4.

1529
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,160
all right so

1530
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,359
what do you see in figure one

1531
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,040
yeah i mean see

1532
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,119
uh these two

1533
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,720
inner

1534
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,000
red and green conditioned on each other

1535
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,799
that

1536
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,280
um

1537
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,440
keep these

1538
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,280
external and internal states on the

1539
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,280
outside

1540
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,880
separate

1541
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
they still have

1542
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,200
conditional

1543
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,119
relationship between

1544
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,480
like the sensory states the external

1545
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,000
states and the active states the

1546
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,880
internal states but

1547
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,520
not directly with each other right

1548
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,960
so

1549
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,000
awesome um so they wrote in the caption

1550
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,240
it's an influence diagram

1551
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,559
i believe it's also fairly to say it's a

1552
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,319
bayes graph but we're thinking of the

1553
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,040
arrows as influence and the nodes like

1554
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,920
the circles as variables

1555
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,839
it's a particular partition of states

1556
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,240
particular is a pun because it's it's

1557
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,400
one specific partitioning it's not the

1558
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,319
only partitioning but it's a particular

1559
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,160
one that we're sharing with you

1560
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,960
and it's partitioning that

1561
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,720
into a particle

1562
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,240
into something that's like

1563
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,480
distinguishing figure from ground

1564
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,760
and the four

1565
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,839
states that get partitioned

1566
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,520
are internal states and external states

1567
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,319
that are separated by a markov blanket

1568
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,319
comprised of the sensory and active

1569
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,720
states

1570
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,960
there's a lot that could be said and

1571
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,240
we're going to continue to explore but

1572
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,280
just to give a few more notes

1573
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,559
the partitioning entails that all of

1574
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,200
these states come into existence in a

1575
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,680
model specific way at the same time so

1576
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,119
it's not like there's some feature of

1577
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,280
the world that just is fundamentally an

1578
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,880
internal state

1579
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,119
it's the relationship between

1580
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,960
an internal and external state

1581
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,440
conditioned on a blanket by which all of

1582
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,839
those assignments can be made

1583
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,160
it's like an incomplete sentence

1584
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,640
to have one referenced without the other

1585
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,799
also we have the um names of the states

1586
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,960
mu for internal and ita for external

1587
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,480
and it's kind of like they almost look

1588
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,040
like flips of each other

1589
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,280
then s for sensory states incoming info

1590
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,400
a for action active states outgoing

1591
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,520
actions

1592
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,640
so we have eta external s sensory a

1593
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,440
active and mu internal states

1594
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,400
and then

1595
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,480
there's a few

1596
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,760
couples of states sets of states that we

1597
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,599
are going to care about and the

1598
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,760
equations that describe them have super

1599
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,799
different implications so one set of

1600
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,559
states that's interesting to compare

1601
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,119
together is the blanket states b

1602
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,440
is the set of s and a

1603
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,520
and that's more aligned with the pearl

1604
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,119
1988 formulation of the markov blanket

1605
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,319
or boundary where it was an undirected

1606
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,440
blanket

1607
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,640
and

1608
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,880
fristen and others have developed this

1609
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,119
notion of like a two-way

1610
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,520
partitioning so the blanket is the set

1611
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,920
of both s and a

1612
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,160
the particular states

1613
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,960
pi

1614
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,880
not to be confused with pi

1615
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,079
the policy selection in the po mdp

1616
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,359
the particular states are b

1617
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,480
and mu

1618
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,040
so the blanket and mu so the particular

1619
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,680
states are internal active and sensory

1620
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,079
everything except for external so the

1621
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,440
particle is like the cell

1622
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,920
the boundary and the internal generative

1623
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,200
model

1624
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,520
and then there's the autonomous states

1625
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,480
alpha

1626
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,200
which is just a and mu

1627
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,520
and one way to think about those states

1628
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,119
are like

1629
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,760
if you were to design the system

1630
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,200
those are the states that you can

1631
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,400
control

1632
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,880
you can't directly control the sensory

1633
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,760
input

1634
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,799
which is the only thing that

1635
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,400
differentiates the autonomous from the

1636
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,160
particular states

1637
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,880
you can't directly control what photons

1638
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,960
hit the retina but you could control

1639
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,799
your interpretation

1640
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,040
and your action for where your eyes move

1641
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,880
which might absolutely influence which

1642
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
photons do hit the retina but the

1643
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,720
autonomous states are the ones that

1644
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,960
there's a degree of agency over

1645
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,440
in a way that is slightly different from

1646
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,480
just the

1647
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,480
consideration of the blankets and the

1648
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,520
internal states

1649
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,839
let's continue to talk about some of the

1650
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,400
formalism

1651
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,760
the conditional independencies

1652
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,839
which are going to be uh

1653
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,760
let's pull back one more

1654
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,000
in associating some of these

1655
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
equations of motion

1656
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,160
with a unique non-equilibrium steady

1657
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,720
state or nest density

1658
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,880
we have a somewhat special setup in

1659
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,480
which the influences entailed by the

1660
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,880
equations of motions place constraints

1661
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,039
on the conditional independences

1662
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,280
of the nest density

1663
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,359
these conditional independencies can be

1664
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,359
used to identify a particular partition

1665
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,640
of states

1666
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,559
into external sensory active and

1667
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,680
internal states as shown in the figure

1668
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,520
this is an important move

1669
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,799
in what space

1670
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,559
because it separates the states of a

1671
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,920
particle

1672
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,680
internal states and their sensory and

1673
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,720
active states the particular states

1674
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,559
from the remaining i.e external states

1675
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,200
to do this we have to establish how the

1676
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,440
causal dynamics in one underwrite

1677
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,599
conditional independencies

1678
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,839
this can be done simply by using the

1679
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,920
curvature or second derivative of

1680
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,799
surprisal as follows so how is the

1681
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,200
second derivative of surprise related to

1682
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,480
causal

1683
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,839
sparse dynamics

1684
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,720
in your own words what is the formal

1685
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,200
description of a marco blanket

1686
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,920
what's this sort of minimal

1687
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,880
markov blanket this is a slide from

1688
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,000
livestream 26 on bayesian mechanics this

1689
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,480
is like an undirected blanket we don't

1690
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,799
have s and a separated just b

1691
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,039
intermediating and partitioning

1692
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,799
making mu and etsa conditionally

1693
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,119
independent

1694
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,000
and what about the fristen blankets type

1695
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,160
with sense and action separated what

1696
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,319
about nested markov blankets and so on

1697
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,599
and so on but just to look at seven we

1698
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,039
basically have

1699
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,039
x u and v

1700
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,440
x sub u and x sub v

1701
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,839
are conditionally

1702
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,400
independent conditioned upon

1703
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,039
b

1704
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,680
the blanket

1705
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,400
dot dot fancy i surprise

1706
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,480
d squared of surprise

1707
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,559
partial derivative second derivative of

1708
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,400
surprise

1709
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,400
dot equals zero

1710
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,319
what does it mean how is the second

1711
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,640
derivative of surprise related to causal

1712
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,078
dynamics and the

1713
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,799
partitioning but continuing with a

1714
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,119
sparse coupling notion

1715
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,039
sparse coupling means that any two

1716
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,880
states are conditionally independent if

1717
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,000
one state does not influence the other

1718
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,079
tautology number

1719
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,440
five

1720
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,280
this is an important observation namely

1721
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,880
that sparse coupling implies the

1722
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,119
non-equilibrium steady state density

1723
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,440
with conditional independencies

1724
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,559
in turn

1725
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,680
this means any dynamical influence graph

1726
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,280
with absent or directed edges admits a

1727
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,880
markov blanket

1728
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,760
so if your variables are all connected

1729
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,839
to each other it's a fully connected

1730
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,920
social network it's a fully connected

1731
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,400
statistical model

1732
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,440
then

1733
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,039
i guess you could argue it has a blanket

1734
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,799
with respect to some other things that

1735
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,160
you didn't model or you could get into

1736
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,680
that whole question but within that

1737
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,400
model there are no blanket partitions to

1738
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,680
make

1739
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,680
if there are any absent edges

1740
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,480
then

1741
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,319
there are some states

1742
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,200
which upon knowing them make some other

1743
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,200
states conditionally independent

1744
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,240
they give some more technical details

1745
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,680
and then they raise a question in the

1746
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,680
footnote why does the particular

1747
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,240
partition comprise four sets of states

1748
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,000
we'll talk about that in

1749
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,559
dot one

1750
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,359
continuing on sparse coupling and

1751
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,520
formalism nine we can define sparse

1752
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,119
coupling as the solution to this

1753
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,119
equation in which all the terms are

1754
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,640
identically zero

1755
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,920
so

1756
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,839
what terms are zero

1757
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,280
what is the reading of this equation

1758
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,680
meaning under what situations are they

1759
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,079
zero are they being measured and

1760
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,559
said to be estimated at zero are they

1761
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,400
being dictated to be zero so what terms

1762
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,599
are zero what does that mean in nine

1763
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,480
sparse coupling means the jacobian

1764
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,280
coupling states u and v is zero so on

1765
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,640
either side of the blanket is zero

1766
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,920
look in seven

1767
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,079
u and v they're on the they're on either

1768
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,440
side of the blanket conditioned upon

1769
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,160
that blanket existing

1770
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,920
i.e there's an absence of direct

1771
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,799
coupling from one of those to the other

1772
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,520
this definition precludes

1773
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,760
solenoidal coupling with u that depends

1774
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,799
on v

1775
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,280
because h and gamma

1776
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,440
are positive definite sparse coupling

1777
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,280
requires associated elements of the

1778
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
solenoidal operator and the hessian to

1779
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,200
vanish at every point in state space

1780
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,799
which in turn implies conditional

1781
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,160
independence

1782
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,680
so

1783
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,920
what is being shown here

1784
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,680
but just to give one more visual way of

1785
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,520
looking at it this was figure eight from

1786
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,079
live stream 32

1787
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,280
and

1788
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,440
um we had

1789
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,520
basically uh

1790
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,480
six

1791
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,839
variables

1792
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,559
that were in two clusters of three

1793
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,160
and they were like two communicating

1794
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,359
entities

1795
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,920
and so they were being coupled by this

1796
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,400
like one to four connection

1797
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,119
and so up here on the top left there's

1798
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,000
strong coupling within nodes one two and

1799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,440
three

1800
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,119
and then there's strong coupling within

1801
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,839
this click of four five and six

1802
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,079
and then there was a sparse coupling

1803
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,839
between the systems with a 1 4

1804
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,160
and there is also somewhat of a sparse

1805
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,920
coupling within

1806
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,400
the click because they're not all black

1807
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,520
squares

1808
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,319
so

1809
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,160
we'll return to this and it's again on

1810
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,920
the theme of how is sparse coupling

1811
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,559
related to the particular partition

1812
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,200
and a bayesian mechanics for particular

1813
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,680
systems

1814
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,559
they give some more formalisms in 11

1815
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,960
about blankets and couplings and flow

1816
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,000
we'll go into it later

1817
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,600
and 13 is very informative

1818
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,520
the normal form means that particular

1819
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,679
partitions can be defined in terms of

1820
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,600
sparse couplings

1821
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,679
perhaps the simplest definition

1822
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,759
that guarantees a markov blanket is as

1823
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,198
follows

1824
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,359
external states only influence sensory

1825
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,279
states

1826
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,479
and

1827
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,719
internal states only influence active

1828
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,238
states

1829
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,238
this means that sensory states are not

1830
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,120
influenced by internal states

1831
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,158
and

1832
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,319
active states are not influenced by

1833
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,198
external states

1834
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,399
here's formalism 13. so recall

1835
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,000
eta external s sensory a active mu

1836
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,198
internal

1837
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,158
so

1838
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,080
f is the flow

1839
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,839
and omega

1840
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,600
is going to be the noise

1841
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,920
and the subscript in

1842
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,960
something is here like

1843
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,640
tagging it

1844
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,359
to be about that variable so

1845
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,399
we have

1846
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,719
the rates of change through time

1847
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,600
here's like a vector or a tuple this

1848
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,799
vector is describing the four states

1849
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,600
and it's how external sense action and

1850
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,080
internal states are changing

1851
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,759
function of time

1852
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,198
this

1853
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,520
just like formula one

1854
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,439
is going to be unpacked where we had x

1855
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,880
dot of t

1856
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,920
equals

1857
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,238
flow plus noise

1858
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,560
here we're doing like four of those in

1859
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,799
parallel and so it's like

1860
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,120
external states changing through time

1861
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,640
is a flow on external states

1862
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,238
as a function of

1863
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,560
external sense and action

1864
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,760
plus the noise of external states is a

1865
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,520
function of time

1866
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,120
so sense and external states

1867
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,600
are a function of external sense and

1868
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,960
action states

1869
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,760
plus accompanied noise terms

1870
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,120
whereas

1871
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,120
action and internal states are functions

1872
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,920
of

1873
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,640
sense action and internal states

1874
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,960
and so it's like external and sensory

1875
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,159
states

1876
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,040
are not being caused by internal states

1877
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,400
that's the only missing guy here mew

1878
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,960
it looks like nsa it's not it's eta sa

1879
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,400
conversely the autonomous states

1880
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,440
the ones that we have more agency over

1881
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,640
the odd one out the missing you know

1882
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,159
the dog that's not barking is etta

1883
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,080
so these

1884
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,920
autonomous states

1885
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,600
are flows

1886
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,719
on

1887
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,960
sense action blankets

1888
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,280
and internal states

1889
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,440
so the bottom two rows are the

1890
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,120
autonomous states

1891
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,679
and those are defined as flows

1892
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,320
of particular states

1893
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,120
functions of flows that are using the

1894
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,040
particular variables

1895
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,320
whereas

1896
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,360
the

1897
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,719
external incense are driven by external

1898
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,760
facing variables

1899
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,360
how would you read that

1900
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,280
under the sparse coupling it's simple to

1901
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,280
show that path show that not only are

1902
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,400
internal and external states

1903
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
conditionally independent but their

1904
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,600
paths are conditionally independent

1905
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,159
given that path integral formulation

1906
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:36,960
okay

1907
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,480
any thoughts on

1908
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,839
these last few

1909
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,759
um

1910
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,480
yeah again i just feel like

1911
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,560
whether the math is landing for people

1912
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,960
and this um

1913
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,880
you know separation of the internal

1914
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,760
states and the being

1915
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,679
the the internal flows being conditioned

1916
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:02,719
on

1917
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,520
the sort of the atomic states right like

1918
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,960
um

1919
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,719
it's also it's just

1920
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,760
partially like tautological or

1921
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,440
just just makes

1922
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,840
sense in the simple the way that the

1923
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,360
model is presented

1924
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,360
um

1925
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
a couple slides back

1926
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,880
i'm not sure if i guess this is the

1927
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,360
right spot to bring it up though but um

1928
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,280
thinking also about just so like

1929
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,520
i think a question that i have

1930
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,239
frequently about this is like

1931
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,480
where did they come from where do things

1932
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,320
come from well they come from you know

1933
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,719
the separation and conditioning of you

1934
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,239
know particularly from the background

1935
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,480
and the blanket forming out of blankets

1936
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,159
for him et cetera or where is

1937
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,440
what's the difference between the

1938
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,360
internal stay the extra like you said if

1939
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,239
there's

1940
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,239
you know this giant social graph doll

1941
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,159
everything's connected they're all

1942
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,320
connected then then there's no markup

1943
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,760
blankets

1944
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,000
um

1945
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,040
just like two cells in the body how do

1946
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,440
they know

1947
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,840
that they're

1948
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,400
not

1949
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:18,760
um

1950
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,760
[Music]

1951
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,280
you know

1952
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,440
they both have their own markov blankets

1953
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,000
and yet they are both like external

1954
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,480
states that are indistinguishable from

1955
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,199
kind of the rest of stuff

1956
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,000
to

1957
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,560
themselves right

1958
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,719
for each of them right

1959
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,060
um

1960
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,640
[Music]

1961
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,480
like

1962
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,080
over time

1963
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:44,960
that

1964
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,199
you know dissipates

1965
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:48,480
right

1966
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,080
and so

1967
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,679
yeah i just i guess i wonder like

1968
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,440
the overtime

1969
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,920
um dot notation here like

1970
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,480
how that

1971
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,519
the dynamics of

1972
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,800
how something becomes an

1973
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
internal state or an external stage how

1974
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,880
that exactly happens because again it

1975
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,239
just seems like when you look at a lot

1976
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,440
of examples

1977
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,880
on you know our

1978
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,320
entropic physics you know um anthropic

1979
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,760
like um

1980
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,760
state where we're right like everything

1981
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,360
is good for us

1982
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,120
um and everything we can observe right

1983
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,640
because it's

1984
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,640
like galaxies or something oh they're so

1985
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,080
far away they don't you know there's a

1986
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,159
lot of intergalactic

1987
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:37,440
you know in space that's not affecting

1988
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,600
it's very external

1989
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,199
you rewind it a few billion years like

1990
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,520
lots of interaction lots of

1991
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,640
markov blankets so it's like um

1992
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,360
yeah like

1993
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,600
where does that

1994
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,159
begin and end yeah

1995
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,280
oh markov where art thy sting

1996
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,800
yeah

1997
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,159
um formalism 14 and 15

1998
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,120
are

1999
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,760
further details on the entropy of

2000
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,080
internal and external paths and the

2001
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,679
conditional independencies of paths

2002
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,480
that's going to conclude section 4

2003
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
particles partitions and things which

2004
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,480
was about the markov blanket

2005
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,600
partitioning

2006
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,440
of particles particular states and so on

2007
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,679
we'll move pretty quickly through the

2008
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,760
following sections

2009
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,000
section five from self-organization to

2010
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
self-evidencing

2011
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,159
equipped with a particular partition we

2012
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:37,520
can

2013
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,280
now talk about things in terms of their

2014
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,159
internal states and markov boundary

2015
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,400
namely autonomous states

2016
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,400
and we can talk about particles

2017
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,640
particular states

2018
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,719
the next step is to characterize the

2019
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,800
flow of the autonomous states

2020
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,920
in relation to external states

2021
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,199
in other words

2022
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,120
considering the nature of the coupling

2023
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,640
between the outside and inside of the

2024
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,520
particle across its markov blanket

2025
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,760
it is at this point that we move towards

2026
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,600
a bayesian mechanics

2027
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
that is the special provenance of

2028
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
systems with particular partitions

2029
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,920
the existence of a particular partition

2030
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,159
means that given sensory states

2031
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,320
one can define the conditional density

2032
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,640
over external states as being

2033
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,640
parameterized by the most likely

2034
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,960
internal state and we had several

2035
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,120
discussions in live stream 26 on

2036
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,280
bayesian mechanics with lance decosta

2037
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,440
this is where variational inference is

2038
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,360
going to come into play we will call

2039
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,000
this a variational density parameterized

2040
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
by the internal mode

2041
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,800
q

2042
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,120
the distribution we control of

2043
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,719
internal states

2044
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,600
mu

2045
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,719
about

2046
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,640
external states eta is defined as

2047
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,520
p

2048
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,719
of external states conditioned on sense

2049
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,960
equation 16 means that for every sensory

2050
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,800
state there's a conditional density over

2051
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,040
external states and a corresponding

2052
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,960
internal mode with the smallest

2053
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,560
surprisal

2054
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,400
this mode specifies the variational

2055
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,600
density

2056
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,600
where by definition the kl divergence

2057
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,000
between the variational density and the

2058
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,560
conditional density over external states

2059
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,320
is zero

2060
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,520
more formalisms more details

2061
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,600
inducing the variational density is an

2062
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,199
important move

2063
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,400
it means

2064
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,800
that for every sensory state there is a

2065
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,040
corresponding active mode and an

2066
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,880
internal mode

2067
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,760
this mode does not mean style here mode

2068
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,679
means like the

2069
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,040
most

2070
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,880
common value in a statistical

2071
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,440
distribution

2072
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,000
the active and internal modes constitute

2073
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,520
active and internal manifolds

2074
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,360
we will see later that these manifolds

2075
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,600
play the role of sensor manifolds namely

2076
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,600
manifolds that contain paths that do not

2077
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,880
diverge or converge exponentially

2078
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,280
the open of exponents

2079
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,960
the internal manifold is also a

2080
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,960
statistical manifold because it is

2081
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,880
equipped with a metric and implicit

2082
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,040
information geometry

2083
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,360
this is because movement on the internal

2084
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,120
statistical manifold changes the

2085
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,120
variational density

2086
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,960
this is moving towards that dual

2087
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,400
information

2088
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,600
geometry perspective

2089
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,640
what is equation 17 showing

2090
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,640
we're looking at the flows

2091
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,159
because if we're interested in those

2092
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,400
paths of least action

2093
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,440
we can discount that fluctuation term

2094
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,120
the expectation of the fluctuations is

2095
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,760
zero so we're able to drop those omegas

2096
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,120
with a subscript that we saw in 13.

2097
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,880
so now we're going to be looking at the

2098
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,880
flows on

2099
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,280
different states

2100
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,239
as

2101
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,560
for the top two the external and the

2102
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,159
sense states those are going to be

2103
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,760
about surprise

2104
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,640
fracture i fancy i

2105
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,159
for action

2106
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,480
and internal states the autonomous

2107
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,719
states

2108
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,560
that is

2109
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,280
free energy

2110
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,080
minimizing surprise about external and

2111
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,159
sensory states

2112
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,239
minimizing free energy

2113
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,519
about autonomous states

2114
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,840
what is that f

2115
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,600
the free energy in question is an upper

2116
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
bound on the surprisal of particular

2117
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,560
states

2118
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,920
so in variational bayesian methods

2119
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,640
elbow and free energy are used to bound

2120
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,400
the surprisal

2121
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,120
here we're bounding surprisal

2122
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,679
on a particular partitioning

2123
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,840
including action

2124
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,560
to model the action perception loop

2125
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,920
so

2126
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,560
we've seen variational free energy

2127
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,480
several times

2128
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,320
what do these different rearrangements

2129
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,840
mean

2130
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,679
what other rearrangements or

2131
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,159
restatements of f

2132
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,799
are possible

2133
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,800
they give a few

2134
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,600
thoughts here

2135
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,440
anything you want to add on variational

2136
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,280
free energy

2137
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,040
knowing that we'll have a lot of time to

2138
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,800
go into that's why just bringing it up

2139
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,120
that's what formalism 17 and 18 bring us

2140
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,159
two

2141
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:18,960
yeah

2142
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,000
back to pat the path and a goal um you

2143
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,440
know say like um

2144
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,440
[Music]

2145
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,678
it's

2146
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,040
i'm wondering

2147
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,960
my question is um in relation to action

2148
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,880
and energy and the way this is being

2149
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,440
stated like what

2150
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:39,890
um

2151
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:42,969
[Music]

2152
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,520
yeah what is what is the

2153
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,040
like action

2154
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,600
version of this that's what is

2155
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,159
like the

2156
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,520
easy to miss like

2157
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,040
oh it's just energy

2158
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,120
um

2159
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,000
thing that is

2160
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,840
in the way of like framing this here um

2161
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,440
because they're not the same thing

2162
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,400
like so um

2163
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,679
yeah that's my question is just

2164
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,320
differentiating that or or

2165
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,840
better defining

2166
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,440
which parts are action which parts are

2167
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,600
the energy components of that

2168
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
that's what i would like be interested

2169
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,920
in rearranging or thinking about yeah

2170
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,760
these equations

2171
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,199
cool

2172
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,639
um they write in

2173
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,000
footnote 19 is variational free energy

2174
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,239
the same kind of free energy found in

2175
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,000
thermodynamics

2176
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,800
like

2177
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,040
gibbs free energy perhaps

2178
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,719
the answer is no

2179
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,400
this entropy is distinct from the

2180
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,080
thermodynamic entropy of internal states

2181
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,320
we're going to return to this into half

2182
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,840
are we talking about thermal free energy

2183
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,280
or are we seeing equations that look

2184
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,840
like descriptors of thermal entropy but

2185
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,320
we're applying them in an informational

2186
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,400
setting

2187
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,719
we'll return to it

2188
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,800
as they had brought up before

2189
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,239
one can formulate

2190
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,120
um

2191
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,800
this along the lines of a center

2192
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,880
manifold theorem

2193
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,800
where we have a fast flow towards the

2194
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,000
center manifold and a slow flow on the

2195
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,400
manifold

2196
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,000
going fast

2197
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,080
towards the valley

2198
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,120
ravine

2199
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,239
and then

2200
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,719
going slow on the river

2201
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,880
this decomposition can be derived simply

2202
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,960
using taylor expansion taylor series

2203
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,600
expansion around the time varying

2204
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,120
autonomous mode

2205
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,239
so

2206
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,719
here is a taylor series expansion

2207
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,960
it's evaluating a function at a given

2208
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,000
point

2209
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,600
usually zero

2210
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,120
and then

2211
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,120
taking its first derivative

2212
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,120
and then taking its second derivative

2213
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,760
and using higher and higher derivatives

2214
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,679
to approximate

2215
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,400
increasing distances from the reference

2216
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,520
single points where that

2217
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,480
function was actually evaluated

2218
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,040
so how is the taylor series expansion or

2219
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,920
other

2220
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,840
power series expansions

2221
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,120
related to

2222
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,159
time varying autonomous modes

2223
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,840
what about that flow on the center

2224
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,400
manifold we know from 17

2225
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,320
that the flow of autonomous mode can be

2226
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,080
expressed in terms of free energy

2227
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,000
gradients

2228
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,440
those are the two f's on the autonomous

2229
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,600
um

2230
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,480
so

2231
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,320
this expression 20

2232
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,159
unpacks the manifold flow in terms of

2233
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,080
accuracy and complexity

2234
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,400
parts of free energy where the accuracy

2235
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,840
part depends on the sensory

2236
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,080
states the complexity part is a function

2237
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,080
of and only of

2238
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,400
autonomous states

2239
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,159
the manifold will look as if it is

2240
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,239
trying to maximize the accuracy of its

2241
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:00,719
predictions while complying with prior

2242
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,719
bayesian beliefs

2243
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,880
bayesian statistics these are all

2244
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,800
bayesian variables

2245
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,960
here predictions are read

2246
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,719
as expected sensory states under

2247
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,719
posterior bayesian beliefs about their

2248
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:13,840
causes

2249
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,480
namely variational density over external

2250
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,080
states

2251
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,600
the real temperature out there in the

2252
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,120
room hidden unobserved external state

2253
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,000
thermometer reading sensory state and

2254
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,480
then states some sort of cognitive

2255
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,800
mirror or representation

2256
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,080
as modeled

2257
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,000
of temperature

2258
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,239
that's conditioned upon the thermometer

2259
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,520
reading

2260
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,639
but there's some generalized synchrony

2261
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,239
across that

2262
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,760
thermometer blanket

2263
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,400
um in footnote 21.

2264
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,239
they write question do particles

2265
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,239
minimize surprisal or free energy

2266
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,400
and we'll go into it because they say

2267
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,639
minimization implies the teleology that

2268
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,400
goes beyond any claim of the fep

2269
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,679
whence

2270
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,120
teleology

2271
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,960
i thought we were like talking about

2272
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,040
teleology earlier

2273
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,000
so

2274
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,960
how deep in the desert are we what what

2275
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,120
what level of mirage are we engaging in

2276
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,960
but we'll get there

2277
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,800
and that takes us to

2278
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,480
uh figure two

2279
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,679
which is going to show two components of

2280
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,239
autonomous flow conditioned upon sensory

2281
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,520
states

2282
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,960
so

2283
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,080
i'll move us away

2284
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,760
we can talk more about the technical

2285
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,920
details like how it relies on the taylor

2286
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,520
expansion

2287
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,880
but here are the autonomous states

2288
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,639
and the black line potentially can be

2289
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,199
read as like that manifold attractor

2290
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:57,760
and so there's a movement towards

2291
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,000
directly towards

2292
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,239
the attractor

2293
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,440
and then

2294
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,360
there's a movement

2295
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,800
that is um

2296
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,280
perhaps orthogonalized

2297
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,040
keeping in mind the difference between

2298
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,639
the gradient and the solenoidal flow

2299
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,320
and together

2300
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,159
through time so this is not just like a

2301
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,120
hill

2302
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,880
previously like in 26 we saw like the

2303
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,880
hill and the particle makes its way to

2304
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,760
the top of the hill as a function of

2305
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,280
gradient ascent and solenoidal coupling

2306
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,400
flow

2307
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,600
here we're not just ascending a hill

2308
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,000
like we're tracking this moving point

2309
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,080
through time

2310
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,920
but we're converging in this spiral way

2311
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,840
and then we can maybe unpack that in

2312
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,080
relationship to manifold flow

2313
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,080
and how even if this black line is the

2314
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,440
manifold

2315
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,040
then

2316
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,040
how is the entity staying on the

2317
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,719
manifold

2318
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:57,440
so

2319
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,360
we'll talk more about figure two

2320
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,120
now they're going to summarize this

2321
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,360
section a particular partition of

2322
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,800
non-equilibrium steady state nest

2323
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
density implies autonomous dynamics can

2324
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,679
be interpreted as performing inference

2325
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,040
particular kind

2326
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,880
it's not doing every kind it's doing a

2327
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,760
specific kind and it's a particle

2328
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,600
there's the fast flow towards the center

2329
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,600
manifold and the slow flow on manifold

2330
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,440
the manifold flow

2331
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,280
can be interpreted as bayesian belief

2332
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,760
updating and posterior bayesian beliefs

2333
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,480
are encoded by points on the internal

2334
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,080
states statistical manifold

2335
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,760
in other words

2336
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,199
for every point on the statistical

2337
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,440
manifold that synchronization manifold

2338
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,960
there's a corresponding variational

2339
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,280
density or bayesian belief over external

2340
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,400
states

2341
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,480
these are internal states

2342
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,560
about external states

2343
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,080
conditioned on the particular

2344
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,440
partitioning

2345
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,440
and that can now be expressed as the

2346
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,920
variational principle of leased action

2347
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,480
this is the basis of the fep

2348
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,600
put simply but not too simply i guess

2349
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,360
it means that the internal states of a

2350
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,679
particular partition can be cast as

2351
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,600
encoding conditional or posterior

2352
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,679
bayesian beliefs about external states

2353
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,840
this license is a poetic description of

2354
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,159
self-organization as self-evidencing

2355
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,600
we'll unpack it later just wanted to

2356
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,520
mention it so we can continue

2357
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,880
in figure 3

2358
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,800
several different ways

2359
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,280
in which this self evidencing

2360
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,080
is connected to various

2361
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,840
theories

2362
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,520
for example value surprise entropy and

2363
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,440
model evidence

2364
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,679
and the schematic is illustrating how

2365
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:44,320
minimizing variational free energy

2366
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,000
wait but i thought that minimization

2367
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,920
implies the teleology that goes beyond

2368
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,199
any claim of the fep

2369
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,920
but minimizing variational free energy

2370
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,760
relates to normative theories of optimal

2371
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,880
behavior

2372
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,600
like

2373
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,000
value maximization

2374
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,480
pragmatic reinforcement reward learning

2375
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,159
pavlov

2376
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,600
surprise

2377
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,199
novelty info gain infomax

2378
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,360
why is the free energy principle here

2379
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,280
isn't it like

2380
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,719
all of them

2381
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:15,760
entropy

2382
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,840
and model evidence as well

2383
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,120
and then just to conclude the section

2384
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,880
um

2385
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,719
they ask is it tenable to interpret

2386
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,480
gradient flows on variational free

2387
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,080
energy landscapes

2388
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,320
as variational inference or is this just

2389
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,920
teleological window dressing

2390
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,679
the next section addresses this question

2391
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,920
through the lens of bayesian filtering

2392
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,760
in brief we will see that autonomous

2393
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,760
paths of least action implied by our

2394
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,760
particular partition are the paths of

2395
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,280
least action of a bayesian filter

2396
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,120
this takes us beyond as if arguments

2397
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,880
by establishing a formal connection

2398
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,560
between particular dynamics and

2399
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,639
variational inference

2400
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,480
so

2401
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:05,879
to discuss what are particular dynamics

2402
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,560
what is variational inference

2403
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,320
what is the relationship between

2404
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,719
particular dynamics and variational

2405
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,159
inference what would it mean for it to

2406
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,520
be as if

2407
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,560
and what would it mean for it to be

2408
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,280
something different than as if

2409
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,320
okay

2410
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,600
continuing

2411
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,880
on

2412
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
six lagrangians generalized states and

2413
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,440
bayesian filtering

2414
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,000
now say we wanted to emulate or simulate

2415
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,199
active inference

2416
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,960
what if what if that were the case

2417
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,120
we could find the stationary solution to

2418
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,719
the faulker planck equation and the

2419
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,320
accompanying helmholtz decomposition

2420
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,400
we could then solve number 21

2421
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,920
we call its paths of least action that

2422
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,679
characterize the expected behavior of

2423
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,920
this kind of particle

2424
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,159
however there is a simpler way to

2425
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,639
recover the paths of least action

2426
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,880
by finding a path that minimizes

2427
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,520
lagrangian at every point in time

2428
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,000
noting from three that the path integral

2429
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,679
of the lagrangian is the action

2430
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,440
first they're going to reintroduce

2431
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,520
generalized coordinates of motion

2432
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,679
so we talked about that in number 26 as

2433
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,760
well but the generalized coordinates of

2434
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,840
motion are like the position

2435
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,080
velocity acceleration and higher and

2436
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,000
higher and higher derivatives

2437
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,880
of

2438
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,520
the coordinates of location

2439
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,080
so it's taking like the x y coordinates

2440
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,440
and adding their first derivative and

2441
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,800
their second derivative and their third

2442
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,320
derivative and just having that in a

2443
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,199
vector so that's what's shown here

2444
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,480
x through time

2445
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,639
the derivative of x x prime

2446
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,120
is a flow

2447
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,880
the second derivative

2448
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,199
the first derivative and so on that's

2449
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:50,400
the integrator chains pid control and so

2450
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,760
on

2451
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,840
in the generalized coordinates of motion

2452
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,000
state velocity acceleration and so on

2453
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,760
are treated as separate generalized

2454
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,960
states that are coupled through the

2455
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,960
jacobian

2456
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,719
so if the first and the second are

2457
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:03,920
related to each other in the second and

2458
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,760
third and third and the fourth there's a

2459
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,400
sparse coupling in that

2460
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,920
vector

2461
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,639
this allows us to relax certain

2462
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,800
assumptions

2463
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:19,520
and gives a quadratic form

2464
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,159
we'll unpack this more but

2465
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,480
there's a sparsity

2466
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,800
and a capacity to do

2467
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,880
modeling of movement in the generalized

2468
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,199
coordinates of motion now maybe three

2469
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,679
maybe six are sufficient but this is

2470
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,199
like an infinite dimensional framework

2471
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,719
but it may be the case that you can go

2472
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:40,719
super far with like just

2473
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,719
a few

2474
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,320
um

2475
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,199
formalisms 23 and 24

2476
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,400
describe

2477
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,880
that m can be read as a mass matrix

2478
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,480
that would be interesting to know what

2479
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,760
is meant there and there's a suggestion

2480
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,520
that precise particles

2481
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,080
with low amplitude random fluctuations

2482
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,239
behave like massive bodies

2483
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,400
so that's like the baseball on the the

2484
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,880
parabola the air fluctuations and the

2485
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,880
thermal vibrations are not dominating

2486
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,679
its trajectory but the one molecule

2487
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,120
baseball it is getting tossed and turned

2488
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:19,040
in equation 25 and 26

2489
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,280
they continue describing

2490
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,360
using that helmholtz

2491
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,400
decomposition the divergence free flow

2492
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,280
and the curl free flow

2493
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,360
in terms of the gradient descent

2494
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,880
on a lagrangian

2495
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,719
that'll be helpful to learn what they

2496
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:35,760
mean

2497
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,080
and then crucially when that is

2498
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,600
minimized

2499
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,520
the mode of the path becomes the path of

2500
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,840
the mode

2501
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
that would be something useful to

2502
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,000
understand what is meant

2503
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,639
what's the difference between tracking

2504
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:51,760
the mean

2505
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,400
and tracking the mode

2506
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,960
for gaussian distributions

2507
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,840
like the laplace approximation or any

2508
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,679
other second order

2509
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,520
curvature

2510
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,639
what does that

2511
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,159
mean

2512
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,639
and then just to close this section

2513
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,960
the generalized free energy is easy to

2514
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,080
evaluate

2515
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,520
thankfully

2516
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,280
given a generative model in the form of

2517
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,840
a state-space model

2518
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,040
here it is

2519
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,920
f

2520
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,199
of sense action and internal

2521
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,120
is going to be

2522
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,320
some terms

2523
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,080
that we'll learn about

2524
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,080
and finally one can simulate active

2525
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,120
inference

2526
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,040
by replacing the generalized flow of

2527
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,800
autonomous states with a generalized

2528
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,560
bayesian filter

2529
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,199
so here we have 27.

2530
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,719
very similar

2531
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,159
except notice that there's a lot more

2532
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,320
arrows

2533
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,239
and

2534
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,560
the bottom two

2535
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,440
instead of 13

2536
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,760
we now have these bottom two rows with

2537
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,000
the d on a

2538
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
and the d on mu

2539
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,880
and some triangles have been introduced

2540
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,840
we'll unpack more what that

2541
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,600
means any thoughts or comments or we'll

2542
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,400
continue to seven

2543
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,159
so yeah

2544
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,440
awesome

2545
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,199
sevens from statistical to classical

2546
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,560
particles

2547
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,239
so far we have a bayesian mechanics that

2548
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,840
would be apt to describe a particle or

2549
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,159
person with pullback attractor but what

2550
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,000
is the difference between a particle and

2551
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,400
a person

2552
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,639
this speaks

2553
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,239
to distinct classes of things to which

2554
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,840
fep could apply molecular versus

2555
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:44,639
biological versus

2556
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:45,920
here we associate biotic

2557
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,760
self-organization with precise and

2558
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,400
predictable dynamics of large particles

2559
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,960
so as we described earlier

2560
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,480
if we were talking about classical

2561
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,360
mechanics something bigger would be more

2562
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,639
resistant to like thermal fluctuation

2563
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,119
we could think about like that analogy

2564
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:06,159
to mass in the statistical setting

2565
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,800
where are the priors like massive and

2566
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,480
they're just on their own inertia and

2567
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,679
they're not being buffeted by

2568
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,560
stochasticity versus where is it a

2569
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,159
lightweight

2570
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,199
something

2571
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,760
that is getting buffeted

2572
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,960
so here's going to be a distinction

2573
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,400
between statistical and classical

2574
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,639
mechanics in the setting of the

2575
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,520
particular partition

2576
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,080
it is often said

2577
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,480
that the fep explains why biological

2578
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,639
systems resist the second law

2579
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,480
tendency towards disorder

2580
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,159
and the natural tendency to dissipation

2581
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,360
and disorder

2582
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,560
however

2583
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,280
this is disingenuous on two counts

2584
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,880
so is first in 2013 disingenuous

2585
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,040
or is that paper

2586
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,560
combating

2587
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,440
the disingenuity

2588
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,040
first the second law applies only to

2589
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,040
closed systems while the free energy

2590
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,520
principle describes open systems

2591
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,600
in which internal states are exposed to

2592
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,520
and exchange with external states

2593
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,840
through blanket

2594
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,600
states with lots of unpacked there what

2595
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,840
exactly is the exchange

2596
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,040
is it like an informational exchange

2597
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,600
or are like nutrients crossing and

2598
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,440
becoming incorporated into the internal

2599
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,040
states

2600
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,679
and second there is nothing so far to

2601
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,600
suggest that the entropy of particular

2602
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,119
states or of paths is small

2603
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,360
so this is like the design language for

2604
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,199
particular states that might be totally

2605
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,320
buffeted by stochasticity or totally on

2606
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,639
the least action railroad and everything

2607
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,560
in between

2608
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,159
but nothing has been said to identify

2609
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,840
um one or the other

2610
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,000
and so everything's high and low entropy

2611
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,280
densities

2612
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,760
so there's you know two particles in two

2613
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,159
different rooms one particle is equally

2614
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,000
traveling to all parts of the room the

2615
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,600
other particle is staying in one part of

2616
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,480
the room

2617
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,520
so

2618
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,280
one of them has a very ordered

2619
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,960
distribution of space and the other one

2620
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,760
has a very like disordered you know

2621
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,840
equilibrium gas flowing throughout the

2622
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,280
room

2623
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,840
both of them are particles

2624
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,159
um so what distinguishes between

2625
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,560
high and low entropy systems

2626
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,040
eg between candle flames and concierges

2627
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,840
respectively

2628
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,679
28

2629
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,199
we could have had a concierge

2630
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,159
and that is going to

2631
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:36,000
describe that and we'll come back to it

2632
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,679
this suggests that precise particles

2633
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,520
such as you and me

2634
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,960
respond to environmental flows and

2635
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,400
fluctuations in a precise and

2636
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,119
predictable fashion well i'm an

2637
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,480
unpredictable guy

2638
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,360
yes

2639
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,080
in

2640
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,960
our regime of attention

2641
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,440
it is almost like tuned to some

2642
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,760
maximally confusing or uninformative

2643
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,360
things or we could have some cognitive

2644
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:01,040
experience of being confused but um

2645
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,760
someone's blood sugar through time has

2646
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,719
more predictability than zero so it's on

2647
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,600
that continuum from totally buffeted to

2648
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,800
totally on the railroad tracks and it's

2649
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,560
more like the railroad tracks if you

2650
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,679
want to survive

2651
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,480
or design high reliability systems

2652
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,600
and then they're going to introduce

2653
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,679
figures four five and six

2654
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,360
four is about the difference between

2655
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,360
generic and precise particles using an

2656
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,520
information diagram

2657
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,119
for precise particles there's no

2658
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:30,880
uncertainty about autonomous states

2659
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,800
given sensory states

2660
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,119
knowledge about action knowledge about

2661
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:38,960
internal states like metacognition

2662
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,199
um is the behavior of precise particles

2663
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,679
sufficient for sentient behavior

2664
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,760
perhaps

2665
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,159
figure five the implicit computational

2666
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,719
architecture used in simulations of

2667
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,560
sentient behavior

2668
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,719
and six is reproducing an example from

2669
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,880
the octave literature with action and

2670
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,639
action observation

2671
01:39:58,639 --> 01:39:59,760
so

2672
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,159
figure four

2673
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:04,560
has to do with information gain and

2674
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,639
sharing with generic and precise

2675
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,639
particles

2676
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,000
do you wanna add anything otherwise

2677
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,600
we'll just take one look at each of four

2678
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,960
five and six

2679
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,080
okay

2680
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,800
figure five bayesian mechanics

2681
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,639
graphic summarizes belief updating

2682
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,239
implicit in gradient flows on

2683
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,880
variational free energy

2684
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,000
and six

2685
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,040
sentient behavior and action observation

2686
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,560
so this is like

2687
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,440
somebody involved in pointing or tracing

2688
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,800
or handwriting

2689
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,159
and also

2690
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,638
looking visually

2691
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:39,520
in summary

2692
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,360
precise particles

2693
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,679
immersed in an imprecise world respond

2694
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:45,840
almost deterministically to external

2695
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
fluctuations

2696
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,280
why might this behavior be

2697
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,199
characteristically biological

2698
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,800
precise particles may be the kind of

2699
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,800
particles that show lifelike or biotic

2700
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,560
behavior so let's think of those two

2701
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,960
particles in the two rooms one of them

2702
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,800
24 hours a day no matter what the

2703
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,400
temperature is or what the light dark

2704
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,480
cycle is it's always equally covering

2705
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,480
all parts of the room

2706
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,080
the other particle

2707
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,320
you find out that when it's light it

2708
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,239
stays in this part of the room

2709
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,920
and then when it's dark it stays in this

2710
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,600
other part of the room

2711
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
which one of those particles without

2712
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,760
knowing anything more seems more

2713
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,159
biological the one that's diffusing like

2714
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:25,119
a gas molecule or the one that has this

2715
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,119
orderly distribution

2716
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:29,280
especially one that's conditioned upon

2717
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,480
like salient external factors

2718
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,080
so

2719
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,560
the distinction between those imprecise

2720
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,600
and precise particles

2721
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,199
getting buffeted

2722
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:43,360
by thermal vibrations

2723
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,400
or

2724
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,719
being like the classical like the kepler

2725
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,679
universe like the planets going around

2726
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:50,800
orbits

2727
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,600
totally unbuffeted by thermal vibrations

2728
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,280
rests on their relative contribution of

2729
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,360
dissipative and conservative flow to

2730
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,320
their path through state space one might

2731
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,560
associate precise particles with living

2734
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,480
many many nested biorhythms

2735
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,360

2743
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,400
turning this on its head one can argue

2744
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,920
living systems are a certain kind of

2745

biorhythms and time irreversibility so

2749
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,400
wow how are these all related to each

2750
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,520
other where does the time

the emerging picture is that biotic

2757

2765
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,119
the previous section was focused on

2766
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,119

2767
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:14,560

2768
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,280
to densities over generalized states

2769
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,960
internal states can be construed as

2770
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,880
parameterizing bayesian beliefs about

2771
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,480
external states

2772
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,320
internal states are about external

2773
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,480
states in this model

2774
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,239
in what follows we move from densities

2775
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,639
over states to densities over paths to

2776
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,480
characterize the behavior of particles

2777
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,400
in terms of their trajectories

2778
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,520
so

2779
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,080
formalism 29

2780
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:41,920
we're interested in characterizing

2781
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,320
autonomous responses to initial

2782
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,880

2783
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,800
the action and internal states the ones

2784
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,199
that we control

2785
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,280
recall that when random fluctuations on

2786
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,760
the motion of particular states vanish

2787
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,840
there's no uncertainty about autonomous

2788
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,280
paths given external and sensory paths

2789

knowing exactly what to do and exactly

2790
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,360
what to think

2791
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,520
and there's no uncertainty about sensory

2792
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,159
paths given external and autonomous

2793
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,360

2796

2798
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,080
and thinks

2799
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,159
if we interpret entropies as the

2800
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,159
limiting density of discrete points

2802

2806
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,638

why does it matter that we're focusing

2816

on autonomous states

01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,280
rather than constraining

2841
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,840

and planning afforded by path integral

2849
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,040
formulation one usually works with

2850
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,360
discrete state spaces and belief

2851
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,440
updating over discrete epochs of time

2852
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,119
that's where the partially observable

01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,840
markov decision process pomdp comes into

2854
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,880
play

2855
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,560
and plausible policies can then be

2856
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,159
scored

2857
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,719
evaluated based upon their expected free

energy

2859
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,760
and the next action is selected from the

2860
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,159
most likely policy policies or sequences

2861
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:51,040
of actions that can be taken

2862
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:54,320
in summary we now have at hand a way of

2863
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,400
identifying the most likely autonomous

2864
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,800
trajectory from any initial particular

2865
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,679
state

2866
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,679
that can be used to simulate sentient

2867
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,280
behavior of precise particles that we

2868
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,159
have associated with biotic systems

2869
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:08,480
expected free energy absorbs two aspects

2870
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,400
of bayes optimality into the same

2871
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,920
objective functional

2872
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,119
which is a function with functions

2873
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:16,639
the information gain

2874
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,920
is optimal bayesian design

2875
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,880
bayesian decision theory is minimizing a

2876
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,440
cost function under a decision or choice

2877
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,320
and uncertainty

2878
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,600
as with the interpretation of

2879
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,760
variational free energy

2880
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,080
this dual aspect functionality of

2881
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,639
expected free energy is an

2882
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:38,639
interpretation of a single existential

2883
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:39,679
imperative

2884
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,000
to possess a markov blanket and implicit

2885
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,440
thickness

2886
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,760
teleologically it's worth reflecting

2887
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,960
upon the differences between the

2888
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,400
generative models that underwrite

2889
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,520
variational and expected free energy

2890
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,199
for vfe

2891
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,199
the generative model is a joint density

2892
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:58,480
over external and particular states

2893
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,719
supplied by or supplying the

2894
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,679
non-equilibrium steady state density

2895
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:06,159
for the path integral formulation

2896
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,080
the generative model is a joint

2897
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:11,360
distribution over paths

2898
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,840
because consequences

2899
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,679
the generative model acquires a temporal

2900
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,320
depth

2901
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,480
they then have several figures that

2902
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,560
continue on this theme

2903
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,920
figure seven

2904
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,639
is um related to a

2905
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:29,119
decosta 2020 discrete state space

2906

synthesis paper

2907
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,080
showing special cases of variational and

2908
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,840
expected free energy

2909
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,760
like when there's no preference

2910
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,840
there's optimal information gain

2911
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,080
when there's no ambiguity you get pure

2912
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,840
risk sensitive policy

2913
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,080
when there's no intrinsic value you get

2914
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,239
expected utility theory and when there's

2915
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,400
no ambiguity or preferences some recent

2916
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,159
work by ramstead

2917
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,199
at all have

2918
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,800
started to

2919
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,880
soft reboot the fep and connect

2920
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,880
connecticut principle which we're going

2921
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,080
to be looking forward to learning more

2922
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,280
about

2923
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,320
figure eight is a about bayesian

2924
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,560
mechanics and active inference so we can

2925
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,800
contrast that with figure five bayesian

2926
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,520
mechanics and active inference

2927
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,520
figure eight bayesian mechanics and

2928
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,520
active inference

2929
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,639
figure 9 is a simulation in which eye

2930
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,239
cicades are occurring

2931
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:25,678
and we can explore this more

2932
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,799
to the conclusion

2933
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,159
there are many points of contact between

2934
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:36,960
what we described and other theories

2935
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,800
please

2936
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,040
read the papes

2937
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,119
discuss special cases

2938
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:44,320
they discuss the mechanics of

2939
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,000
synchronization

2940
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,920
separation of time scale and

2941
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,520
applications

2942
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,480
and then

2943
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,080
in closing

2944
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,920
they write about how

2945
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,520
the developments

2946
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,840
are speaking to the shift in focus from

2947
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,760
the foundational issues addressed in

2948
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,159
this article to their applications

2949
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,239
learning and applying active inference

2950
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:05,599
and fep

2951
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,800
it is quite possible that the

2952
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,560
foundational aspects of the free energy

2953
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,280
principle may also shift as simpler

2954
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,599
interpretations and perspectives reveal

2955
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,000
themselves

2956
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,360
that brings us to the end of the dot

2957
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,880
zero so

2958
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,920
brock

2959
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,320
what would you like to add or say

2960
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,840
i would like to add that for the next

2961
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,080
stop zero i will be preparing my answer

2962
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,560
to this part first um ahead of time

2963
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,080
um

2964
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,520
i don't know just writing down a few

2965
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,250
things and thinking about um

2966
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,470
[Music]

2967
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,000
intractability and

2968
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,239
uncertainty and

2969
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:57,280
um

2970
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,639
possible kind of informational

2971
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,119
information entropy kind of um questions

2972
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:07,199
that you could ask around that like what

2973
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:09,840
what makes those kind of ultimate markov

2974
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,440
blankets of intractability um

2975
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:17,040
like how action intensive is it

2976
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:20,400
for information to cross like

2977
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,040
or or for

2978
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:26,239
external for the external um states to

2979
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,199
influence the

2980
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,000
indirectly influence the internal states

2981
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,280
right

2982
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,560
and another question

2983
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,679
how hard do you have to push on the

2984
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:40,080
blanket what kind of push and what so

2985
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,360
yes they're conditionally independent

2986
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:45,598
but also they do influence each other

2987
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:48,239
the blanket so how hard you have to push

2988
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:49,840
yeah

2989
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,040
um

2990
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,800
and it just it seems like i guess what

2991
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,520
i'm saying is that um

2992
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,560
the scale

2993
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,400
uh which we kind of

2994
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,400
you're using the particle people

2995
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,239
and the baseball

2996
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,360
um analogy right um

2997
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,679
and we talked about that

2998
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,520
yesterday or the day about um like

2999
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,400
um

3000
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,400
just a large you know matrix large space

3001
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,920
of

3002
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,639
states of variables of you know

3003
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,520
um dimensions of of what you mean by a

3004
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,080
markov blanket in a particular you know

3005
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,040
and the scale of that markov blanket to

3006
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,080
the environment right

3007
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,760
um

3008
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:38,560
having like a big

3009
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,040
seeming

3010
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:44,880
to have a like a big impact on

3011
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,960
how hard you have to push there

3012
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,320
right

3013
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,800
um the baseball's flying through the air

3014
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,080
but the

3015
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,760
particle is

3016
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,000
spreading out and you know being pushed

3017
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,119
around and yeah and i was like are we

3018
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:00,960
little molecules

3019
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,800
trying to push the baseball

3020
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,280
or are we

3021
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,199
the designated hitter

3022
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,280
who's way overpowered and able to put it

3023
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,679
wherever we want or are we just doing

3024
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:13,920
the tiniest buffeting

3025
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,520
maybe this is a design language that

3026
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,159
helps us frame both of those settings

3027
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,880
and recognize when are we able to

3028
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,760
be

3029
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,760
guiding the path of least action

3030
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,920
and where might no matter how hard we

3031
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,440
yell

3032
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,440
maybe we're not influencing it like

3033
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,840
literally at all

3034
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,719
or

3035
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,719
stick out we're influencing it like

3036
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,599
stick out like stochastically it's not

3037
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:40,480
we can't kind of concentrate our action

3038
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,960
into one

3039
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,000
you know

3040
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,960
path right um one pet like so

3041
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,679
yeah there's i don't know there's a lot

3042
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:54,800
of um

3043
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,719
wonderings and questions that are like

3044
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:58,159
not

3045
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:00,639
uh

3046
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,880
probably very well informed to just

3047
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:07,199
read the papes

3048
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:12,159
on and continue reducing uncertainty

3049
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,280
um

3050
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,199
yeah

3051
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:17,119
awesome work with this dot zero and

3052
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,119
thanks a ton for being a part of it

3053
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:20,800
thanks to everybody for watching and all

3054
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,960
the great comments in the chat

3055
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,560
and we'll see you

3056
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,440
in the dot one and the dot two

3057
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,360
bye awesome

3058
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,519
thank you

3059
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,840
you
