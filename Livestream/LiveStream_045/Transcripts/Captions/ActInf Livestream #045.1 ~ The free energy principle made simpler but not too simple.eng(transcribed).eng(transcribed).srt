00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
all right hello and welcome everyone

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,440
it's active lab live stream number 45.1

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
it's june 1st 2022

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
welcome to the active lab we're a

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,320
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
applied active inference

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,840
you can find us at the links here on the

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
slide

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
this is recorded and an archived live

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,840
feedback so we can improve our work

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,359
welcome and we'll be following good

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
video etiquette for live streams

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
head over to activeinference.org to find

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,080
out more about

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
what we're up to at the lab and

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
participate if you'd like to get

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,439
involved

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,799
we're here in

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
live stream number 45.1

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,200
and we're in our second discussion

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
around this paper the free energy

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
principle made simpler but not too

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,640
simple

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
by first in decosta sajid heinz ultofer

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
pavliotis and par

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
and the video just like all them are is

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,240
a introduction and an invitation

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
for those who would like to

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,079
ask questions in the live chat for those

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
who would like to join us next week in

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,119
the conversation

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
and just to try to learn and unpack and

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
understand this paper as well as seeing

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
it as a starting point for

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
the continued learning and applying that

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
we're all involved in

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
and

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
we will just begin with some

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
introductions and overviews

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
remind ourselves where we've been in

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
this paper and then start to think about

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,000
where we're going

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,560
and we'll see who joins

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
we'll see who asks

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
questions in the live chat

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
and i guess where we go together

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
so we can begin just by giving an

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
introduction saying hi and mentioning

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
anything like what's something that

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
we're excited about what's something

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
that we liked or remembered about the

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,480
paper

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
and what is something that we're

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
wondering about or would like to resolve

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
towards the end of the discussion

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,599
so

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
california and i'll answer the questions

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,440
later how about you blue

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,599
i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
and i don't know why i'm tasked with

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
going first

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
um

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,959
there's there's a lot of things that i

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
think i would like to

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,680
have

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
resolved or

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
a greater certainty about

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
like including

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
the hierarchical nature of

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
active inference and how mathematically

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
that works out

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
as well as uh like the time dependence

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
and time independence

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
um and i'm curious about

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,319
uh

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
like can

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
i don't know yeah we can get more into

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
it later

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,560
um

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
yeah

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
okay

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,879
while people are

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
filing in and getting their questions

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
ready

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
let's take a look back at

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
big question

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
kind of situate ourselves in this paper

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
and just recall

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,560
also what the main sections are in the

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
roadmap

97
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
so

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
brock and i worked together on 45.0

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,239
and we highlighted the big question just

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
one way to ask it

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,280
as

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
what are the foundations of the free

103
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
energy principle fep

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
and what does it contribute and then

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
also we can ask how is active inference

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
related to fep

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,959
and

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,840
we

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
drew from the abstract

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
where they mentioned starting from a

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
description of the world in terms of a

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
random dynamical systems

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
and ending up with the description of

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,920
self-organization

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,759
as sentient behavior

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
greetings carl

117
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
all right

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
how goes it

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
um i've just managed to get back in my

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
house after being locked out by my son

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
but otherwise fine

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
you found an alternate policy approach

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
i did and some keys hiding underneath

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
the bucket

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
would you say this paper is the key to

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
the free energy principle or what is the

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
key

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,040
um

129
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
this is which ones it's this is the um

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,320
the simpler one simple as possible uh

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
made simpler but not too simple

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
ah now there are simpler ones

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
i hope there will be simpler ones so

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,639
this is

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,039
this is one route to the desired

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
simplicity

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
all right so

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
what

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,919
is this paper about

140
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
what did you intend to do and how did

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
you accomplish that in this paper

142
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,520
it was um originally conceived as

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080
a brief summary of the particular

144
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
physics paper

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
if you remember that one that's an

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
archive

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
a very dense um

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,919
hundred page

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,680
deconstruction of

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,919
physics as we know it so this was meant

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,000
to be a technical

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
rehearsal and

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,960
um

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
focusing specifically on

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
the free energy principle in the active

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
imprints part

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
and was meant to be as simple as you

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
could get it but as it was being written

159
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
it became more and more complicated so

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,319
now we're writing another one that's

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,039
even simpler

162
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
it was a technical rehearsal then it was

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
a dress rehearsal and then before you

164
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
knew it it was

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,360
um

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,600
well there's many places to jump in but

167
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
first thanks so much for joining and

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
feel free to join and leave as works for

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
you

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
we were interested at the outset with

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
the layout and the roadmap of the paper

172
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,680
so you described how

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
there's the introduction and then the

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
following sections are topically

175
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
arranged so

176
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
how did these seven

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
inner

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
sections

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
come to be

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
is that the seven islands in the

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
island chain are there other

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
topics how did you come to this order

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
and these seven sections

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,880
right are you posing the question to me

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,639
i guess blue could go for it but maybe

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
you could go first

187
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
so i can't see who else is here so i'm

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
not quite sure

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,080
um

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
who else could speak to this um

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
so from my point of view um

192
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
as the author it was exactly as you say

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,960
was the

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
stations um

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
on route from

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,560
the

197
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
basics uh or the basic assumptions of

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,479
the free energy principle which is

199
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,759
basically the

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
launch of an equation

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,400
right

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
right through to the end which is an

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
account of

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,080
uh sentient behavior meant in in a in a

205
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
very deflationary way so it was just the

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
steps that you would need to take

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
to go from um a laundromat

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
description of some system

209
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,400
through

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,039
to first of all defining

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
um

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
systems of interest that had steady

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
state solutions

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
and then further

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
thinking about the nature of thingness

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
how you would distinguish a thing from

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
uh something else and the implications

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
of that distinction as articulated with

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
a markov blanket

220
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,479
for

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,199
the

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,240
dynamics and various interpretations of

223
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
those dynamics and of course the

224
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,680
interpretation we use

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
is that of

226
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,759
self-evidencing or gradient flows

227
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,639
that

228
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
look as if they are

229
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
the kind of gradient flows you would see

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
in systems representing in a bayesian

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,039
sense um

232
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,279
the causes of their sensory inputs on

233
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,760
their markov blanket

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,120
and then looking at special classes or

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
types or kinds of particles in

236
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
particular the limiting case of large

237
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,399
particles

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
where the random fluctuations on the

239
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
particular states namely the markov

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
blanket and their

241
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
um internal states

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
uh tend to zero essentially banished so

243
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,519
such you are now describing things

244
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,519
that have a classical aspect in the

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,800
sense that they

246
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,600
um you wouldn't need a sort of

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
microscopic or quantum

248
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
description that they move and behave in

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
accord with classical or lagrangian

250
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
dynamics and that has

251
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,519
um some special put some special

252
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,680
constraints on these gradient flows

253
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,640
on

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,519
the lagrangian or the surprisal

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,920
that is being read as a gradient flow or

256
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
sharing the same minima

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
as a gradient flow on variational free

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
energy and that takes us then to the

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
final move which is

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
um

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
what that would look like in terms of

262
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
planning as inference and the

263
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
articulating that in terms of expected

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,479
free energy and then we stopped

265
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,160
awesome

266
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
blue anything to add or we can continue

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
this line

268
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
you know i have a question that that's

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
like a burning question from reading

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
this paper and listening to carl talk

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
and then also um doing the textbook

272
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
reading group

273
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
uh i'm curious about

274
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,720
the language the causes of sensory

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
inputs

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,800
so

277
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
and i'm curious about this because you

278
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
can see it in so many ways and i know

279
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
that it's open to interpretation and

280
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,880
depends upon the model of the system but

281
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,720
as someone from a neuroscience

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
background like the cause of my sensory

283
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,600
input is like a 450 nanometer light wave

284
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
or

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
um

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
a pressure wave through air in terms

287
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
you know in the sense of sound so when

288
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
you think about the cause of the sensory

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
input like

290
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
if there's a red balloon and i'm seeing

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,959
red like that's you know 700 nanometer

292
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
light wavelength that i'm i'm actually

293
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
detecting

294
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
but but the then that the balloon is

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
like missing from that and and so i just

296
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,800
wonder

297
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
why did you choose this term or do you

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
mean it in the literal sense or is it

299
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
supposed to be abstracted am i supposed

300
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
to you know come away from the cause of

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
my sense

302
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
come away from the red light and go more

303
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,600
toward that's a red balloon

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
i would come away from the red light and

305
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
go more towards the red balloon would

306
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
you excuse it for a second but the sun

307
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
that lost me out is just knocking on the

308
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,560
door because i stole his keys

309
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,480
thank you

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
move away from the red light

311
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,319
away from the red light

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
sorry about that um

313
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,880
yeah no i and so the notion or the use

314
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,519
of the language um causes

315
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,480
um

316
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
is used in a

317
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
um a very broad sense in terms of

318
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
carving up

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
all variables into causes and

320
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
consequences

321
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,760
so very often when you talk in

322
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,079
any modeling context particularly in

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,440
terms of

324
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
um the inversion of a generative model

325
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
people ask what do you mean by inversion

326
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
of a generative model well what i mean

327
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
is a generative model

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,880
is a probabilistic description

329
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,279
of the joint occurrence of causes and

330
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,639
consequences

331
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,120
and usually the consequences are

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
observable and the causes are not so the

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
sometimes referred to as hidden causes

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,880
um

335
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,760
so

336
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
the genitive model provides this um

337
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
description of the joint occurrence

338
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
probabilistic relationships between

339
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
causes and consequences

340
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
and the way that we

341
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
or the way that one can understand

342
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,959
sensations or sensory samples is as the

343
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
consequences of some abstract causes but

344
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
because the causes are hidden

345
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
and or unobservable

346
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
they can only be inferred so these

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
causes now become random variables that

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,360
can only be inferred so it's um from the

349
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
point of view of a modeler the forward

350
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
model or the generative process would be

351
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
a map from cause to consequence

352
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,040
but we only have available or at hand or

353
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
on eye

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
the consequences so we have to do the

355
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
reverse mapping which is the um genesis

356
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
of the notion of model inversion we have

357
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
to map from consequences back to causes

358
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
and that's basically the process of uh

359
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
bayesian inference so that's where the

360
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
language comes from it's just sort of

361
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
splitting every the whole universe into

362
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
two types of variables causes and

363
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,160
consequences

364
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
when you move to the free energy

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,040
principle

366
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
as articulated in the particular physics

367
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,480
paper

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
things become a little bit more nuanced

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
because now you've got the consequences

370
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,680
of external causes impressing themselves

371
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
on the mark of blanket but you now also

372
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,680
have internal states internal to the

373
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
markov blanket that are now doing the

374
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,720
bayesian model inversion effectively but

375
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
the causes are meant as a

376
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
a universal and very very high

377
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
dimensional

378
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,839
um or referred to

379
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
a

380
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
a set of very very high dimensional um

381
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
variables external states out there that

382
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
conspire

383
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
through uh whole chains of causal links

384
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
to produce the sensory consequences so i

385
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,399
would subsume both the red bloom

386
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,720
and the reflected and irradiant light

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
and all all of the

388
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
biophysics that causes your retinal cell

389
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,680
to fire i that whole chain of causality

390
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,639
will entail a whole series and possibly

391
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,079
uncountable number of um hidden causes

392
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,920
in generating the consequences and you

393
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,160
have to work back through that chain and

394
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
and hence the you know the

395
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,920
um the

396
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,720
notion of hierarchical models that

397
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
explicitly try to put that chain in

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
place so one level of your hierarchy

399
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
model you have a red balloon and another

400
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
level of the model you might have um the

401
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
the other consequences of of um that red

402
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
balloon in the outside world which would

403
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
be um you know reflected light and that

404
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,320
you know passing through your um your

405
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,560
optical machinery and impinging upon

406
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
your retina or

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
you know all of these things will be

408
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
implicitly modeled or coarse grained in

409
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
your genitive model so that you can

410
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
solve the inverse problem reconstruct

411
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
the scene out there

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
given this is how you observed it

413
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,040
because how you observed it um is

414
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,399
specified in the generative model

415
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
through a likelihood mapping so if i

416
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
knew the cause red balloon you know what

417
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
would it what would it feel like how

418
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
would i palpate it what would i observe

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,839
and that whole likelihood model would

420
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,800
entail all the mechanisms that you know

421
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
you described as a sound waves and

422
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
pressure waves and uh

423
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
and photons and the like uh just to

424
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
conclude

425
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
another common word or phrase people use

426
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
certainly machine learning for this

427
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,519
notion of causes that are unobservable

428
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,120
that they are effectively random

429
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
variables because they are the support

430
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
of a generative model which is specified

431
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,600
as a probability distribution is hidden

432
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
states another word for this is latent

433
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
states and i've been told off by some

434
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
reviewers for using the word latent

435
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
states but i can't remember why so i've

436
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
i've reverted to this using them in

437
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,519
exactly the same sense that latent

438
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,680
states or hidden states

439
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
are those unobservable variables

440
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,079
um that are distinguished between from

441
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,800
observable states or outcomes or um

442
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
measurements or or or data

443
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
so that's where the language comes from

444
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,880
that's very helpful

445
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
yeah it really helps me um because it's

446
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
something that i've struggled with but

447
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
to think about it a hidden cause in

448
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
terms of a causal chain

449
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
that leads to the observation that

450
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,160
that's a very helpful um way for me to

451
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
think about it thank you

452
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,000
good yeah and also how hierarchical

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
nesting of models which we can come back

454
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
to it's like one model might be the

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,079
unobserved is the temperature in the

456
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
room and the observation is the number

457
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
on the thermometer but you don't really

458
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
see the number you see the light so then

459
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,080
you could have a two step model where

460
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
the causes of the temperature

461
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
are the

462
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
shape of the thermometer and then the

463
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,799
shape of the thermometer is what number

464
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
it is and so depending on how much data

465
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
and the adequacy that's needed

466
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
one could coarse grain and just say

467
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
we're going to go from the hidden state

468
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
to the observed inferred number or can

469
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,080
start to parse that if there were

470
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,439
degrees of freedom there

471
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
let's maybe go through oh did you do

472
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
could say that's a nice example but you

473
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,160
know you could have a sort of

474
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
a deep

475
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,919
artifact or personal creature with your

476
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,360
actually has the representation of

477
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,679
temperature as a cause of the shape or

478
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,520
the height of the thermometer or you

479
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
could have a very um shallow artifact

480
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
that just registers the height of the

481
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
thermometer and i have in mind here the

482
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,799
difference between a thermostat and me

483
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,760
or you so we would know that you know we

484
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
would represent and explain changes in

485
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
the shape

486
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,799
um in terms of a change in temperature

487
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,720
because that's our model and we would

488
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
have a deep model but the thermostat

489
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,880
might not it might directly act upon the

490
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
world simply because the shape you know

491
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
there is some quantitative single valued

492
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
scalar

493
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
observable that is telling it to switch

494
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
the radiator on so it's a nice

495
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
distinction you know there's no rule

496
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
which says how how much course training

497
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
or how

498
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,600
much depth or hierarchical structure

499
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,240
you uh bring to the table in terms of

500
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
trying to explain what you can observe

501
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
great let's go to

502
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
quite early in the discussion in the

503
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
introduction

504
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
um

505
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,200
elsewhere

506
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
the tautology in the top logical aspects

507
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
and the falsification have been explored

508
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
so let's jump into a slightly different

509
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,400
point which is the utility

510
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,360
so there is a rhetoric in the paper is

511
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,039
such a description

512
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,880
of the fep

513
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
being in this framework or

514
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
principle-like way

515
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,960
and

516
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
the answer was probably no

517
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
but there was a however

518
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
so where do you see the utility of the

519
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
fep and how does that come into play

520
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
in the particulars

521
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,280
for carl or blue maybe to you first

522
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
blue goes first yes blue where have you

523
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,960
seen utility in the fep

524
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,840
i like that the fep

525
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
resolves so many

526
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,159
very difficult things to model or

527
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
maybe doesn't resolve it fully yet but

528
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
has the potential to resolve is maybe a

529
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,880
better way to put it um especially in

530
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,840
terms of hierarchical modeling

531
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,799
also

532
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,440
the balance between exploration and

533
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,280
exploitation complexity and accuracy

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
so i think that it's useful to

535
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
describe circumstances where

536
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,679
there's not always a single solution but

537
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
but maybe um

538
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
a best solution

539
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
or how can we find the best solution

540
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,240
given what we know

541
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
okay

542
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,080
what would you say carl where what was

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,799
the function of this example

544
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,760
with

545
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
the principle of least action which

546
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
we'll also want to explore but

547
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,880
how is their utility in the fep

548
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
how is their utility in the principle of

549
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
least action and what is their

550
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
relationship between fep and the

551
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
principle of leased action

552
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
i think that uh blue uh you know has

553
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
provided the answer um

554
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
and it can be illustrated with

555
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,840
hamilton's principal release principle

556
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
of least action so

557
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
if i

558
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,360
wanted to understand um how a ball um

559
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,919
was thrown or understand its dynamics

560
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,679
since kinetics and it's you know the

561
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
laws the physical laws

562
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,520
by which a ball or a massive uh body uh

563
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,840
pursued a particular trajectory

564
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,080
then what i could do is to apply

565
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,480
hamilton's principle of least action

566
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
to the particulars of this situation the

567
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
mass of the ball the initial conditions

568
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
the um the wind resistance and

569
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
everything else that i would need to

570
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
know

571
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
in order to predict the behavior and

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
understand the mechanics that underwrote

573
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
what actually unfolded

574
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,799
so um if you sort of dumb down

575
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
blues

576
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
aspiration to understand sentient

577
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
creatures and and

578
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
uh you know

579
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
the distinction or the relationship

580
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
between exploration and exploitation and

581
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,799
just think about understanding the

582
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,880
trajectory of massive bodies what you

583
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
will end up doing is appealing to

584
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,919
a principle of least action and all that

585
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,640
says is these prescribe

586
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
the

587
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
um the lawful behaviors

588
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
if you apply that principle to a

589
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,960
particular situation so for us as

590
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
builders of um sentient artifacts or

591
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,440
neuroscientists um trying to understand

592
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
um sentient creatures

593
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
what it says is that you have a

594
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
principle at hand that allows you to

595
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
build

596
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,799
and if you can build an artifact that

597
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,120
either resembles or reproduces the kind

598
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
of behaviors that you're interested in

599
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
studying then you have a more formal

600
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
understanding of the mechanics and how

601
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,400
those

602
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,159
how those artifacts or systems that

603
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,799
actually operate or you can simulate um

604
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,120
or you can build um

605
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
um artificial intelligence

606
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
systems you know so

607
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
it's all in the pragmatic building of

608
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
something

609
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,120
by applying

610
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,440
the free energy principle to something

611
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
and you may be asking what is that

612
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
something well it's a generative model

613
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,559
so all the hard work starts

614
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,320
not in understanding or deploying the

615
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
free energy principle you know it's all

616
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
the hard work is really specifying

617
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
writing down the generative model apt to

618
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
describe the kind of creature you're

619
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
interested in or that you're the the

620
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
system

621
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,120
um you're trying to characterize and

622
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
understand i'll just close by

623
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
um

624
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,679
nodding to or giving a nod to richard

625
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,039
feynman here because that that whole um

626
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
the motivation for application of the

627
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
png principle and in a sense the

628
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
motivation for the free energy principle

629
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,000
in and of itself

630
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
was just to

631
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,960
um

632
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,320
realize or provide tools for realizing

633
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
the

634
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
observation that was famously or

635
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
purportedly on his blackboard at the

636
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
time of his depth that if you can't

637
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,039
build something if you can't create it

638
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,279
you can't understand it so to build it

639
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,440
is to understand it and vice versa

640
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,960
great

641
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
um i'll ask one follow-up on findman and

642
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,520
then we have a great question in the

643
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
chat

644
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,480
what is variational inference as feynman

645
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
utilized it and as it's utilized in fep

646
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
and active

647
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,240
right well variational inference

648
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,400
is generally read as

649
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
a suite of

650
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
data analytic tools called variational

651
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
bays

652
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
that used to always also be called

653
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
ensemble learning but i haven't heard

654
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,840
that phrase um in in the recent years so

655
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,919
what is variational base well it's um a

656
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,799
form of approximate bayesian inference

657
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,600
um which should be contrasted with exact

658
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
bayesian inference so what's the

659
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
difference between approximate and exact

660
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,440
bayesian inference the key difference is

661
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,559
that you

662
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,520
assume a functional form

663
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,480
for

664
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,039
the posterior beliefs that you're trying

665
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,080
to

666
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,120
update from your priors to the posterior

667
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,600
beliefs now in assuming a functional

668
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
form

669
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,120
you are going to depart from the actual

670
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
true posterior and it's that departure

671
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,880
which renders the inference scheme an

672
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
approximate bayesian inference scheme

673
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
but what you buy

674
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
for that approximation

675
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
is tractability

676
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,919
so exact bayesian influence cannot be

677
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,720
realized physically

678
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
by which i mean it's mathematically

679
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
intractable

680
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,440
and also numerically impossible to do

681
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,559
exactly

682
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,679
even if you have enormous sampling and

683
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,600
you use sampling based procedures like

684
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
metropolis hastings or

685
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
gibbs sampling

686
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,080
just open brackets is another way of

687
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,880
approximating a post area just with lots

688
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
of some with a large

689
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
number of samples and sample density

690
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,559
so

691
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
what what what's what's the fundamental

692
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,159
importance of the move from exact basin

693
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,919
influence to approximate bayesian

694
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,440
inference namely variational inference

695
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
it's because you've assumed a functional

696
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
form which makes your inference

697
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
approximate

698
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,520
you can now

699
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,039
analytically

700
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,760
convert what is an impossible

701
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,799
marginalization or integration problem

702
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,840
uh into a tractable

703
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,400
optimization problem so just put some

704
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,320
flesh on that um

705
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,679
if you wanted to use um if you wanted

706
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,200
well let's take richard feynman's

707
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,080
problem

708
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
he was trying to work out the

709
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
probability distributions over

710
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,679
all the paths a small particle could

711
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
take from some initial state to some

712
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,279
final state

713
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,320
now

714
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,480
given the nature of the paths he had in

715
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,919
mind

716
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
there is a universe of an an enormous

717
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
and countable number of such paths

718
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,360
which meant that any um either analytic

719
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
or numerical realization of these paths

720
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
meant that the it was impossible

721
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
to

722
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
normalize the distribution by

723
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
marginalizing or integrating over the

724
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,919
distribution to work out the

725
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,320
normalization constant also known as a

726
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
partition function which you would need

727
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,200
in order to specify the probability

728
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,480
distribution

729
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,559
so when people talk about an intractable

730
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,960
marginalization or integration problem

731
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,799
what they mean is for very high

732
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,080
dimensional probabilities it is

733
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
you cannot

734
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
integrate under the unnormalized

735
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
distribution to produce a probability

736
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,120
distribution however

737
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
if you know the functional form

738
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,679
then you can create

739
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
what's called an evidence bound

740
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,240
or a variational free energy

741
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,840
which is always

742
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,799
um

743
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,520
for a physicist always greater than

744
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
the

745
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,559
um

746
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,520
the

747
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,440
the quantity that you want to estimate

748
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
or marginalize

749
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
the the the evidence

750
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
that constitutes the result of that

751
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,520
marginalization also called the marginal

752
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
likelihood

753
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,159
which means if you can reduce that bound

754
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,679
you're guaranteed to find the minima

755
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,880
that is um always greater than the thing

756
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
you actually want to minimize which is

757
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,399
usually the negative log marginal

758
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,000
likelihood

759
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
which converts an impossible integration

760
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
problem into tractable optimization

761
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
problem and that's conceptually quite

762
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,919
important

763
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
so what it means is that you

764
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,399
are now converting

765
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,159
effectively an inference problem an

766
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
exact base in inference problem

767
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,279
into an optimization scheme so now you

768
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,760
have a formal definition of um the

769
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
normative account of behavior you can

770
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,440
now talk about inference as an

771
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,840
optimization procedure where you're

772
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
optimizing a well-defined objective

773
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
function that is the variation of

774
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,159
freehand and why variational well very

775
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,760
simply

776
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
given the functional form

777
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
of your approximate posterior

778
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,320
and given the functional form of the

779
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,640
bound um on the marginal likelihood or

780
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,399
the negative log marginal likelihood to

781
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,760
be more precise

782
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,679
and you then use

783
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,480
the calculus of variations

784
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,200
to demonstrate that this is indeed a

785
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,000
band and thereby you can perform a

786
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,559
gradient descent or you can find the

787
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,520
minima

788
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,279
analytically

789
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,440
as part of that optimization scheme so

790
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,279
the variational base just means you're

791
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,720
using the calculus of variations

792
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,520
to

793
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,600
um

794
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
license the use of

795
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
a particular approximation to the

796
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
posterior

797
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,600
excellent

798
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,960
welcome thomas thank you for joining

799
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
would you like to

800
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
say hi or give any overview i can

801
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,240
continue with the question or please

802
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
feel free to take it in any direction

803
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
um well thank you for inviting me um

804
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,480
i i don't have any particular comments

805
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
at the moment because unfortunately i

806
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
missed the start of it apologies that i

807
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
joined late um

808
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,600
perfect well

809
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
i'll go to the question that was in the

810
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
chat so this was

811
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,960
asked by jax in relationship to our

812
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,039
discussion about the balloon example and

813
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,519
the thermometer example with hidden

814
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,399
causes and observed consequences

815
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
is this all in the service of

816
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,679
homeostasis

817
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,279
so how can we connect what we've been

818
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,320
talking about with this causal bayesian

819
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,519
framework

820
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
and the variational inference to the

821
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,159
idea of homeostasis and survival for

822
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,720
cognitive entities

823
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,279
as per tradition we could go to blue

824
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
or thomas if you'd like to jump in on

825
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
that

826
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
no please go ahead

827
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,760
you have to give thomas a few minutes to

828
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
settle in

829
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
yes

830
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,559
i'm deflecting that question back to you

831
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
so you've judged every question so far

832
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,320
today so we're going to let daniel

833
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,159
answer this one

834
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,000
sure

835
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,039
so just to give a first thought

836
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,000
so we just heard about how variational

837
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,799
free energy calculation is converting an

838
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,559
impossible integration problem to

839
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,440
attractable optimization and a gradient

840
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,679
descent that's through time

841
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,960
and so

842
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,039
if we were trying to stay within

843
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,399
homeostatic bounds for temperature or

844
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,880
for blood sugar or some other vital

845
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,000
parameter

846
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
and we found ourselves anywhere but

847
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,279
exactly on the one target location so

848
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,840
we're some divergence away from a set

849
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
point

850
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,240
the number of paths that we could take

851
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
back to get to our set point or to get

852
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,440
to the

853
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,200
range of comfort

854
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,279
just like feynman's particles the number

855
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
of pods we could take would be infinite

856
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,799
like in the blood sugar example you

857
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,960
could change the regulation of every

858
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
single gene in every single possible

859
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,360
combination so the number of paths and

860
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,120
microstates would be very large

861
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,919
variational inference and planning as

862
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,039
inference

863
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,519
would give us a way to

864
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,279
in an unfolding through time way

865
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,000
functionally optimize and return to

866
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
homeostasis

867
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,120
rather than waiting on the sideline for

868
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
this intractable

869
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
integration to occur

870
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,120
we could start moving in a direction

871
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
that's more like a ball rolling to the

872
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,480
bottom of a hill

873
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,880
or like a molecule descending to a gibbs

874
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,039
free energy attractor

875
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,480
but in some

876
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
other space

877
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,039
that we're doing inference in

878
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,600
maybe blue next

879
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,360
we'll go from least knowledge to most

880
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,519
because um

881
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,600
i don't know homeostasis i think there's

882
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,399
always um

883
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,880
so we started off by saying

884
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
um

885
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,159
what exists or if you exist what must

886
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
you do right like so the paper starts

887
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,399
off saying this way so if something

888
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,360
exists what does it what must it do

889
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,519
rather must what must something do in

890
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,120
order to exist so it starts with the

891
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
reverse of this and i think homeostasis

892
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
is like the most

893
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
driving

894
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,679
force behind life

895
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
which goes back to the life as we know

896
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,879
it paper

897
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,520
and also a particular physics

898
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
so so what must something do in order to

899
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,199
exist something biological must maintain

900
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,520
this non-equilibrium steady state

901
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,079
density of homeostasis because if you

902
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
don't then you die so equilibrium in a

903
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,399
living system is death

904
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,320
and so fundamentally i think that

905
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
it does come back to

906
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,440
homeostasis um

907
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,440
yes

908
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,638
thomas

909
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,119
sure i i think i've got my bearings now

910
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,239
um

911
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,920
so

912
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
i think homeostasis is always quite an

913
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,359
interesting

914
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
comparison with or thinking to relate

915
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,440
back to variational inference and the

916
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,960
free energy principle

917
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,520
um and i think for me part of the reason

918
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
for that is that homeostasis is really

919
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
just the observation that sense of

920
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,599
values tend to live in some particular

921
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,200
space over time or some particular

922
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,720
distribution

923
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,160
and so it's more

924
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
when you talk about homostatic bounds

925
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
what we're talking about really are just

926
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
um

927
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
the

928
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,440
description of how things tend to be

929
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
um

930
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
and

931
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
coming back to this question about

932
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,720
inverting this question of how how

933
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,200
things have to exist and going

934
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
in reverse and saying well it does exist

935
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,200
and it exists in this form how does it

936
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,320
then do it

937
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
um

938
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
we're sort of starting when we talk

939
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,280
about homostasis from the principle that

940
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,359
we are in this range and traditionally

941
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
you then talk about negative feedback

942
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
type mechanisms reflexive

943
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,920
um correction of deviations from some

944
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,200
set point

945
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
but you could also see that as exactly

946
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,160
the process of

947
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,400
um maintaining some steady state density

948
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,160
over time of climbing probability

949
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
gradients exactly as you would for

950
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,839
a

951
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,520
variational inference

952
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
um

953
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,839
and

954
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
when you look at things in that

955
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
framing then and and particularly

956
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
because in homeostasis we're normally

957
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
using sensor values whether those be

958
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,560
vary receptors or

959
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
um measures of

960
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,800
glucose control and sorry blood glucose

961
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
and that sort of thing

962
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
and we're really dealing with a

963
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
probability distribution over some sort

964
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,400
of sensory data here predominantly

965
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
interceptive data

966
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
um which

967
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
is effectively a marginal likelihood

968
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,599
once you then equip it with a model of

969
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,320
how those sensor variables are are

970
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
generated

971
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,079
and so one of the things that's useful

972
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
in terms of taking it from homeostasis

973
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,800
to variational inference or putting it

974
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
in the realm of the free energy

975
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
principle is it then asks you to

976
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
try to formulate the sort of generative

977
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,920
model you'd need

978
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,839
to be able to explain those data and

979
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,240
therefore to to

980
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
optimize your your own internal

981
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,079
environment

982
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,079
um and that's i think where a lot of the

983
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,400
interesting neuroscience comes in where

984
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
you try to build the models that the

985
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
brain might use

986
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,800
um and then invert as the process of

987
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
performing autonomic reflexes and the

988
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
like

989
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,640
one

990
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,000
thank you

991
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
carl anything to ask or we can continue

992
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,079
with other questions

993
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
no i did just very briefly just to

994
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,599
reinforce the last two answers you know

995
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,359
the question is an excellent question

996
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,800
because in a sense the free energy

997
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,119
principle is just about describing

998
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,800
things that have a generalized

999
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,480
homeostasis

1000
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
so it's not saying how would you

1001
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
implement homeostasis it's saying that

1002
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
our universe seems to be populated with

1003
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,680
things that possess a homeostasis so

1004
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
what behaviors must they what principles

1005
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
must they conform to

1006
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
so you know it's a

1007
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,880
a very good question

1008
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
in this notion of

1009
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
generalization

1010
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,920
we just heard generalized homeostasis

1011
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
and i'd like to ask how it's connected

1012
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,839
to two other generalized

1013
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,880
generalized synchrony and generalized

1014
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,920
coordinates of motion

1015
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,960
and if there's any other generalizations

1016
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
we can add those but

1017
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,760
how might this notion of generalized

1018
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,839
homeostasis

1019
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,880
be related to generalized synchrony

1020
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,440
for one entity or in communicating

1021
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,880
ensembles

1022
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
and then the notion of generalized

1023
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,359
coordinates of motion

1024
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,440
shall i take that one

1025
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
sure

1026
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,599
um well sure i take that one first i

1027
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,040
think there's a very close relationship

1028
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
between the notion of generalized

1029
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,240
synchrony and the notion of a

1030
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,440
homeostasis um and by generalizing i

1031
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,359
just mean the same tendency to keep

1032
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,920
states that matter sometimes referred to

1033
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,520
as essential variables in the

1034
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,920
cybernetics literature within certain

1035
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
bounds or within viable domains

1036
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,359
if you wanted to describe that process

1037
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,640
as a

1038
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,520
systems dynamical systems theory what

1039
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
you would be saying is that the

1040
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,079
trajectories through some state space

1041
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,760
are limited to a relatively small

1042
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,400
attracting set and the smallness of that

1043
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,320
attracting set um defines the bounds or

1044
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
the range that characterizes that

1045
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,960
particular system so um for you and i we

1046
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
have quite narrow bound say on our

1047
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
temperature um

1048
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,440
and that just means that our dynamics

1049
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
keeps us within or close to

1050
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
those set points um so from the point of

1051
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,680
view of the

1052
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,160
um the dynamicist

1053
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,599
understanding

1054
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,880
the the

1055
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
dynamical behavior of two systems that

1056
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
are coupled to each other these can

1057
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,079
either be

1058
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,440
um

1059
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
a creature or a particle and it's

1060
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
embedding niche or environment or the

1061
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
external states or there could be two um

1062
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
similar uh particles in dyadic

1063
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,079
interaction

1064
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,119
the way that if they are coupled and

1065
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,760
they are both restricted to a small step

1066
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
set of states or paths at the um

1067
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,640
relative to the the total number of

1068
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,480
states or paths that they could

1069
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
pursue or occupy

1070
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,160
then they're said to have a generalized

1071
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,440
synchrony um technically it means that i

1072
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,480
can predict how i will move

1073
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,079
given your state and vice versa

1074
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,400
so i think there is a very close formal

1075
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,680
relationship between the notion of

1076
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,599
generalized synchrony and um and

1077
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,800
homeostasis of the kind that is uh

1078
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
accountable to the coupling between um

1079
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,400
one system and another system

1080
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
generalized course of motion

1081
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,599
um i think um are meant in a slightly

1082
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,079
more technical sense so in order to

1083
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,000
understand the dynamics

1084
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,720
so to move from a description of things

1085
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
in terms of where they are in some state

1086
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,280
space say your temperature and now to

1087
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
understand the processes that keep you

1088
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,640
at a certain temperature then you have

1089
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,040
to talk about the rate of change of

1090
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
temperature or the paths

1091
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,599
in a state space where one dimensional

1092
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,040
coordinate of that state space is

1093
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,079
temperature

1094
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,720
so how would you describe mathematically

1095
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
paths well you could just have a long

1096
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
list of

1097
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
states as an increasing function of time

1098
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
or there's a more compact way of

1099
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,800
describing a path

1100
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,040
which is effectively to use a taylor

1101
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,240
expansion

1102
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,800
and and describe it with a list of

1103
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
coefficients of that taylor expansion

1104
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
which turn out to be

1105
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,599
the state you're in at the moment

1106
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,200
your velocity

1107
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,560
your acceleration your jerk and all

1108
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,880
higher order temporal derivatives

1109
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,359
and if you go to an infinite number of

1110
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,119
temporal derivatives you can now

1111
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,079
reconstruct using that taylor expansion

1112
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,560
your trajectory into the future and into

1113
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,960
the past so generalized coordinates of

1114
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
motion are just the observation that you

1115
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,359
have to in describing or most precisely

1116
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,599
in defining the support of a

1117
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,640
probabilistic description of a system

1118
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,520
if you want to describe the paths then

1119
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
you just

1120
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,160
augment the state with all its higher

1121
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,839
order uh

1122
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
temporal derivatives

1123
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,720
and that's called generalized um

1124
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,319
coordinates of motion

1125
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,480
interestingly should be slightly

1126
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,520
disambiguated from the way that people

1127
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,319
use generalized coordinates um in

1128
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,359
physics

1129
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,000
so that's usually read as basically

1130
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
thinking about a complete description of

1131
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
the system just in terms of the first

1132
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,079
the state and its first order temporal

1133
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,000
derivative so you'll come across for

1134
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,560
example in um

1135
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
mechanics um

1136
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,480
p and q so

1137
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,119
momentum and position um

1138
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,440
so uh if you're in quantum physics

1139
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,720
you'll be dealing with real and

1140
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,920
imaginary parts of your particular

1141
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,880
variable

1142
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,560
um or a probability distribution um

1143
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,960
the the important observation here is

1144
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,119
that you've got more than one variable

1145
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,839
to describe what's going on uh and this

1146
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,839
if you like is the simplest kind of

1147
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,520
generalized points of motions is

1148
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,319
basically x and x prime or rate of

1149
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,040
change of x or x dot but you can extend

1150
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,079
that notion and infinite uh to create a

1151
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,760
hilbert space or an interdimensional

1152
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,400
space where one point in this infinite

1153
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,480
dimensional space

1154
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,119
encodes or stands in for mathematically

1155
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,400
represents an entire trajectory or or

1156
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,720
path and that's a formalism that in fact

1157
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
the free energy principle is actually

1158
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
articulated in in terms of um path

1159
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,400
integral formulations

1160
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,960
awesome

1161
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,319
thomas would you like to add anything

1162
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,160
there

1163
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,000
it's difficult to know what to add in

1164
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,160
such a comprehensive description

1165
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,040
um

1166
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,440
i suppose one thing i'd pick up on this

1167
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,599
um and perhaps this is more a question

1168
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,920
for carl but um you mentioned the idea

1169
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,160
that taylor expansion is a more compact

1170
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,560
way of describing the trajectory

1171
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
um i was wondering whether that's

1172
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
necessarily true i appreciate it would

1173
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,839
be if the trajectory is relatively

1174
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,280
simple um but

1175
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,599
you you could argue that you need a very

1176
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,839
large number of taylor coefficients to

1177
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,760
be able to adequately describe a more

1178
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,599
complex trajectory

1179
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,640
um complex in the sense of non-linear

1180
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,720
and whereas a

1181
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
um

1182
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,440
whereas it may be simpler in some

1183
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
circumstances just to have a series of

1184
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,640
discrete temporal points

1185
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,560
yep excellent question so yeah so

1186
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,240
you know it speaks to

1187
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,160
when i when i or people like me talk

1188
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,880
about compact we're sort of

1189
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,640
implicit in that

1190
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,319
statement is the notion of some

1191
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,119
truncation um and certainly one

1192
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
truncation of the kind uh you just

1193
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,599
mentioned would be um having a discrete

1194
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,359
set of points but if you wanted to

1195
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,079
represent the entire path

1196
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,400
you're obliged to

1197
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,640
write down an infinite number of numbers

1198
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,400
you can either write an infinite number

1199
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
of states as

1200
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,960
time moves forward or backwards or you

1201
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,640
can write down an infinite number of

1202
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,800
taylor taylor coefficients or

1203
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,760
generalized coordinates of motion

1204
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,119
so

1205
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,800
you certainly generalized course of

1206
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,960
motion in and of themselves

1207
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,400
don't afford any compactness but the

1208
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
when you when you actually apply these

1209
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,240
different kinds of representations uh

1210
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,160
practically speaking

1211
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,280
then

1212
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
there are two kinds of truncations that

1213
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
now um

1214
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,680
present themselves if you're dealing

1215
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,000
with continuous time trajectories so

1216
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,240
that your path is now described as a

1217
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,800
function of time you normally have to

1218
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,520
truncate it by specifying t equals zero

1219
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,000
and some horizon in the future you know

1220
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,319
the initial and the final state so

1221
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,160
there's a choice there that you have to

1222
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,119
make in order to deal um practically or

1223
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,319
numerically indeed in some instances

1224
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,599
analytically

1225
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,119
with a path by truncating its length in

1226
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,000
time

1227
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
the equivalent truncation in generalized

1228
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,079
coins of motion is in terms of a

1229
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,319
discrete bound or upper limit on the

1230
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,000
number of the um the number of the uh

1231
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
generalized coordinates or order of the

1232
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,480
temporal derivatives the nice thing the

1233
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,480
compactness um

1234
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,760
comes

1235
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
in generalized coordinates in that

1236
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
there's a natural

1237
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,640
there's a natural

1238
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
space in which you can do that

1239
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,560
truncation and that comes from the fact

1240
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,359
that as you increase the order of the

1241
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,599
temporal derivatives or the order of the

1242
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,160
uh generalized coordinates of motion

1243
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,280
because

1244
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,240
the

1245
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,599
variance of the random fluctuations

1246
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,240
on the higher order motion

1247
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,200
gets

1248
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,480
large very very quickly

1249
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,640
you can um assume that after a certain

1250
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,119
number of generalized coordinates or

1251
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,839
orders of generalized quants of motion

1252
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,640
the precision is effectively zero

1253
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,040
so that means that you can get away

1254
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,160
with in describing an infinitely long

1255
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,760
trajectory

1256
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,640
with

1257
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,800
a small number of generalized

1258
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,720
coordinates because there's no further

1259
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,520
information in the higher orders so it

1260
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,559
now becomes like a local uh description

1261
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,920
but

1262
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,359
and in that locality um

1263
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,040
it um

1264
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,240
it becomes compact in the same way that

1265
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
you would discreetly

1266
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,559
change the length of the time series or

1267
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,040
the path um in a sort of

1268
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,559
in a function of time formulation um so

1269
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,920
practically what tends to happen um and

1270
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,280
it has to happen in the sense that the

1271
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,359
random fluctuations have to be fast

1272
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,359
therefore they have quite a narrow

1273
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,880
autocorrelation function and that um

1274
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,160
the shape of the autocorrelation

1275
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,640
function determines how quickly the

1276
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,720
precision of higher order motion

1277
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,880
decreases so generally speaking um even

1278
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,559
for quite smooth random fluctuations um

1279
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,559
you don't need or generalize orders of

1280
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,200
motion beyond about four to six orders

1281
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,839
of motion so just practically speaking

1282
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,240
um then you now have a compact

1283
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,319
representation but in doing that

1284
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,680
truncation

1285
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,599
you now can no longer

1286
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,440
roll out the path using the taylor

1287
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,480
approximation to t equals infinity

1288
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,119
you can only roll it out

1289
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,680
with confidence for a for a relatively

1290
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,319
shorter period of time it's not defined

1291
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,559
precisely because of course you're

1292
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,000
you're defining it probabilistically

1293
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,599
because you've got random fluctuations

1294
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,880
in play

1295
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
so it has a sort of soft locality

1296
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
associated with it but only when you do

1297
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,160
the truncation

1298
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,640
awesome

1299
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,319
i'll ask a follow-up on the taylor

1300
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,440
series

1301
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,839
especially in spm

1302
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,319
the statistical parametric mapping

1303
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,240
there's discussion of the volterra

1304
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,680
series so what is the volterra series

1305
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,960
how is it different from the taylor

1306
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
series

1307
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,240
and what

1308
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,959
are they doing

1309
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,079
does blue want to take the social thomas

1310
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,240
again

1311
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,400
i i can have a go but i think that's a

1312
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,000
bit before my time being involved with

1313
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,119
spm on the whole and

1314
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,119
as i understand it it's more a

1315
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,280
kernel-based representation of dynamics

1316
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,319
where

1317
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,640
you're looking at convolution um with

1318
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,240
particular kernels over time as an

1319
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,119
expression of how dynamics might evolve

1320
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,480
beyond that i think i'll probably have

1321
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,640
to refer back to carl to to answer that

1322
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
one in any detail

1323
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,760
and let's go

1324
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,599
i'm asking to understand a little bit of

1325
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,440
the history of the movement from

1326
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,760
focusing on the taylor and the volterra

1327
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,480
to only seeing the taylor series in the

1328
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,839
current paper we're discussing

1329
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,040
so but thomas is uh absolutely right the

1330
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,440
the volterra series is a way of

1331
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,720
describing um

1332
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,920
convolution operators that are an

1333
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,480
equivalent description of your equations

1334
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,240
of motion in terms of convolutional

1335
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,559
kernels of increasingly high order uh

1336
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,880
but daniel you're you're also absolutely

1337
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,520
right um implicitly

1338
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,480
in the sense that a volterra

1339
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,160
kernel expansion

1340
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,680
just is

1341
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,720
a functional taylor approximation to any

1342
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,200
given dynamical system

1343
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,240
so

1344
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,680
what's the difference between a taylor

1345
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,960
expansion of a path of a function

1346
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,640
and a functional

1347
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
a functional

1348
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,960
approximation and it

1349
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,480
it just

1350
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,079
it's using exactly the same technology

1351
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,520
but now um exp

1352
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,599
expanding the uh or applying the taylor

1353
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,240
approximation to the equations of motion

1354
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,839
so the functions

1355
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,240
that determine the flow of the system so

1356
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,000
you're applying a taylor approximation

1357
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,400
to the flow operators or the equations

1358
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,720
of motion but the spirit of the

1359
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,319
expansion is exactly the same as a

1360
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,839
standard uh taylor expansion um

1361
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,520
i don't think we need to know much more

1362
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,599
about it really in the sense that um

1363
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,000
the volterra series expansion is another

1364
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,440
way of providing a compact description

1365
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
compact in the sense you truncate the

1366
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
taylor expansion um

1367
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,200
in the same way we were just describing

1368
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,119
truncating the order of generalized

1369
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,839
coordinates of motion to get a compact

1370
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,640
representation and in some instances a

1371
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,480
compact um

1372
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,000
inversion scheme so normally um when

1373
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,599
people actually apply and certainly as

1374
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,319
we apply in a practical data analysis

1375
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,599
context volterra series we generally

1376
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,240
don't worry about um very high order

1377
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,000
terms and in fact all our subway is

1378
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,839
written just to deal with first and

1379
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,359
second order terms so we actually stop

1380
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,839
at the second order um second order

1381
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,559
derivatives or functional derivatives um

1382
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,200
which is you know even simpler than

1383
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,399
the uh you know

1384
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,000
stopping at the fourth on the sixth

1385
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,800
order in terms of expressing the

1386
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,640
original variables in generalized

1387
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,559
coordinates of motion

1388
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,079
but because it's really a device

1389
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,119
um

1390
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,079
that just re-represents

1391
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,280
a

1392
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,040
differential equation

1393
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,240
in terms of convolution operators and

1394
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,400
kernels it doesn't really get you

1395
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,240
anywhere in terms of understanding the

1396
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,800
mechanics or the theory behind it so

1397
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,400
there is nothing in the free energy

1398
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,480
principle that refers to

1399
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,040
the volterra series expansion but you

1400
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,680
could always um derive a monterey series

1401
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,760
expansion and the implicit kernels to a

1402
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,400
certain order given some differential

1403
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,839
equations um that you know at hand and

1404
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,400
if those differential equations are

1405
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,760
doing a

1406
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,880
um

1407
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,440
a gradient descent on free energy such

1408
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,280
as in a bayesian filter you could always

1409
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,559
articulate a bayesian filter in terms of

1410
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,359
a convolution operator um

1411
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,440
you know which might be one way of

1412
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,559
understanding um you know how bayesian

1413
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,839
smoothing and basin filtering

1414
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,400
operates

1415
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,440
awesome

1416
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,599
we're deconvolving

1417
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,440
and adding action

1418
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,680
in many many layers and adding more

1419
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,559
depth to the deconvolution

1420
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,800
and to the planning and inference

1421
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,200
so speaking of convolution no i have a

1422
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,640
follow-up question that's maybe a little

1423
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,480
bit convoluted or hopefully i can

1424
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,800
articulate articulate it well

1425
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,119
so when we're talking about in in the

1426
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,440
very beginning of the paper um

1427
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,359
you talk about the focker planck

1428
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,040
equation and then you talk about the

1429
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,839
path integral formation and the the

1430
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,640
focus focker plank encompasses

1431
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,359
random fluctuations and then the path

1432
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,680
integral formulation uh encompasses the

1433
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,240
trajectory right of a particle and we

1434
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,920
talked about or you talked about the

1435
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,200
like fast

1436
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,280
path and the slow path and the focker

1437
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,520
focker plank is fast and then the path

1438
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,040
integral is slow

1439
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,520
so i just want to kind of try to wrap my

1440
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,000
mind around what happens

1441
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,040
like for

1442
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,680
atoms inside of my cells okay there the

1443
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,760
the density is over states like the

1444
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,000
atoms can occupy excited states or or

1445
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,079
any number of states

1446
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,760
but the cells are are really the ones

1447
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,520
doing the work the m the motion is

1448
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,280
happening inside of cells so that's kind

1449
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,640
of the slow

1450
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,920
um

1451
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,280
the slow procedure right the path

1452
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,200
integral path but then when you think

1453
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,520
about the cells they're in my body so

1454
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,520
the cells then are occupying the states

1455
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,359
and i'm doing the moving around so then

1456
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,680
i'm on the trajectory uh um and

1457
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,480
similarly like i am in any number of

1458
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,640
states with all the rest of the humans

1459
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,280
on planet earth all in any number of

1460
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,799
like we could be any number of places

1461
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,640
but they're all on planet earth and then

1462
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,720
planet earth is moving at a slower

1463
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,920
trajectory so what is the math kind of

1464
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,240
or can can you guess or or maybe

1465
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,200
foreshadow how the map

1466
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,040
compresses or

1467
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,079
unfolds in this kind of hierarchical

1468
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,720
situation

1469
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,319
so thomas has to answer that one and he

1470
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,160
has to use the word renormalization

1471
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,280
group

1472
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,520
i thought you might say that

1473
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,960
i was going to try and do it without but

1474
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,480
now that you've said that

1475
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:22,760
um

1476
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,559
[Music]

1477
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,799
so

1478
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,040
just to

1479
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,720
to start with i mean you you you

1480
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,359
mentioned the the this problem

1481
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,520
to start with in the context of the

1482
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,599
focal plank equation and the path

1483
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,079
integral formulations and and looking at

1484
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,760
that sort of distinction

1485
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,119
and

1486
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,480
which i think is

1487
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,400
is interesting when thinking about fast

1488
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,599
and slow um but it is to some extent

1489
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,520
orthogonal i think it's interesting when

1490
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,200
thinking about fast and slow um in that

1491
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,480
you you might expect that the

1492
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,520
the focal point equation describing the

1493
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,440
um rate of change or the evolution of

1494
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,520
some probability density

1495
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,119
um is going to be a slower evolution

1496
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,760
than the evolution of sort of individual

1497
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,160
particles that might be described by the

1498
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,520
stochastic differential equation or

1499
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,760
longevity equation of that system there

1500
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,160
may be very fast fluctuations but really

1501
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,440
what we're dealing with when we're

1502
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,880
dealing with a focal plank equation is

1503
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,920
some summary statistics and slower

1504
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,599
change over time that might be

1505
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,280
reflective of a mean or a variance

1506
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,880
that does

1507
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,440
link back then into the idea of a

1508
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,079
renormalization group

1509
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,119
which is a way of describing how things

1510
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,680
at one temple scale can be summarized in

1511
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,200
terms of um some slower changes and some

1512
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
faster changes

1513
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,960
typically the way you might do that in a

1514
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,720
dynamical system setting would be to

1515
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,960
look at the the jacobian which is a

1516
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,359
linearized version of the um of the flow

1517
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,559
equation

1518
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,480
um and look at the

1519
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,720
eigenvalues and eigenvectors flow and

1520
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,079
the eigenvalues tell you how quickly

1521
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,079
the system is either expanding or

1522
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,400
contracting or how quickly it's um

1523
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,400
decaying in one direction or in

1524
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,000
unstable systems going off towards

1525
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,359
infinity

1526
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,520
and that means that if you take the set

1527
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,839
of eigen

1528
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,319
they will tell you a series of different

1529
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,079
directions that the system is changing

1530
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,160
in and the speed with which they're

1531
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,160
changing

1532
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,400
that means that you can you can choose

1533
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,960
at some point at which or some threshold

1534
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,839
above which the um eigenvalues are

1535
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,079
considered slow and below which they're

1536
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,160
considered fast and i got that the right

1537
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,760
way around i have as long as they're

1538
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,839
negative eigenvalues

1539
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,440
those eigenvalues are each associated

1540
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
with an eigenvector which is

1541
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,760
just a way of expressing some linear

1542
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,680
combination of the components of that

1543
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,040
system or

1544
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,720
um you could think of it as a direction

1545
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,400
in some high dimensional space that

1546
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,720
describes the the

1547
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,000
position of that system at any one time

1548
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,160
by separating things out or separating

1549
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,400
out the eigenvectors and the particular

1550
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,079
directions based upon whether their

1551
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,119
eigenvalues are large or small

1552
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,640
you can separate the system out into its

1553
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,240
components that move very slowly and

1554
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,400
decay very rapidly oh sorry they move

1555
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,319
very slowly and those that decay very

1556
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,760
rapidly

1557
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,520
um

1558
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,599
and and that's effectively the principle

1559
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,240
that the renormalization group works on

1560
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,079
when applied to these kinds of systems

1561
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,559
because it then says that if if we have

1562
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,079
some way of describing all the things in

1563
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,200
that system

1564
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,799
we separate them out into the fast and

1565
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,480
slow components we can then say well

1566
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,240
let's just look at the fast components

1567
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,400
find some new way of grouping them

1568
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,720
um and then look at the fast components

1569
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,400
of that or the slow components of that

1570
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,839
and continue separating it out

1571
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,680
hierarchically

1572
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,559
to

1573
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,480
multiple different scales

1574
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,760
and that can be quite interesting in a

1575
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,119
range of settings to think about the

1576
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,119
emergent behavior you might get at

1577
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,480
higher and higher levels when the

1578
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,319
dynamics the lower level might be might

1579
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,040
be a very simple description

1580
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,340
um

1581
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,440
[Music]

1582
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,799
and i think that's probably what you

1583
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:07,839
were getting at when you're talking

1584
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,559
about the um the sort of very fast

1585
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,040
movement of atoms in your cells versus

1586
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,040
the slightly slower movement of of

1587
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,400
yourself

1588
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,040
and the even slower movement of things

1589
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,040
that are much larger and and evolve over

1590
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,200
a much larger time scale

1591
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,559
you could read each move from one time

1592
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,319
scale to the slower time scale as an

1593
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,359
application of a renormalization group

1594
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,920
operator

1595
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,079
is that enough

1596
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,520
from your perspective carl have i said

1597
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,119
the words renormalization group enough

1598
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,880
interesting i just wrote down thomas

1599
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,559
when you said thinking about fast and

1600
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,520
slow

1601
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,000
and that plays into this

1602
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,960
meta-bayesian cognitive systems on

1603
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,440
cognitive systems angle

1604
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,359
any entity might be thinking fast and

1605
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,640
slow

1606
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,440
famous work but this is thinking about

1607
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,960
the fast and the slow maybe of a

1608
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,359
cognitive entity and maybe that's

1609
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,799
multi-scale

1610
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,880
so i'm going to bring another

1611
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,440
question into chat and then we'll be

1612
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,160
continuing on

1613
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,680
what type of boundary does

1614
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,799
a markov blanket define for a system

1615
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,440
functional in terms of ports

1616
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,079
or constructive and modular with

1617
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,440
interfaces

1618
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,520
or might both viewpoints be considered

1619
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,040
depending on modeling reasons

1620
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,319
i think for me you may have to unpack

1621
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,920
what some of those terms mean a little

1622
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,920
bit more um

1623
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,359
when you're talking about ports and

1624
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,880
and whether they're constructive what

1625
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,510
does that mean

1626
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,920
[Music]

1627
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,599
it was a question from a chat so i'll

1628
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,920
try to unpack and see what you think

1629
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,160
um

1630
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,200
perhaps even a general question would be

1631
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,440
what is the physical interpretation of

1632
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,839
these markov blankets that are being

1633
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,520
identified

1634
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,680
are they

1635
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,920
causal or functional connections that

1636
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,480
occur across an interface

1637
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,440
like a usb port

1638
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,200
or are they

1639
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,640
the interfaces themselves

1640
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,839
or in what viewpoints exist to interpret

1641
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,480
the markov blanket in terms of the

1642
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,960
modeling of some defined system of

1643
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,440
interest

1644
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,760
it's an interesting question at

1645
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,440
quite a few levels and i think you could

1646
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,319
probably

1647
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,760
you could probably unpack each of those

1648
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,760
terms in several different ways

1649
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,240
um and

1650
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,160
i i guess the first thing to do is think

1651
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,760
about how we define a markov blanket and

1652
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,480
what it what it actually means because

1653
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,400
we can we can sit around interpreting it

1654
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,839
in various ways of different sorts of

1655
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:06,960
systems

1656
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,039
but actually the key the key thing is

1657
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,119
that it's a probabilistic relationship

1658
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,000
it's a relationship between

1659
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,520
normally three distinct sets of

1660
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,480
variables

1661
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,520
um

1662
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
where we're saying that

1663
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,119
two of those types of variable are

1664
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,960
separated by the markov blanket

1665
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,039
probabilistically and all that means is

1666
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:25,839
that

1667
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,520
the two that are being separated are

1668
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,119
conditionally independent of one another

1669
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,039
once we know the thing that's doing the

1670
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,720
separating and the thing that's doing

1671
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,720
the separating is the markov blanket

1672
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,440
and often that means that there are

1673
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,200
direct relationships between each of

1674
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,880
those things in the blanket but no

1675
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,920
direct relationship across the blanket

1676
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,119
but then it's important to think about

1677
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,960
what sort of relationships we're talking

1678
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
about whether those are dynamical

1679
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,720
relationships and

1680
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,400
causal relationships and all sorts of

1681
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,319
other other ways you can describe the

1682
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,039
interactions between pairs of

1683
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,400
states

1684
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
and

1685
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,160
and it's a discussion we've had on and

1686
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,039
off for

1687
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,640
the last couple of years really about

1688
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,160
what is the relationship between

1689
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,880
dynamics and

1690
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,640
probabilistic relationships and even

1691
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,240
which probability distributions are

1692
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,640
appropriate to to use to even define a

1693
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,760
markov blanket of this sort

1694
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,799
um

1695
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,559
one answer to that is that we can look

1696
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,960
at the markov blankets associated with

1697
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,559
some steady state density um

1698
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,079
but we can also do the same thing with

1699
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,520
any probability distribution which

1700
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,760
includes distributions over

1701
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,880
um

1702
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,720
over the paths and look at the

1703
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,559
independence or dependence between

1704
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,520
different paths when formulated in terms

1705
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,119
of path there's a slightly clearer

1706
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,720
relationship between the dynamics of the

1707
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,599
system and the markov blanket because

1708
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,200
once we've said that the path of one

1709
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,119
variable

1710
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,799
or two sets of variables are independent

1711
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,520
one another given the

1712
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,599
[Music]

1713
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,280
the truth about the dynamical coupling

1714
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,039
and implies a certain degree of sparse

1715
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,079
coupling

1716
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,720
um between those in a in a dynamical

1717
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,839
setting

1718
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,000
and so that and it's probably once you

1719
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,359
look at the dynamical setting there's a

1720
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,480
lot of the

1721
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,440
physics

1722
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,680
as you've framed it might come in

1723
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,280
because you can then start to interpret

1724
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,720
that in terms of

1725
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,240
physical influences and things that

1726
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,559
might cause an acceleration or a

1727
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,119
change in velocity or change in position

1728
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,559
and interpreted in terms of physical

1729
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,079
forces

1730
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,319
um

1731
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,799
there are um

1732
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,799
there are of course other other ways in

1733
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,240
which you can look at markup blankets

1734
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,760
and sometimes they're interpreted in

1735
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,760
terms of sort of cell membranes and that

1736
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,880
sort of thing and i wondered whether

1737
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,640
that was what was meant when ports were

1738
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,960
mentioned because you can think of sort

1739
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,880
of iron channels as being ports that

1740
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,400
allow interactions

1741
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,280
uh between two sets of states i think

1742
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,960
when people make those sorts of

1743
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,039
comparisons you have to be very careful

1744
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,480
about what exactly you mean which

1745
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,960
variables reflect um different parts of

1746
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,760
that blanket so for instance you might

1747
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,079
talk about intracellular extracellular

1748
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,079
ion concentrations

1749
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,640
and being independent of one another

1750
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,960
conditioned upon the state of some

1751
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,200
cellular protein

1752
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,520
and

1753
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,319
so i i think again it's an interesting

1754
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,520
question and there are lots of different

1755
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,200
ways you could unpack it and you could

1756
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,880
think about a range of different systems

1757
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,400
and try and interpret what the markov

1758
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,599
blanket is there and what the physical

1759
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,359
interpretation of that is if it is a

1760
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,078
physical system

1761
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,160
ultimately i think probably the physics

1762
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,200
of it is

1763
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,960
going to be articulated most clearly in

1764
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,119
terms of dynamical equations

1765
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,200
um which sometimes bear a direct

1766
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,799
relationship to the mark of blanket but

1767
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,720
it depends where it's defined or in what

1768
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,200
domain it's defined

1769
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,038
awesome

1770
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,680
there was two complementary ways

1771
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,480
that

1772
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,359
this

1773
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,799
question one

1774
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,640
it's like this is where the two paths

1775
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,599
first branched and they're complementary

1776
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,440
but

1777
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,720
could you

1778
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,079
describe

1779
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,559
where equation one begins

1780
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,760
and read it however you see fit and then

1781
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,079
the question mark at the end

1782
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,119
and then

1783
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,520
help us understand how

1784
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,920
the probability density can be expressed

1785
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,960
in two complementary ways

1786
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,280
what is equation one showing what does

1787
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,760
the question mark leave us with and how

1788
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,839
do these two sides shown on the left and

1789
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,599
the right provide two complementary

1790
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,599
approaches

1791
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,839
i feel like i've done a lot of talking

1792
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,280
but i'm happy to take this one as well

1793
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,400
if you if you'd like me to

1794
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,839
i'm sure

1795
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,280
so the

1796
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,599
first line of equation one um we're

1797
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,839
really just describing some dynamical

1798
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,359
system that

1799
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,760
has some fluctuations associated with it

1800
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,359
so there's some degree

1801
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:04,160
of

1802
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,559
randomness um where that randomness may

1803
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,799
be interpretable as deterministic

1804
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,559
behavior at a much faster scale that

1805
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,480
we're effectively ignoring through the

1806
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,640
application of our renormalization group

1807
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,960
we were speaking about earlier

1808
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,560
and so our x in this equation is this

1809
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,238
some variable that's evolving through

1810
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,600
time

1811
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,158
um the f of x describes

1812
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,040
how uh in a deterministic system that

1813
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,479
the rate of change of number that

1814
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,319
variable um

1815
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,759
would depend upon the variable itself

1816
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,319
depend upon its position in space

1817
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,600
and the omega term at the end here it

1818
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,279
tells us that there's some additional

1819
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,960
fluctuations associated with that

1820
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,120
something that's um changing in a less

1821
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,359
predictable way at least at the scale

1822
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,719
and speed of description that we're

1823
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,359
interested in

1824
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,359
the second line of the equation um

1825
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,399
provides

1826
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,960
a little more definition to that so

1827
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,759
the first equality is relating

1828
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,359
the

1829
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,719
current position of the system the

1830
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,520
current x to the

1831
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,399
um

1832
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,600
the

1833
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,279
probability density describing the

1834
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,439
fluctuations so saying how that's likely

1835
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,319
to be

1836
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,920
at any one point

1837
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,960
and here we're saying that it's

1838
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,479
something that is

1839
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,359
zero mean so we if we were to take an

1840
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,040
average over time the fluctuation would

1841
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,359
end up averaging to zero

1842
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,799
um

1843
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,120
but then we're also defining a variance

1844
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,520
that's the same this is this two times

1845
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,080
gamma uh parameter which effectively

1846
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,399
tells us about the um

1847
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,198
the

1848
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,640
amplitude of those fluctuations

1849
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,479
the implication symbol then is saying

1850
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,600
okay so if we've um

1851
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,679
if we've found that

1852
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,279
or if we've defined it in this way so we

1853
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,279
now know the form of fluctuations that

1854
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,520
then tells us the form of the rate of

1855
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
change of x

1856
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,640
um and we know that if the average rate

1857
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,920
of change of

1858
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,600
um or the average fluctuation is going

1859
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,120
to be zero then the average rate of

1860
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
change of x is just going to be our f of

1861
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,679
x so the same

1862
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,440
path or the same rate of change the x

1863
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,560
would have if we were dealing with a

1864
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,239
deterministic system

1865
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,000
however we then have this additional

1866
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,520
uncertainty around that rate of change

1867
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,320
um

1868
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,480
which inherits exactly the same variance

1869
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,679
as the

1870
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,719
random punctuation state

1871
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,239
so

1872
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,239
we then finally have this this third

1873
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,640
line which says so what is

1874
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,560
this probability distribution how do we

1875
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,080
now account for

1876
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,640
um what the distribution of x would be

1877
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,320
at some time or um

1878
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,719
and i say at some time to make an

1879
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:43,890
additional distinction that isn't

1880
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,199
[Music]

1881
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,679
necessarily expressed in this slide

1882
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,400
which is that

1883
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,000
we can talk about the distribution of x

1884
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,760
evolving through time from some initial

1885
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
conditions or we can talk about the

1886
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,440
distribution that it will eventually

1887
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,080
attain if we if we wait until we're a

1888
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,560
long way from our initial conditions

1889
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,800
which is then the steady state density

1890
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,120
so the point at which the blank equation

1891
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,220
here evaluates to zero um

1892
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,520
[Music]

1893
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,840
so there are several ways now we can we

1894
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,320
can think about the distribution of x

1895
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,920
and the density associated with it

1896
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,600
equation three then says well we could

1897
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,800
also look at it a different way and

1898
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,480
think about some

1899
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,960
distribution or density over alternative

1900
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,719
trajectories that x could take in

1901
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,400
alternative paths

1902
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
which is a description of a slightly

1903
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,960
different sort of quantity but is um is

1904
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,880
equivalent in many ways because they're

1905
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,800
determined by exactly the same things

1906
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,560
does that sort of make sense i know said

1907
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,280
quite a lot there

1908
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,239
awesome

1909
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,960
have i got myself out of answering the

1910
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,199
next question

1911
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,880
yes

1912
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,120
probably one rain pass

1913
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
um

1914
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,360
maybe we can even just continue walking

1915
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,520
through and understanding the formalisms

1916
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,320
it's how we structure the dot zeros is

1917
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,400
with the formalisms and the figures in

1918
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,440
order

1919
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,960
and so we we

1920
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,800
follow along and try to connect key

1921
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,880
points in between

1922
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,600
so

1923
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,480
um you wrote that both the focker planck

1924
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,159
and the path integral formulations

1925
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,920
inherit their functional form from

1926
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,440
assumptions about the statistics of

1927
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,080
random fluctuations in one which we just

1928
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,520
described

1929
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,320
then

1930
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,199
you describe the path of least action

1931
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,719
and the most

1932
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,239
likely path

1933
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:39,040
so

1934
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,199
what is happening in four

1935
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,080
where is the fluctuation being reduced

1936
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,199
to zero

1937
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,120
and what does it mean to take the most

1938
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,840
likely path or the path of least action

1939
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,400
blue do you want to do this what do you

1940
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,800
want me to do

1941
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,560
definitely by all means carl why don't

1942
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
you why don't you go

1943
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,840
okay um so just to backtrack a little

1944
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,280
bit and just to reiterate some of the

1945
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,719
key points that thomas just made um just

1946
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,280
notice that the everything basically

1947
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,840
starts with this largemouth equation or

1948
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,480
stochastic differential equation

1949
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,320
and then you can go in one of two ways

1950
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,199
you can go via the density dynamics

1951
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,040
description of the

1952
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,120
of the probability density distribution

1953
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,880
which is a description which is

1954
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,800
deterministic or you can go by the path

1955
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,640
integral formulation and you can map

1956
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,800
gracefully between one the other they're

1957
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,640
complementary you can derive one from

1958
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,239
the other a little bit like the

1959
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,880
difference between dealing with the

1960
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,560
equations of motion or dealing with the

1961
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,920
convolution operators that we're just

1962
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,920
talking about they're equivalent in many

1963
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,199
senses

1964
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,280
however the way that they are used in

1965
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,440
the free energy principle are very

1966
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,040
distinct so i just wanted to rehearse

1967
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,199
that because that speaks to the the

1968
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,440
particular question here um you know

1969
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,679
what where where where did the random

1970
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,199
fluctuations go

1971
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,000
um

1972
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,920
before i do that though just to note

1973
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,800
that

1974
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,280
all the the first

1975
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,679
equality in equation one

1976
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,199
is telling you

1977
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,040
is that there is some probabilistic

1978
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,719
relationship between x and x dot

1979
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,880
that's all it's saying it says saying

1980
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,560
that there is some coupling and normally

1981
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,440
in terms of a causal coupling between a

1982
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,800
function of x

1983
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,440
and x dot so if you just think about our

1984
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,800
previous conversation in terms of

1985
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
generalized coordinates of motion and

1986
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
everything coming along in pairs like

1987
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,560
p's and q's in classical physics or

1988
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,120
real and imaginaries in um in quantum

1989
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,080
physics and this is why there's always a

1990
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,159
pair of things

1991
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,400
at least two things to worry about

1992
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,800
because all that we're saying here is

1993
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,159
that there's some relationship between

1994
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,480
where you are and how you're moving

1995
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,560
in state space and it's a probabilistic

1996
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,000
relationship and so if you um if you

1997
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,920
think about what that means in terms of

1998
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,080
modeling things this is a state space

1999
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,320
model so it tells you nothing about

2000
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,960
which is the most likely state to be in

2001
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,600
it just tells you how likely where am i

2002
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,199
going to go from here

2003
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,800
that's all it's all it's telling that's

2004
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
all we know

2005
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,239
so you can start to think now about um

2006
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,400
the probability distributions are where

2007
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,320
i will be in the future

2008
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,640
um or you can think about probability

2009
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,480
distributions um

2010
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,239
over the trajectories or the paths that

2011
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:33,520
you take and that's basically what

2012
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,679
thomas was you know was highlighting

2013
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,880
previously

2014
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,840
um

2015
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,480
in the free energy principle

2016
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,719
the fokker plank is actually not used

2017
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:45,920
very much

2018
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,920
so i'm just saying

2019
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,440
for blue's benefit you know she was

2020
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,360
worried about the so fast and slow and

2021
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,600
how does that fit into the focal plank

2022
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,800
in fact

2023
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,480
most of the interesting stuff comes from

2024
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,719
the path integral formulation the the

2025
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,040
vodka plank is you know does bring a lot

2026
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,400
to the table

2027
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,800
but only when you look at the solutions

2028
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,480
to the focal plank equation that you

2029
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,520
would get um under the assumption that

2030
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,360
it has a solution and you get into

2031
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,040
things like the helmholtz decomposition

2032
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,040
and solenoidal flow and all that

2033
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,640
interesting stuff and the link between

2034
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,760
the steady state density over states and

2035
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,400
the

2036
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,560
um the dynamical coupling that

2037
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,239
underwrites or defines the um the the

2038
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,159
original orange van equation but

2039
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,080
if you you can ignore all that if you

2040
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,400
wanted to and just talk about

2041
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,560
the probability distributions over paths

2042
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,440
so no longer am i defining me

2043
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,640
my homeostasis in terms of the states

2044
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,000
that i occupy that's the side product

2045
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,239
of the trajectories and the dynamics

2046
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,000
that i typically convince when i'm in

2047
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,239
this situation or at this point in state

2048
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,360
space so i think the more powerful and

2049
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,360
certainly the the basis of the free

2050
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,040
energy um

2051
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,520
principle the more powerful calculus is

2052
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,520
actually in the pathetical formulation

2053
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,120
so you can tell a free energy principle

2054
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,040
story without even mentioning the vocal

2055
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,920
plank

2056
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,600
equation if you wanted to and really

2057
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,280
that story is a story of um least action

2058
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,040
or hamilton's principle of least action

2059
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,560
so what does that mean it just means

2060
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,360
that

2061
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,760
one way of summarizing the behavior of

2062
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,080
things or the characteristic behavior of

2063
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,040
things

2064
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,280
is in terms of the most likely way

2065
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,880
forward from here the most likely

2066
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,840
trajectory or path from this point

2067
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,239
in state space

2068
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,159
what is that it is the path of least

2069
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,400
action what is that is nothing more than

2070
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
the most likely path

2071
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,320
what is the most likely path well it's

2072
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,040
just given by the longevity equation the

2073
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,520
flow operator the f of x

2074
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,040
iterated in time in the absence or under

2075
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,080
the most likely random fluctuations

2076
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,600
so one of the most likely random

2077
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,600
fluctuations well we just said that the

2078
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,440
most the most likely random fluctuation

2079
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,640
is zero

2080
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,120
so all that we're doing is taking the

2081
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,600
omega the random fluctuations

2082
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,800
out of the equations of motion and that

2083
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,640
just is the path of least action where

2084
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,440
which is just the most likely path

2085
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,520
um and if you apply the calculus of

2086
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,040
variations

2087
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,760
to

2088
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,080
that notion you get these expressions

2089
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,920
that in equation for here so the

2090
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,440
if you interpret the action a

2091
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,040
as the probability or the surprisal

2092
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,360
or the negative log probability of a

2093
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,800
particular path

2094
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,440
then if you want to minimize the action

2095
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,480
you're just

2096
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,520
trying to identify the path that that is

2097
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,880
most likely that is just the evolution

2098
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,320
of the system without any random

2099
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,840
fluctuations so the first

2100
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,719
expression um

2101
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,960
which follows a convention pursued in

2102
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,480
this paper and other papers uh that

2103
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,600
the paths of least action are namely the

2104
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,239
most likely paths are in bold phase all

2105
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,159
this says is the most likely path in

2106
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,600
bulk phase

2107
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,679
simply is that which renders that path

2108
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,400
the most likely for this system which is

2109
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,800
another way of saying that it minimizes

2110
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,960
the action

2111
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,199
what does that mean well it means if you

2112
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,159
deviate from this path in any way

2113
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,400
known as a variation and you know

2114
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,159
variational calculus

2115
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:31,840
if you vary or deviate from this path

2116
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,239
then you are going to

2117
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,320
increase the action so you can think of

2118
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,159
a marble rolling down a long valley

2119
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:40,960
and

2120
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,199
the course of the marble

2121
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,199
rolling down a long valley

2122
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,679
will or will follow a trajectory that is

2123
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,640
always at the minimum of the the height

2124
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,640
of the valley

2125
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,360
and therefore any deviation from that

2126
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,400
path

2127
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,960
will cause you to climb the sides of the

2128
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,400
valley and therefore the path integral

2129
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,159
or the average action perfect and the

2130
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,760
average action

2131
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
will be slightly bigger than the path of

2132
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,120
least action

2133
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,080
so that's basically what is meant by the

2134
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,960
second implication which is that any

2135
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,280
variation of the path about the path of

2136
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,639
least action

2137
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:26,080
will cause an increase in the uh action

2138
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,239
um and another way of stating that is

2139
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,560
that the path of least action at the

2140
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,120
point of the minima infinitesimal

2141
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,199
changes don't change the action because

2142
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,760
you're at the flat bottom or

2143
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,880
um

2144
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,840
microscopically the valley has has

2145
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,800
bottomed out and therefore um your

2146
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,360
variation is zero

2147
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,880
and

2148
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,199
another way of expressing that is where

2149
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,360
we started which is the path of least

2150
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,480
action

2151
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,639
follows a trajectory in the absence of

2152
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,639
any random fluctuations which is just

2153
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,199
the final equality down there so it's

2154
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,120
just the original launch val equation

2155
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,679
but without random fluctuations or with

2156
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,120
the most likely

2157
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,239
random fluctuations

2158
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,840
so i brought on

2159
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,920
as you saw this uh classical waddington

2160
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,760
epigenetic landscape

2161
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,800
here's the marble

2162
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,320
rolling down a hill coming towards us

2163
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,520
might we interpret decisions

2164
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,639
as being bifurcations or

2165
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,639
if we're talking about paths of least

2166
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,800
action in space

2167
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,040
or paths of least action on cognitive

2168
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,639
parameters

2169
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:39,920
where do

2170
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,840
decisions come into play

2171
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,159
that's definitely for blue that one

2172
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,040
yep i knew it

2173
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,679
so

2174
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,920
can can we even make decisions i'm going

2175
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,679
to just answer your question with a

2176
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:02,639
question

2177
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,920
uh um

2178
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,880
because

2179
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,520
i mean if if up until this point we are

2180
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,600
just a sum of all the things that have

2181
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,480
occurred

2182
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,880
up up into this point you know we now

2183
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,080
have a model

2184
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,960
that that's based on all previous action

2185
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,800
and when you come to this you know

2186
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,400
bifurcating path

2187
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,000
um you're just going to take the one

2188
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,080
that that minimizes free energy right

2189
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,880
like like isn't that how it goes

2190
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,000
so according to your model and all the

2191
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
things that have brought an organism to

2192
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,480
that point

2193
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,159
that's my answer

2194
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,800
to it right i want thomas to answer now

2195
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,280
but he can't he must use the words free

2196
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,520
will

2197
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,120
i'm not going there

2198
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
i don't think philosophically qualified

2199
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,280
enough to use those words i skipped

2200
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
right over it but but but said it more

2201
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,840
or less

2202
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,280
anyone can address how is free will

2203
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,360
related to free energy

2204
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:03,040
or how decision making plays into a

2205
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,000
path of least action

2206
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,960
while thomas is gathering his thoughts

2207
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,360
to slip free will in a non-philosophical

2208
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,120
sense into his response i think that's

2209
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,360
absolutely right so um

2210
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,920
you know the notion of a bifurcation i

2211
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,679
think is very prescient when you think

2212
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,639
about uh paths of least action on any

2213
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,400
energy landscape in particular free

2214
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,719
energy landscape um

2215
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:27,520
and

2216
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,120
um

2217
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,760
but at the same time we if we just

2218
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,760
pursue the path of least action there

2219
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,840
are no decisions or it looks as if there

2220
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,280
are no decisions from a mathematical

2221
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,239
point of view but in virtue of the fact

2222
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,760
that

2223
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,400
there is an indeterminacy about the

2224
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,560
paths you would pursue

2225
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,960
from the initial where you start say the

2226
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,040
marble at the beginning of the top of

2227
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,480
the hill here

2228
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,480
that indeterminacy i think does call

2229
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,120
into question uh whether um the uh

2230
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,400
technically the

2231
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,719
chaotic structure that underwrites the

2232
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,880
itinerancy of the thing that we are

2233
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,239
trying to model

2234
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,120
will actually induce a sensitivity to

2235
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,800
initial conditions which means that we

2236
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,920
can never totally predict how we will

2237
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,639
behave or the decisions we will make

2238
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,880
given our state of mind and the state of

2239
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,639
the world at the present time so i think

2240
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,199
there is a latitude to talk about free

2241
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,080
will

2242
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,040
but

2243
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,880
it would be uh of the kind that inherits

2244
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,719
from

2245
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,440
deterministic chaos and sensitivity to

2246
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,360
initial conditions

2247
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,199
and that's

2248
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,440
that's quite important of framing it in

2249
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,600
the context of bifurcations in

2250
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,960
deterministic dynamical systems theory

2251
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,800
it's quite an important move because of

2252
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,199
course the longevity equation

2253
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,679
does not admit deterministic chaos

2254
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,000
because you've got random fluctuations

2255
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,080
so you have stochastic chaos or you

2256
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,000
could have stochastic chaos but you

2257
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,320
can't have deterministic chaos

2258
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,040
so the question now is um where does

2259
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,239
deter

2260
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,639
is there any opportunity for

2261
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,719
deterministic chaos

2262
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,760
um in the context of

2263
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,199
the free energy

2264
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,520
description of

2265
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,840
sentient behavior and choice making and

2266
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,120
i think there is

2267
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,800
but only in a very special class of

2268
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,520
systems where the internal the

2269
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,199
particular states or the internal states

2270
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,679
in the blanket states and don't have any

2271
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,679
random fluctuations and you may be

2272
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,360
asking well there must also have random

2273
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,840
fluctuations well not necessarily at a

2274
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,360
particular scale

2275
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,719
if you take um a hundred million neurons

2276
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,880
or say even a million neurons

2277
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,400
and you now write down your state as the

2278
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,880
average of a population or ensemble of

2279
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,080
neurons

2280
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,840
all the random fluctuations and neural

2281
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,440
noise will be averaged away and this is

2282
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,960
exactly the same

2283
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,639
mechanics that thomas was talking about

2284
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,440
before in terms of

2285
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,719
the renormalization group and taking

2286
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,320
certain mixtures

2287
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,480
carefully to

2288
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,040
eliminate fast fluctuations and random

2289
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,360
fluctuations so the argument would be um

2290
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,560
here if you want to talk about

2291
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,639
bifurcations in the sense of

2292
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,320
transcritical bifurcations or hot

2293
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,840
bifurcations

2294
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,239
as a way of describing a particular path

2295
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,320
of least action

2296
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,360
or

2297
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,120
paths of least action from slightly

2298
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,560
different um

2299
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,639
initial conditions

2300
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,480
then i think you'd have to you'd be

2301
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,400
perfectly licensed to do that but you'd

2302
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,600
have to

2303
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,520
be very careful in saying that we are

2304
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,280
assuming here

2305
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,000
that the dynamics are deterministic and

2306
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
therefore only apply at a particular

2307
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,440
scale and they apply it at a scale where

2308
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,520
the particular dynamics the internal and

2309
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,719
blanket states don't possess any random

2310
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,280
fluctuations of that matter

2311
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,440
and that's quite interesting because um

2312
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,199
there are other things that inherit from

2313
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,440
that that assumption you know again

2314
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,199
coming back to this notion of you know

2315
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,520
different kinds of particles some very

2316
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,679
very small particles like the single

2317
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,760
cells that blue was talking about before

2318
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,760
maybe so small as in number and in size

2319
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,000
that you cannot average away

2320
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
the random fluctuations and they would

2321
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,480
not show any deterministic chaos

2322
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,920
but there may be a a of course a grain

2323
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,560
description of neuronal dynamics and

2324
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,800
computational anatomy

2325
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,120
that does actually acquire a

2326
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,760
deterministic aspect a classical aspect

2327
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,000
where you have an end body like problem

2328
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,760
which will invariably show some kind of

2329
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,840
deterministic chaos which means that

2330
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,320
then you can get back to

2331
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,199
one

2332
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:45,040
form of um looking at or something that

2333
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,840
might look like free will anyway now

2334
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,600
thomas has had plenty of time to tell us

2335
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,760
about the dynamics of free will

2336
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,680
so i i noticed that um

2337
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,840
[Music]

2338
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,040
the way you framed that was in terms of

2339
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,520
unpredictability and that

2340
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,360
under the definition of free will you

2341
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,880
were using there

2342
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,360
uh it's things where

2343
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,520
we wouldn't necessarily be able to

2344
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,520
predict in advance how well a particular

2345
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,480
or how a particular system would evolve

2346
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,159
and i'm sure that will

2347
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,719
please some philosophers and upset

2348
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:21,840
many others

2349
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,120
um

2350
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,960
i don't have an alternative definition

2351
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,159
that would

2352
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,350
work better please everybody

2353
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:30,239
[Music]

2354
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:30,500
and

2355
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,840
[Music]

2356
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,320
so i i suppose we've spoken really about

2357
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,800
one side of things which is the the

2358
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
deterministic aspect

2359
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,480
and clearly that does become very

2360
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,400
relevant at

2361
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,880
larger and slower scales

2362
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,400
and i suppose it's also interesting to

2363
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,120
think about unpredictability when

2364
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,679
stochastic

2365
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,760
dynamics become much more important

2366
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,120
so we certainly could think about

2367
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,800
systems where there are multiple

2368
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,840
plausible paths and where

2369
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,600
and

2370
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,840
whether or even a continuum of plausible

2371
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,120
paths and

2372
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,960
the particular path they end up taking

2373
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,639
will depend upon

2374
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,880
uh the the um

2375
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,560
particular values that the fluctuations

2376
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,440
take

2377
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,080
during the course of that path

2378
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,480
arguably if the fluctuations are

2379
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,040
themselves just dynamical systems that

2380
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,639
are deterministic but

2381
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,239
occurring at a much faster scale it's

2382
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,719
still not really an unpredictability of

2383
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,960
a stochastic sort because ultimately

2384
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,480
it's described by a deterministic

2385
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,000
dynamical system

2386
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,920
um which again brings us back to this

2387
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,639
renormalization group idea

2388
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,960
and it depends a little bit on your your

2389
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,040
interpretation of what happens at the

2390
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,120
slowest or so the fastest possible

2391
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,239
scales

2392
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,239
um when we

2393
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:49,199
perform this renormalization operation

2394
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,199
is the fastest scale something that is

2395
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:53,520
genuinely random or is it something that

2396
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,400
is

2397
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,159
a sort of recursive

2398
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,840
um

2399
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,080
recursively faster deterministic

2400
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,320
dynamics

2401
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,880
and either way it may be that if

2402
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,639
stochastic descriptions are most

2403
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,960
appropriate at some scale of description

2404
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,159
um

2405
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,760
we can develop a form of

2406
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,639
unpredictability both from things like

2407
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,880
deterministic chaos and uncertainty over

2408
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,320
initial conditions

2409
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,840
but also potentially from the form of

2410
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,600
the random fluctuations that happen

2411
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,679
along the particular trajectory in

2412
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,120
systems that have more randomness

2413
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,960
involved

2414
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,120
um clearly when we're doing

2415
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,239
um

2416
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,159
when we're trying to describe a real

2417
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,239
system or a real brain and the decisions

2418
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,000
people make

2419
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,400
we clearly don't have access to every

2420
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,800
part of our system um and

2421
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,560
what every neuron in that brain is doing

2422
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,320
so to some extent we're always dealing

2423
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,440
with a partially stochastic system

2424
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,679
and that feeds into how we might end up

2425
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,280
modeling behavior in those kinds of

2426
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,880
systems as well

2427
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,639
so if we were trying to fit an active

2428
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,320
inference style model to real behavior

2429
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,719
or even simulated vapor often what we

2430
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,800
end up doing is adding in a term to

2431
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,080
account for some

2432
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,080
uncertainty in the action selection or

2433
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,840
uncertainty that we as experimenters

2434
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,199
have

2435
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,159
in the action someone might choose even

2436
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,080
if we think we know what the expected

2437
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,280
free energy they're going to calculate

2438
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,639
is and how they're going to evaluate the

2439
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,199
alternative paths they might choose

2440
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,400
and

2441
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,199
so that's just an acknowledgement that

2442
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,800
if we don't know everything we don't

2443
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,840
have a complete description of the

2444
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,520
system then we have to

2445
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,520
to some extent to allow for some

2446
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,800
stochastic

2447
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,440
parts of that of course that that

2448
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,840
stochastic element may be purely the

2449
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,679
uncertainty over the initial conditions

2450
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,760
in a system that can exhibit chaotic

2451
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,760
behavior and that bifurcates in various

2452
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,400
different ways

2453
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,880
awesome

2454
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,920
we'll

2455
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,560
continue on as we approach the end of

2456
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,320
the dot one

2457
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,639
and introduce something we had talked

2458
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,120
about in terms of the markov blanket

2459
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,239
previously but it's the particular

2460
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,600
partition

2461
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,440
so

2462
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,040
how have other mechanics

2463
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,120
addressed particles

2464
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,880
and how does this

2465
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,320
particle

2466
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,600
framework

2467
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,120
do something different and what does

2468
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,559
that different framing enable

2469
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,560
it's blue's turn or i could give a shot

2470
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,159
why don't you go ahead daniel

2471
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:30,960
okay

2472
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,760
as a non-physicist my understanding is

2473
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,520
that particles

2474
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,000
have not been explicitly modeled this

2475
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,960
way

2476
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,639
and fields

2477
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,239
or continua

2478
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:43,440
have been

2479
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,000
the norm

2480
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,440
the particulate

2481
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,320
description provided here

2482
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,800
enables a principled approach to

2483
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,920
separating figure from ground

2484
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,159
from separating an entity that's being

2485
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,719
tracked that's doing the movement

2486
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,000
away from the entity that is not doing

2487
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,120
the movement

2488
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,360
in a sense

2489
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,960
that would just be one

2490
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,199
thought

2491
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,760
which i would concur with very much you

2492
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,360
know it's um

2493
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,040
if you if you go back and think about

2494
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,280
the physics you did at school

2495
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,159
um

2496
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,719
usually it will be focused on

2497
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,159
the behavior of some idealized gas in

2498
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:32,159
what they would call a heat bath or a

2499
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,679
heat reservoir

2500
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,199
and

2501
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,880
really what the particular petition

2502
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,239
brings to the table

2503
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,880
are deep questions about how did that

2504
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,800
heat path get there and the heat path

2505
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,120
now stands in for blanket states and

2506
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,120
what's beyond the heat path

2507
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,400
the external states so you know

2508
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,280
it is it is a move which i am not aware

2509
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,320
of

2510
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:58,560
being um attempted in any other branch

2511
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,080
of physics so in quantum physics the

2512
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,239
markov blanket or the thing that

2513
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,440
contains the particle of interest

2514
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,440
probabilistically speaking is usually

2515
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,960
defined in terms of a screening of

2516
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,040
potential in the functional form of that

2517
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,280
potential leads to all the applications

2518
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,800
of quantum electrodynamics that you

2519
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,639
might encounter and i repeat um

2520
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:21,840
in

2521
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,880
thermodynamics people just talk about

2522
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,960
you know there being some blanket states

2523
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,679
in terms of a heat path but don't go

2524
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,360
they don't think about what's beyond the

2525
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,280
heat path

2526
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,840
in terms of classical mechanics

2527
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,199
um

2528
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,360
perhaps there is a notion of particles

2529
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,199
there which is less less um

2530
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,239
less

2531
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,880
if you like hidden under under the wrong

2532
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,960
the rug um

2533
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,040
but of course you uh don't have any

2534
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,840
explicit representation of the internal

2535
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,679
dynamics because normally

2536
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,760
classical mechanics is just dealing with

2537
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,360
you know the motion of heavenly bodies

2538
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,520
or large massive objects without really

2539
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,040
thinking about their

2540
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,320
uh the faster dynamics that underwrite

2541
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,639
um autonomous movement or animate

2542
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,920
movement or what um people in chemistry

2543
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,679
might refer to as active matter

2544
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:18,400
just

2545
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,199
a few thoughts on that the classical

2546
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,199
indeed it does deal with diffusing

2547
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,199
particles massive bodies but just like

2548
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,480
you pointed out

2549
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,280
it

2550
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,360
doesn't consider internal states so it's

2551
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,920
like a view from the outside and this is

2552
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,080
a bit more like a view from both sides

2553
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,400
which enables us to have sentient or

2554
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,639
cognitive behavior on both sides of the

2555
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,800
observation interface rather than

2556
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,119
implicitly on only one side which is a

2557
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,800
very different situation

2558
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,679
and then you uh talked about in this

2559
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:48,880
thermo

2560
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,440
physics context and in this quantum

2561
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,199
physics context like

2562
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:56,639
what is beyond the boundary and

2563
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,880
then uh in the quantum case you said

2564
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,480
that that was like the role of the heat

2565
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,560
bath and what's outside of it is the

2566
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,239
schrodinger potential and what's outside

2567
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,320
of it and that makes me think about

2568
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,400
schrodinger's implicit question and

2569
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,480
schrodinger's explicit question

2570
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,920
schrodinger's explicit question in 1944

2571
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,199
and in ramstead at all 2018 was what is

2572
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,960
life

2573
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,600
schrodinger's implicit question was what

2574
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,280
is beyond

2575
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,560
the quantum what is outside of that

2576
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,520
and so

2577
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,679
it's almost um

2578
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,840
interesting though appropriate that the

2579
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,560
particular partition

2580
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,880
actually brings those two together

2581
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,639
but i would let anyone else reflect to

2582
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,280
how they're brought together

2583
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,600
if anyone wants to add or we'll just

2584
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,080
continue to leave a few little pieces

2585
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,440
before closing the dot one

2586
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,600
i was hoping that thomas and blue would

2587
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,080
yeah he has an excellent observation uh

2588
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,679
and i just wanted to reinforce it um so

2589
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,760
in you know what is life

2590
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,000
it's basically um coming back to our

2591
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,119
early question it's um those it's those

2592
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,199
systems that are equipped with a

2593
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,639
homeostasis of sorts but beyond that

2594
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:25,040
these things move so there is there are

2595
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,119
homeostatic systems that are

2596
01:37:28,119 --> 01:37:30,639
self-constructing and self-maintaining

2597
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,199
that move and this i think speaks to the

2598
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,360
importance of having this the active

2599
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,000
states that couple back and influence

2600
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,639
the um the external states beyond the

2601
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,960
markov blankets uh you know again

2602
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,800
speaking to another important natural

2603
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,719
kind the distinction between inert

2604
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:50,719
particles and active particles um where

2605
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,119
you've got this active autopoetic like

2606
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:57,119
aspect to the maintenance of uh of the

2607
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:00,320
homeostasis so you know

2608
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,000
i think that's quite an important

2609
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,800
observation that we're not talking about

2610
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,280
we are talking about a bi-directional

2611
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,639
exchange across the markov blanket um uh

2612
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,719
just to reiterate your sort of

2613
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,400
observation that what we're doing here

2614
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,159
is trying to account for the coupling

2615
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,000
between the inside and the outside of

2616
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,440
something we're not just interested in

2617
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,520
the inside as in classical physics or

2618
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,080
the outside uh or what it looks like

2619
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,480
from the outside in terms of um sorry

2620
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,159
thermo

2621
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,080
statistical mechanics or what it looks

2622
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,000
like from the outside in terms of

2623
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,360
classical mechanics we're actually

2624
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,920
trying to get to the meat of the

2625
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,239
maintenance of a markov blanket and

2626
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:42,159
thickness in an active context

2627
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,440
so then as a closing

2628
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,679
round here i wanna

2629
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,800
point to one tension that we

2630
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,040
pulled in the dot zero

2631
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,880
so here in footnote um 21

2632
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,679
it says a lot of interesting things

2633
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:02,080
but then it says minimization implies

2634
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:05,199
the teleology that goes beyond any claim

2635
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:06,639
of the fep

2636
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:08,719
do particles minimize surprisal or free

2637
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,000
energy well

2638
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,320
minimization implies a teleology that

2639
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,360
goes beyond any claim of the fep

2640
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,080
okay very well

2641
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,840
later

2642
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,480
the question is asked is it tenable to

2643
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,719
interpret gradient flows on variational

2644
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,520
free energy as variational inference or

2645
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,679
is this just teleological window

2646
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:30,880
dressing

2647
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,840
so

2648
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,920
where is teleology

2649
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,639
is

2650
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,880
teleology

2651
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,600
in the fep

2652
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,840
or is it window dressing what's the

2653
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,760
window what's the building what's

2654
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,840
outside the building

2655
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,440
is minimization

2656
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,520
teleological

2657
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,639
and is that in the fep's claims or what

2658
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,320
other claims are coming to the table if

2659
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,280
it's not part of fep in the strict sense

2660
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,560
this is thomas's favorite question

2661
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,960
i didn't know

2662
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,520
my favorite question is that um in that

2663
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,679
i've asked it before

2664
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:16,400
several times

2665
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,080
and what's lyrical about it

2666
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,800
um

2667
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,960
i mean it is a it is a

2668
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,040
tricky question in this place i mean to

2669
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,360
some extent the answer to the

2670
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,679
big bold question is both

2671
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,600
um

2672
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,960
and i think

2673
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,400
it's also worth asking the question is

2674
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,920
it useful um so

2675
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,880
the the reason we've spoken about it

2676
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,480
quite a lot in the past and one of the

2677
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,000
one of the reasons has come up is that

2678
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,639
in some of the the recent formulations

2679
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:51,119
we've dealt with in in some other papers

2680
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,040
that we've been discussing

2681
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,360
um is

2682
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,840
that the free energy or the gradient

2683
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,960
flows have been on some

2684
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,600
normally steady state density

2685
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,239
that can be interpretable as a

2686
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,760
generative model of sorts or as a

2687
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,000
marginal likelihood

2688
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,600
and

2689
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,080
now the the challenge is that a marginal

2690
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,639
likelihood

2691
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,280
in itself is not necessary or is it is i

2692
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,719
suppose a special case of the free

2693
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:21,679
energy

2694
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,360
when the

2695
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,800
variational density that we were

2696
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,159
speaking about earlier you know this

2697
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,840
tractable part of the optimization

2698
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,679
problem um

2699
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,119
is exactly equal to a true posterior

2700
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:35,360
density once we've performed both in

2701
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,880
infants

2702
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,679
so

2703
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,920
the question we've often asked is

2704
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,119
whether

2705
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:41,840
the

2706
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,000
whether that's kale diversions whether

2707
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,840
there's divergence between our

2708
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,080
approximate distribution our variational

2709
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,920
distribution and our

2710
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,119
true exact bayesian solution

2711
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:54,000
and

2712
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,080
whether if that is defined stipulatively

2713
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,440
as being zero whether there is a

2714
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,639
meaningful

2715
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:01,760
role of free energy minimization as

2716
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,199
being interpretable as influence

2717
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,520
and there are several possible answers

2718
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,760
to that one is that

2719
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,000
that

2720
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,600
that we're really dealing with um

2721
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,960
the

2722
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,239
when we're when we're engaging in

2723
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,840
computational neuroscience we're dealing

2724
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,560
with a attractable approximation to how

2725
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,199
systems behave so it's useful from the

2726
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,560
perspective of a computational

2727
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,400
neuroscientist to be able to write it

2728
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,040
down into the free energy functional

2729
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,440
and but not necessarily

2730
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,960
treat that as a literal description of

2731
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,639
what brains and sentient creatures are

2732
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,880
doing in terms of the variation free

2733
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,239
energy aspect

2734
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,600
we could still interpret the marginal

2735
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,639
likelihood

2736
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:43,920
as before

2737
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,600
or interpret graded flows and margin

2738
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,159
likelihood as before

2739
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:50,880
and another answer to it is that

2740
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,840
part of

2741
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,000
what makes inference work particularly

2742
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,320
in a dynamical setting is not going to

2743
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,400
the bottom of a free energy minimum but

2744
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,320
it's finding a way of staying there

2745
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,080
and so that depends upon the ability to

2746
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,320
predict and the ability to represent

2747
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,320
some dynamics of how a system's evolving

2748
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,400
at time over time so it's a question of

2749
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,080
staying at the bottom of the marble

2750
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,280
staying at the bottom of the valley and

2751
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,320
not deviating up the sides

2752
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,080
and we could interpret that as a form of

2753
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,480
inference as well and here we then deal

2754
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,440
with

2755
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,199
flows that are not necessarily up or

2756
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:22,000
down

2757
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,600
free energy gradients or marginal

2758
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,840
likelihood gradients but are

2759
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,199
maintaining the same level or staying at

2760
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,960
the bottom of the valley and that's

2761
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,320
often what we refer to in terms of the

2762
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,000
solenoidal flows

2763
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
and this links back to a lot of the

2764
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,040
discussion we're having about

2765
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,840
deterministic versus um

2766
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,159
sort of chaotic dynamics i should call i

2767
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:45,040
suppose deterministic chaos where um

2768
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,719
systems can behave in a range of

2769
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,239
different ways it's very different

2770
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:49,600
difficult to capture if you're just

2771
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,239
going up and down probability gradients

2772
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,880
so it talks about how we go around

2773
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,400
probability gradients how we circle

2774
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:00,320
around the hill or or along the valley

2775
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,560
and the potentially chaotic way that we

2776
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,760
we do that

2777
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,800
and that

2778
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,400
results in a form of prediction it

2779
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,600
results in a

2780
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,840
a way of staying at the bottom of the

2781
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,239
valley and not um not leaving it so we

2782
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,159
could interpret that as a form of

2783
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,960
imprints as well

2784
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,639
and i think there probably are still

2785
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,400
some open questions as to whether

2786
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,760
whether um

2787
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,000
under certain circumstances it looks as

2788
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,679
if we are also minimizing this kale

2789
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,520
divergence part this

2790
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,050
divergence between the

2791
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,280
[Music]

2792
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,600
approximate and exact

2793
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,159
basin posteriors

2794
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,360
and i

2795
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,040
i think that's still open i think

2796
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,800
plausibly there will be ways of writing

2797
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,000
things down that look as if they're

2798
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:42,960
doing that

2799
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,400
it may be that

2800
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,199
it's

2801
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:48,480
simply a useful approximation to how we

2802
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,480
tend to um

2803
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,920
a useful approximation that we can

2804
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,239
tractably write down and simulate and

2805
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,119
perform computational neuroscience with

2806
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,440
the third possibility is that

2807
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,920
if the brain is realized or evolved to

2808
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,560
realize that things in the world behave

2809
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,560
in the way we've been describing

2810
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,280
it could plausibly be a mechanism or

2811
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,520
variational inference type

2812
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,880
approaches could be a mechanism that the

2813
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,360
brain has evolved to use to model its

2814
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,040
environment as well

2815
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,840
um which would bring back this idea of

2816
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,560
explicit variational free energy

2817
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,080
and so i think there are several

2818
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,600
different possibilities i think there's

2819
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,360
still probably an ongoing discussion

2820
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,840
about a lot of this

2821
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,639
and for me the idea of inference and

2822
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,320
variational inference has to be one

2823
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,480
where the tail divergence is

2824
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,320
decreasing over time

2825
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,000
where uh it's not something that we

2826
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,480
necessarily keep static

2827
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,760
which might mean that variational

2828
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,520
inference is is

2829
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,800
um

2830
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:47,920
not something that's necessarily

2831
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,119
happening in the systems we've been

2832
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:50,719
describing so far

2833
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,880
um but whether it could be something

2834
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,239
that could be interpreted in terms of

2835
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,920
the flow of internal states towards

2836
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,000
their most likely value and another

2837
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,199
aspect of that

2838
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:00,239
or whether it's simply a good

2839
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:01,520
approximation

2840
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:02,960
i'm sure carl will have other things to

2841
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,600
say on this because i've not given a

2842
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,440
definitive or a clear answer one way or

2843
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,639
the other here

2844
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,040
um for me variation influence occurs

2845
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,560
when the kl divergence is shrinking

2846
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,960
however you could also argue that

2847
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,639
marginal likelihoods in the optimization

2848
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,400
of marginal likelihood is itself a form

2849
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,080
of bayesian inference and more akin to

2850
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,920
sort of model selection

2851
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,360
certainly it feeds into the idea of

2852
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,199
active influence in terms of acting upon

2853
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:28,960
the world to maximize

2854
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:29,679
the

2855
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,760
fit between the model of the world and

2856
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,280
that that element is certainly there

2857
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,480
excellent

2858
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,719
and then blue will each have a last

2859
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:42,880
thought and next week at the same time

2860
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,000
we'll continue with 45.2 but for now

2861
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,480
carl and then blue our

2862
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,639
last thoughts on what thomas just added

2863
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,639
or anything else

2864
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,400
you know i think he's absolutely right

2865
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,320
i mean i think it's more interesting to

2866
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,119
ask the question isn't it um i i think

2867
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:01,280
it's largely from the point of view of

2868
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,679
the way the world works i think it's the

2869
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,840
fep interpretation is largely

2870
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,880
technological window dressing

2871
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,840
but i think it's incredibly useful to

2872
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,280
have that

2873
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,600
cheap and cheerful and doable kind of

2874
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,119
window dressing when you actually want

2875
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:20,239
to build artifacts that behave

2876
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,480
as creatures who are autopoetic and have

2877
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,639
a homeostasis and have make the right

2878
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,440
kinds of decisions

2879
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,559
awesome

2880
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,280
first thomas or carl any last thoughts

2881
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,719
and then blue and then all clothes

2882
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,400
just to say thank you for organizing

2883
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,440
this and

2884
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,559
inviting us to be part of it

2885
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,400
blue

2886
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,280
yeah it was great to have you guys here

2887
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,000
and um i definitely had some questions

2888
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,320
that um i've been wondering about for a

2889
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,400
long time resolved so

2890
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:01,599
um that was really great

2891
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,480
yes this was an excellent discussion and

2892
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,119
we sometimes think about the dot zero

2893
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:09,040
as almost like preparing the marble i

2894
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,320
don't know if it's blowing it out of

2895
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,159
glass or just bringing it to the edge of

2896
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,800
the bathtub and the dot zero we just

2897
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,159
walk through

2898
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:18,560
in the order as it was laid out and try

2899
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,440
to follow the traces and understand some

2900
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,320
of the causal dynamics at play behind

2901
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,040
the writing and then in the dot one

2902
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,360
we're in kind of like this plane and so

2903
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,440
there's little micro variations some

2904
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,159
local scents to be made but i really

2905
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,199
appreciated how we opened up a lot of

2906
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,960
threads and also covered a lot of the

2907
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,679
key aspects of the paper

2908
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:43,199
and then we'll be

2909
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,960
looking forward to the dot too when we

2910
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,080
get to climb or descend or

2911
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,239
circumambulate and continue the

2912
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:51,520
discussion so

2913
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,840
thanks again to carl and thomas and all

2914
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,440
the other authors for this great paper

2915
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,440
and thank you blue and brock for the dot

2916
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,560
zero

2917
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,679
see you next week

2918
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,679
bye

2919
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,080
you
