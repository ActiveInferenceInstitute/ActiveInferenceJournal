00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
hello welcome everyone

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
it is

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
action livestream number 45.2

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,640
it's june 8th 2022. welcome carl

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
and we are having our third discussion

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
on the 45

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
so welcome to the active lab everyone

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
we're a participatory online lab that is

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
applied active inference

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
this is a recorded and an archive live

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
stream so please provide us with

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
feedback so we can improve our work all

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
and we'll be following video etiquette

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
for live streams

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
head over to activeinference.org to

20
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
learn more about the live streams and

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
other projects that are happening in

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
actin flab

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
we're in active stream number 45.2

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
it's the third discussion of the paper

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
the free energy principle made simpler

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
but not too simple

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
the first author has joined so thank you

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,360
very much for that

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,680
and we're going to be

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
discussing the paper and related topics

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,479
so if you're watching live

32
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,720
feel free to write questions and

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
comments in the live chat and we'll try

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,040
to address it if it's within the regime

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,399
of attention

36
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,280
otherwise we'll just briefly say hello

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
and then

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
dive in to any number of places

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
so just to begin we can say hi and we

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
can just mention something we're excited

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,719
about or something we liked or

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,560
remembered or something that we might

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,079
want to resolve by the end of the

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
discussion

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
california and i think there was one

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
question that was submitted by brock

48
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,599
that i would very much like to get into

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
and also understand the uh role of mass

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
and inertia for some of these

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
statistical distributions it's blue

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
hi i'm blue i'm a researcher in new

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,080
mexico

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
and uh i have you know probably 100

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
million questions

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
but uh one one that's been bugging a

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
long time about

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
internal states and sensory states

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
and the influence

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
whether it's reciprocal or not so

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
okay and carl anything you'd like to

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
begin with or lead off

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
um

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
well i'm carl

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
and

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
as the free energy principle on this

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
particular one and a bit of focus on

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
curiosity i'm curious to know what

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,879
you're curious about so i was just

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
trying to remember blue's question there

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
and how i would uh however how i would

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
provide a clear answer to it

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
that's what i find fun answering the

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,599
questions

75
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
let's um start with a question about

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
curiosity and then blue you can ask the

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,560
question you had where is curiosity in

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
these curious particles

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,799
they

80
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,319
are um

81
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
technically

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,480
an expression of curiosity uh is an

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
expression of the imperative to select

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
those courses of action or policies

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,560
that

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
yield the greatest information gain

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
and they are

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
properties of certain particles not all

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
particles but certain particles

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
interestingly

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,159
the

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,000
kinds of particles that conform or look

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
as if they are

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
behaving in a way to maximize their

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
information gain or minimize their

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
uncertainty about

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,040
states that are external to their

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
markov blanket are those that show very

99
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,640
precise dynamics um

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
usually associated with

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,599
larger particles things like you and me

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,478
so

103
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
if you work through

104
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,358
the physics and the

105
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
dynamics

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
that particles

107
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
who preserve their markov blanket

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
have and make the further

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
assumption that you're looking at a

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,840
large

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
classical light particle that conforms

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
to classical mechanics

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
then you can demonstrate that the

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
um active states the way that it acts

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
upon the environment

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
um are the product of

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
beliefs about action

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
that where that render

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
the most likely actions those that

120
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
maximize information gain

121
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,039
so that's as that's

122
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,240
um a technical answer um for me

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
mathematically it's all fairly

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
straightforward but i imagine it might

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
be a bit mysterious for

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
if you don't know the underlying mouths

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
okay great start so blue to your

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
question

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,840
so

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
this is something that i've read many

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
times before but but

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
since i have the opportunity to

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,479
interrogate you about it now i i think

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
it's a good chance

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,199
so

136
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
here it says

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,199
particular partitions can be defined in

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
terms of sparse coupling perhaps the

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
simplest definition that guarantees a

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
markov blanket is as follows

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
external states only influence sensory

142
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
states and internal states only

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
influence active states

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
and i find this troubling and i found a

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,759
troubling

146
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
often in the past because i feel like

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
internal states can influence

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
sensory states

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,240
like especially in the circumstance

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
where someone takes lsd your sensory

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,919
states are totally then influenced by

152
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,680
your internal

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
like state of what's going on um

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
like is it like poking holes in the

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
markov blanket or

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,720
what is happening when uh

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
the internal states i feel have a great

158
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
ability to influence the senses

159
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
right i like the notion of poking holes

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
in your mark off blanket that's

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
something you wouldn't really want to do

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,800
too much if you were that markov blanket

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
um because that would

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
basically destroy the the markov blanket

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
um

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
and interestingly uh much of uh you know

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,680
i i conceive of much of neuroscience is

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,280
trying to sort of peer through the mark

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
of blanket and sometimes you do poke

170
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,080
holes in markov blankets for example in

171
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
invasive electrophysiology for example

172
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
you know actually so get inside and look

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
at the internal states but it answered

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
your question uh which is you know i

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
think quite an astute question um

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
those kinds of effects would be mediated

177
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
technically about what we call active

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,319
states

179
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
so it is certainly possible that you can

180
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,000
um

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
alter the gain or the sensitivity of

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
your sensory states and your effect your

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
receptor organs

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
but that effect is mediated by an active

185
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
state so if you look um again at that

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
sort of influence diagram little arrows

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,199
in it

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
you will see that there is a vicarious

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,720
path

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
in which the internal states can have an

191
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,919
effect and sometimes a profound effect

192
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
on the responsiveness or the sensory

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
states per se but usually what that

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
translates into is the sensitivity of

195
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
the responsiveness of sensory states to

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
external states so um in the

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
instance of psychedelics for example um

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
you you might construe that as um

199
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,080
if the drug was acting

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,039
at the level of the retina for example

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,479
that might be um

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
activating

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
certain active states that are

204
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
mediating um attention attention-like

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,840
phenomena at a very very low level

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,759
probably not the best explanation with

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
psychedelics i you know i i would

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
contend that

209
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,599
as anything that affects your perception

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,960
is really

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
something that can be

212
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
understood as

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
a different kind of

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,839
belief updating or perceptual synthesis

215
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
given the same sensory information so

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
i'll come back to you and ask you know

217
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,279
well what did you mean by um i know that

218
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,519
my internal states can affect my sensory

219
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,480
states

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
and you might

221
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
do you really mean your sensory states

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
do you actually mean the rate at which

223
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
your

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
photo receptors or your um

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,760
any of your sensory receptors are

226
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
actually firing or did you really mean

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
the sense making that ensues from the

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,600
same sensory input due to some internal

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
um

230
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,560
we sometimes call it internal action but

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
your some internal

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
dynamics that

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
change the belief updating and change

234
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
the kind of thing explanation you bring

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
to the table for this particular pattern

236
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
of sensory input

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
yes and

238
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
so i think it's i think it's a little

239
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,680
bit of both i think uh

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,200
especially like i like i think of some

241
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
um i i i feel like it's maybe uh mdma

242
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
that affects like the um the way that

243
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
your eyes move in in your head like it

244
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
literally affects like your your um

245
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
the eyes stockades

246
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
so

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
i i would think that like i guess that's

248
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
involuntary action so i guess then it

249
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,320
does

250
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
impact the action even though the action

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
is involuntary

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
i guess that makes sense so well yes

253
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,519
i just endorse that that makes perfect

254
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
sense yeah i noticed what you've done is

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
you you you're talking exclusively about

256
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,480
action your health reaching the world um

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
and that obviously underwrites the

258
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
sense-making um but of course that's not

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
internal states affecting the sensory

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,120
input it's affecting the way that we

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,959
palpate the world and the sensory input

262
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,360
that we get and in a sense that that's

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
the you know one way in which we express

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
our curious behavior that we actually

265
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
palpate uh volitionally or sub

266
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,720
personally the world with our eyes with

267
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,440
our with us you know sense receptors in

268
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,839
our skin uh and even our intraceptive um

269
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
receptors that you know mediate those

270
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
gut feelings the these can all be

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
deployed in particular ways but these

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
are a reflections of acting on um

273
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
acting on the world

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
in order to produce different kinds of

275
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
sensations so that you know

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
that answer i think um sort of

277
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
highlights exactly that sparse coupling

278
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
that um underwrites the statistical

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
separation of internal from external

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
states

281
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
give me another example i think them

282
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,640
the ones that are sort of

283
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
counter-intuitive or sort of violations

284
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,519
the most useful to drill down on uh you

285
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
know

286
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
so like i think of extreme circumstances

287
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
also not just like psychedelics but but

288
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,360
you know when you're absolutely parched

289
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
uh

290
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
like so when you're absolutely punched

291
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,279
you're absolutely famished

292
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
so

293
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
um

294
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
the food smells so much better

295
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
when you're absolutely

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
starving so so that that's another

297
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
example of how like my internal states

298
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
you know i feel like affect your sensory

299
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
perception

300
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
that's a great example as well

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,920
so i would read that example um

302
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
um yeah it makes a number of excellent

303
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,320
points that certainly the the

304
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,880
the the salience of certain sensory cues

305
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,360
in different um

306
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
states of being that you you yourself

307
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
infer

308
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,279
will be

309
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,560
very context dependent so

310
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
you're a nice example the smooth your

311
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
the food smells nice when you're hungry

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
but to if you like articulate that and

313
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,720
to realize that

314
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,079
and also

315
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
make plans in terms of what you're going

316
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
to do about being hungry you or you have

317
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
to have an internal representation not

318
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
just of

319
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
niceness

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
but also being hungry you know to

321
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
recognize that you are hungry

322
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,639
so i think that example

323
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
almost paradoxically speaks to extremely

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
high level internal states trying to

325
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
make sense of all of these interceptive

326
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,320
um cues that are coming in

327
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
so that's a nice example um

328
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
of interceptive inference so in the same

329
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
way we try to make sense of the patterns

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
of visual input in terms of what caused

331
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
that what's the best explanation for

332
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,160
this particular pattern is it a face is

333
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
it a bird

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
at very low levels is it an edge

335
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
all those rules in principle should also

336
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
apply to

337
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
the patent inputs you get from your

338
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
autonomic nervous system your

339
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous

340
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
system and all the receptors

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
that i repeat literally report your cup

342
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,240
feelings and you have to make sense of

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
that and some your creatures like you

344
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,320
and me

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,199
um

346
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,519
can make sense of it by bringing these

347
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
very high level hypotheses like i am in

348
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
a state of hunger or i am hungry but

349
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,959
this is just another percept you know

350
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
and it's as you know um

351
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,639
has the same status as the percept of a

352
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,560
face you know a face is a sufficient

353
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,839
explanation for what i'm currently

354
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,839
seeing and enables me to make all sorts

355
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,760
of predictions about what's going to

356
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
happen uh in terms of you know looking

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
at that face and hearing the sounds

358
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
emanating from that face

359
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,120
knowing that i am hungry also has

360
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
enormous benefit in the sense that it

361
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,760
now constrains or provides or conditions

362
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,519
certain prior beliefs about what i'm

363
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,199
likely to do next

364
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
including these mental actions that

365
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
enable me to attend to certain cues as

366
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
opposed to other cues and i think it's

367
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,120
really the smelling nice um

368
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
part and parcel of that is that you are

369
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,560
actually attending to olfactory input

370
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
but in order to do that you've got to

371
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
recognize that the most likely thing i

372
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
am likely to do as a hungry creature who

373
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,920
knows that she's hungry is attend to my

374
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
old factory input so the mechanism of

375
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
attention

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
interestingly gets into this

377
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
into your example as well

378
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
um and that's yeah yeah i think that's a

379
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
nice observation

380
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
in the sense that many people

381
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
think that the um

382
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
that attention

383
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
is a kind of mental action it's an

384
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,079
internal action it's sort of basically

385
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,320
um appealing to this notion of markov

386
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
blankets within markov blankets within

387
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
the brain and certain high levels acting

388
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
upon

389
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,279
lower levels just to set the gain you

390
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,639
know if you're telling a predictive

391
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
coding stories will be the precision of

392
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
certain um

393
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,720
signals in a folk psychology um rhetoric

394
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,759
this would be the salience of your of uh

395
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,560
of particular um

396
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,360
certain modalities of input that are

397
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
whole precise information for you at

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
that point in time that resolve

399
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
uncertainty about the state that you're

400
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
in hungry happy

401
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
uh fearful you know whatever you know

402
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
all of these things have to be inferred

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,759
and recognized by the blue updating and

404
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,160
the um the dynamics of the internal

405
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
states

406
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,480
okay

407
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
um first welcome thomas

408
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
uh greetings

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
talk a little bit about action and how

410
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,680
action integrates these complex nested

411
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
chains of of causal narratives so we

412
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
talked about different perturbations

413
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,079
whether it's a pharmacological

414
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,959
intervention or some optogenetic or

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,240
something like that

416
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
there could be a modification at the

417
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,360
level of the retina

418
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,920
and that's directly modifying the sense

419
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,639
states so there we don't need to appeal

420
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,880
to any internal states changing to

421
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
change perceptions like you're seeing

422
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,279
something different when there's

423
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,360
different light on the retina

424
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,320
then

425
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,079
as was mentioned there might be

426
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,000
modification of active states of

427
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,639
oculomotor behavior and then carl you

428
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
just brought it to the idea of attention

429
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
as a mental action

430
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,839
and so looking back at the the

431
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,639
partitioning in this figure

432
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,399
the particular states

433
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,559
are the internal states mu and the

434
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
blanket so that's the whole particle as

435
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,359
it moves around that's the entity as

436
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,959
distinguished from

437
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,480
the environment

438
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,119
but there's special attention paid to

439
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
the autonomous states which are the

440
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,319
active states and the internal states

441
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
and it's almost like these are the ones

442
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,599
where control can be applied either in

443
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,640
this terms of direct ocular motor action

444
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
or

445
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
the possibility of attention as mental

446
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
action and so sense cannot be directly

447
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
controlled but

448
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
in this strange loop way

449
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,919
it is what uncertainty is being reduced

450
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,080
about which is the outcomes of the

451
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
observations

452
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
and so distinguishing these different

453
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
subsets of the partitions

454
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,919
like the particular states being the

455
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,840
entity the particle and then the

456
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
autonomous states being the ones that

457
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
have special control degrees of freedom

458
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
and the blanket states being the ones

459
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,200
that intermediate or make the internal

460
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
and external states conditionally

461
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,679
independent each of these subsets

462
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,200
and maybe even other

463
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
subsets

464
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,559
have um special roles in understanding

465
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,440
different

466
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
cognitive

467
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,160
informal phenomena like curiosity or

468
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
drive and motivation and so on

469
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
um and then also the example with the

470
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
food i am hungry and then i thought

471
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
about what if someone had to believe i

472
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
am fasting

473
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
and that food smells good but it would

474
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
not be pleasant if my fast were ruined

475
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
by this sensory outcome

476
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
so there's even degrees of cognitive

477
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
action

478
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
beyond

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,520
impulsively following

480
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,880
drives that are of one sensory mode

481
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
um

482
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
thomas would you like to say hi or

483
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,360
remark on anything you're seeing here or

484
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
anywhere else

485
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,479
or there's some questions in the chat

486
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,799
um

487
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
so as with last time i apologize a bit

488
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
late joining

489
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,840
ran over a little bit at the hospital

490
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
so lots of things on the slide that

491
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
certainly i'm interested in thinking

492
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
about the roles of attention and

493
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
and you mentioned the word salience as

494
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,240
well

495
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
um and i guess the thing i might pick up

496
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
on it is that

497
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
um

498
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
in relation to the the idea that

499
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
attention can be a form of action

500
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
and is that we can think about

501
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
we can think about the things that are

502
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
salient as being things that are worthy

503
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
of attending to worthy of um performing

504
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
that action that then obtains those

505
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
sorts of data

506
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,160
which

507
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
i find quite a useful way of

508
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
thinking about the relationship between

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,840
those two terms and a way of

510
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
understanding what we mean when we talk

511
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
about

512
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
um savings or attention and there's

513
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
those sorts of things

514
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
um and for me this is one of the

515
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
big motivations for

516
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
[Music]

517
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
using computational neuroscience methods

518
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
for using mathematical modeling as a way

519
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
of trying to describe what's going on in

520
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
that a lot of these terms are used

521
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
interchangeably and with very different

522
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
meanings by different authors in a lot

523
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,400
of the cognitive sciences and it's quite

524
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
useful to be able to pin that down to

525
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
something mathematical and unambiguous

526
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
that says what i'm talking about is this

527
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
you may use the second word for

528
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
something something different but at

529
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
least we can be clear on what is meant

530
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
by it here

531
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
and so for me it's one of the things

532
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
that i found got me interested in active

533
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,640
inference in the first place this idea

534
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
of being able to formalize things in

535
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
psychology in

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,840
a very precise

537
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,520
way that makes me think of

538
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,159
pinning insects and sometimes by just

539
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
pinning a few parts of them

540
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
the whole pose might be

541
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
stabilized

542
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
and then other times you might pin this

543
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
bug

544
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,840
and somebody else says well i have this

545
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,640
one that's floating around

546
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
it could be pinned down

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
or

548
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,760
just trying to walk this path between

549
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
being clear about how the terms are used

550
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
but not partitioning ourself off and

551
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
saying well we're ignoring

552
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,880
the casual use of the english word

553
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
surprise

554
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,679
or

555
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,919
belief or curiosity or attention or

556
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,919
salience and we're just going to call

557
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,360
that string

558
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,720
onto this other formalism so how to

559
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
navigate the way that sometimes the

560
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
formalisms do have

561
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
uh

562
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
words

563
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
that tag them

564
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,640
like risk or ambiguity and how to be

565
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,799
clear about something yet when the term

566
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,960
itself may not have sharp distinctions

567
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,640
maybe a lot is cut out or is not um

568
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,360
fully encompassed by that

569
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
definition and has issues with then

570
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,000
people taking an unrelated issue or

571
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
definition of that word

572
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
and projecting that back onto the

573
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,918
formalism

574
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
yes and as you say i think it aids with

575
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
translation to quite a large degree as

576
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,880
well and

577
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
and it's not just shutting yourself off

578
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
with one specific

579
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,919
definition that's different to everybody

580
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
else's it's a way of saying how can we

581
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
how can we actually relate all these

582
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,039
things together and see if there are

583
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
multiple different terms that are used

584
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,159
that apply to the same underlying

585
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,720
construct

586
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
blue would you like to ask anything or i

587
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,960
can go to a question in the chat

588
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,720
go ahead let's go to the chat

589
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
okay i'm gonna ask one shorter question

590
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,400
while preparing another longer one so

591
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
ali asks

592
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,799
how can seemingly irrational

593
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,760
non-optimal behavior

594
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
in some organisms be accounted for in

595
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,200
active inference different types of

596
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
non-optimal or seemingly irrational

597
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
behavior whether altruism or making

598
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
mistakes

599
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,520
how can these behaviors be understood

600
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,360
within a behavioral optimality framework

601
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
did you have any thoughts on that one

602
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,360
first

603
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
um

604
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
thinking about

605
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,159
balls rolling to the bottom of bowls

606
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,080
one could say

607
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,120
i don't like where this ball rolled

608
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,080
or

609
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
i wish things had been different so it

610
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
wouldn't have rolled that way

611
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
but given where the ball starts

612
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
and the structure of the landscape

613
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,520
it's just playing out a certain way

614
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
so if somebody has

615
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,039
a very strong aversion to risk

616
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
maybe even with the total accurate

617
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,960
information they could still make a

618
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,320
decision where the outcomes are

619
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,080
post hoc perceived as sub-optimal due to

620
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
an extreme attention being paid to the

621
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,200
possibility of a downside a one percent

622
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
chance you lose one dollar but there's a

623
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
99 chance that you get a hundred dollars

624
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
but if you're paying a lot of attention

625
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
to that one percent chance of loss maybe

626
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
that causes somebody to not engage in

627
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
this offer that in the mean field or in

628
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,720
this sort of

629
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
other way or other set of priors other

630
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
attention would be quite relevant so

631
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
um

632
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
given how things are set up they play

633
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
out a certain way and we don't need to

634
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,279
take that too much onto the determinism

635
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,640
path but given a set of priors bayes

636
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640
optimal or variational bayes utilizing

637
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,120
organisms or those we model as such may

638
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,039
get to outcomes that don't always result

639
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,600
in them achieving their even specified

640
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,918
goals

641
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
blue

642
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
i think about it in terms of uh the old

643
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
expression if you want to go

644
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,919
fast go alone and if you want to go far

645
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,080
go together

646
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
it's it's cooperation

647
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
and and really in the

648
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
effort of achieving any goal

649
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
um i think that the

650
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
altruistic behavior in terms of of

651
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
cooperation well it's

652
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,880
not always

653
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
really seen that way i think overall

654
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,360
um

655
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
it it is that way so so i mean while

656
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
giving ten dollars to a homeless person

657
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,039
in your community might be you know

658
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
depriving you of ten dollars

659
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
it's also

660
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,960
giving that person the opportunity to

661
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
you know have a meal or whatever

662
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
um

663
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
it just is it's in our nature to be

664
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,559
cooperative whether it's gonna directly

665
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,000
benefit us

666
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
or not because it's only through things

667
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,679
like cooperation that we can build

668
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
rocket ships and

669
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,279
you know be sitting here today

670
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,200
discussing this paper so we wouldn't

671
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
have affordances like the internet if we

672
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
didn't um instinctively cooperate

673
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
regardless whether it directly benefits

674
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
us or not

675
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
great point about the scale mattering

676
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
you zoom in why is that liver cell

677
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,440
giving up all the glucose isn't glucose

678
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,640
[Music]

679
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
something important or pragmatic value

680
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,279
for that cell and it can be true and it

681
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
can be playing a service at a higher

682
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,320
level so

683
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,960
thomas or carl

684
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
i was just going to pick up on on your

685
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
analogy or your metaphor with the bulls

686
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
rolling

687
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,360
into the different balls

688
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,559
and

689
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
i thought that was quite a nice way of

690
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,400
putting it in the sense that

691
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
the optimum trajectory of a ball rolling

692
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
into a bowl

693
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,360
um

694
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
for any given bowl

695
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,120
is effectively going to be the most

696
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,279
likely path it takes

697
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,559
now of course

698
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,760
you could

699
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
you could swap that bowl for a bowl of a

700
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
completely different shape

701
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
um and you would get a completely

702
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
different trajectory so what might seem

703
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,799
optimal as a trajectory for one bowl

704
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
might seem completely sub-optimal for

705
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,919
another

706
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,279
and

707
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,799
there's a question that comes up here a

708
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
lot in terms of thinking about

709
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
psychopathology or disease processes

710
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,039
where people say well how is it that you

711
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
can describe that as as engaging in

712
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,039
optimal behavior because clearly what's

713
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,120
happening is so far from the optimum

714
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
and suppose the answer is that

715
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,240
you're

716
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
referencing optimality with reference to

717
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,279
the wrong bull

718
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,360
and you need to think about what what is

719
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
the objective function whenever we're

720
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
talking about optimality we need to say

721
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,080
what what is it we're measuring

722
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
optimality in relation to

723
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
in active influence clearly the

724
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
objective function is always going to be

725
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,279
a free energy function

726
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,760
but the specific priors that go into

727
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,919
making up that free energy function will

728
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
have a big impact on the shape of the

729
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,279
free energy landscape and therefore

730
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
where we're going to end up moving the

731
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
kind of trajectories we're going to have

732
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
and

733
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,320
so it turns around the question of

734
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,399
saying is something optimal it says

735
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,559
given that it is optional

736
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,399
what is the appropriate objective

737
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,840
function defined in terms of the

738
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,720
appropriate price

739
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
thank you carl

740
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,919
yes just to um reinforce all of those

741
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,600
answers um

742
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,640
and provide a succinct way of responding

743
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,039
to this um important question what is

744
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,480
the relationship between active

745
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,840
inference and bounded or

746
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,159
um optimal uh behavior

747
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
so one way to um

748
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
answer that question

749
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
is just to

750
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,159
query the nature of

751
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,799
optimal behavior and bounded rationality

752
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,120
as it's usually defined in behavioral

753
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,039
economics and sometimes in sort of

754
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,159
behavioral psychology um

755
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,240
and

756
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,919
one theorem which brings those kinds of

757
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,000
formulation into question is called the

758
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,080
complete plus theorem

759
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,360
and what that says is that for any pair

760
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,120
of loss functions and behaviors

761
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,399
there exists a set of priors that render

762
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
that behavior bayes optimal

763
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
so to translate that into the current

764
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,039
conversation what that means is active

765
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,360
inference can describe

766
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,120
any behavior

767
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,039
in terms of bayes optimality um

768
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,320
given

769
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,159
any loss functions

770
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,240
uh if you allow for different priors so

771
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,200
what that tells you is it's it the the

772
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,840
notion of

773
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,600
sub-optimality um is itself a little bit

774
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,919
suspect all you're saying is that there

775
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,120
are um unique prizes that explain this

776
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,240
behavior

777
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
and what you normally end up realizing

778
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,880
is that bayes optimality in the general

779
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,200
sense of active inference

780
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
is not a way of prescribing optimal

781
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880
behavior it's a way of describing it

782
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
and that description

783
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,440
requires an identification specification

784
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,279
of the prize in the generative model

785
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,720
which is effectively what thomas has

786
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
just said

787
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
and indeed practical applications of

788
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
active inference

789
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,880
to

790
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
say in the context of computational

791
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,080
psychiatry are just that they are just

792
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
using active inference

793
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,840
in order to summarize or to understand

794
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,559
or characterize a particular person

795
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,320
in terms of the prime beliefs they are

796
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,840
bringing to the table

797
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
given um

798
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,480
their

799
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,120
behavior and given their their sensory

800
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,559
states and you're usually using some

801
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,279
kind of economic scheme so i think the

802
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
key thing here is that

803
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,840
the principles um that underwrite active

804
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,799
inference are there to describe not to

805
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,679
prescribe just in the same sense that

806
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,919
hamilton's principles principle of least

807
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,840
action

808
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
will describe how a

809
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
ball travels through the air or a

810
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,960
massive body or the or the um the ball

811
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,279
in the um in the bowl that you were just

812
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,480
discussing and it does not

813
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
prescribe optimal behavior until you

814
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,799
specify the shape of the bowl

815
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,360
the particular prize at hand which will

816
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
be

817
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,200
or you're by definition different for

818
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,840
every particle every creature and every

819
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
person so there is no optimality in the

820
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
sense that there is a right way to

821
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
behave it's always conditioned on the

822
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,960
prior beliefs of the of the person that

823
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
you're talking to

824
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,440
there's a further twist here which

825
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
moves on from expected utility theory

826
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,240
and i'd also suggest bounded rationality

827
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,760
which is the the

828
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
um the objective function that

829
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,919
underwrites choice behavior

830
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,159
and planning

831
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,159
has two aspects to it it's got the

832
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,080
expected information gain and the

833
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
expected cost or the negative expected

834
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
utility

835
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
but the expected information gain

836
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
depends upon what you currently believe

837
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
which means that the optimal way to

838
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,679
behave

839
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,360
depends upon what you believe in this

840
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
moment so there is no if you like

841
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,480
invariant optimal response because it's

842
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
always conditioned upon what you know at

843
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,080
the moment so there may be times when

844
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,120
you um behave in a way that seems to

845
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
ignore your prior preferences

846
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,600
in order to resolve some uncertainty and

847
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,519
there'll be other times when that will

848
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,760
be less the uncertainty be less if you

849
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,799
like um potent in determining what the

850
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,799
best next thing or the most likely thing

851
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,320
you're going to do

852
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,200
next

853
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
so

854
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
i

855
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,840
i i think active inference gracefully

856
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
subsumes

857
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,559
um

858
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,679
bounded and optimal behavior

859
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,200
but as special cases when you can ignore

860
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,440
the way that we handle uncertainty

861
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,559
awesome and it makes me think of even in

862
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,200
the fully observable chessboard

863
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720
situation

864
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
there still might not be a single best

865
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,960
move

866
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
and so situations with less

867
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,039
observability and more openness in their

868
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,039
affordances it's even more that case so

869
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,159
it's great how you mentioned carl about

870
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,519
the description

871
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,320
rather than the proscription and that um

872
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,080
is followed nicely by a question from

873
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,080
chat so ia roland rodriguez asked

874
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
fristen has said the free energy

875
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,960
principle describes particular existence

876
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,679
maxwell ramstead says storms do not

877
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,159
follow fep while water does

878
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,679
i deduce then

879
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,159
that for fep the stone exists but the

880
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,519
storm does not

881
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,240
is that accurate or otherwise can

882
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,799
anything be said to exist that is not

883
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,600
able to be described by the fep

884
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,480
so

885
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,159
if fep is about describing rather than

886
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,760
proscribing

887
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,159
what can be described with the fvp

888
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,960
that's a difficult question

889
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,719
i'm tempted to get thomas to answer that

890
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,320
well i i'll give him a starter while

891
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
he's gathering his thoughts um

892
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
so yeah fristen has says fep i think

893
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,560
probably ramstead uh talks about did he

894
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,760
talk about storms or stones um because

895
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
interestingly storms

896
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,960
are somewhat difficult to describe

897
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
because defining the markov blanket of a

898
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,079
storm um is not quite so easy as

899
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,199
defining a markov blanket of a stone

900
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,480
so i'm going to assume that we're

901
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,159
talking about stones as opposed to

902
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
storms um

903
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,359
and so the answer would be

904
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
the fep

905
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
applies to

906
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,240
anything

907
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,200
where a thing is defined stipulatively

908
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
in terms of possessing a markov blanket

909
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,599
that enables you to distinguish the

910
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,560
states that belong to the thing

911
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,520
from

912
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,119
any other states so if something exists

913
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,280
then the fep applies does um so that's

914
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
that's one thing that can be said very

915
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,240
very clearly

916
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,880
um the next question is well are there

917
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
different kinds of things um and the

918
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
answer would be yes absolutely and and

919
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
it depends very much upon the causal

920
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
diagrams we're looking at the influence

921
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,160
diagrams that we were looking at before

922
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
in terms of the sparsity of what

923
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
influences what

924
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,359
so

925
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,359
stones

926
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
may be construed as

927
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,280
as markov blankets um

928
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,640
that

929
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,000
don't have any overt active states so

930
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,119
they could be construed as inert things

931
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,440
that where inert things could be

932
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
described as um markov blankets or

933
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
possessing a particular partition which

934
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,920
is another way of saying it possesses a

935
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
markov blanket and

936
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
yeah you can distinguish it from a stone

937
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
from um familiar in which the stone is

938
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,599
found but that particular kind of

939
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,720
particle um or markov blanket

940
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
is inert in the sense it doesn't move

941
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
around very much

942
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,680
if that doesn't move around at all

943
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,960
in an autonomous way so that immediately

944
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,560
distinguishes between

945
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,640
two kinds of particles within without

946
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,680
active states um you can go on sort of

947
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
um

948
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,839
defining different spaces structures and

949
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
different kinds of things and

950
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,200
until we get back to the um

951
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
and daniel you mentioned strange loops

952
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,320
before um and there there is certainly

953
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,200
an interesting strange loop that emerges

954
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680
when when one's active states or one's

955
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
actions are hidden from the internal

956
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
states and what does that mean well it

957
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,520
means that now my active states become

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,920
causes of my sensations but i don't know

959
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,720
that

960
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,079
therefore now because i am i can read my

961
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
internal dynamics

962
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,960
as

963
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,839
belief updating about my the causes of

964
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,160
my sensations i now

965
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,760
um can be read as

966
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,280
forming beliefs

967
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
about the causes of sensations that

968
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,839
include my own actions and at this point

969
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,079
you have a mathematical image of

970
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,040
planning

971
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,960
that you move from things like

972
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,920
thermostats um and viruses through to um

973
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,200
people um and you know anything that has

974
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,440
a sufficiently

975
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
deep or expressive genitive model

976
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,520
to cover its own action so now you get

977
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
into the world

978
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,040
uh kinds of things that look as if they

979
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
engage in

980
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
in planning and sometimes that's framed

981
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
in terms of planning as inference and

982
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
that would be um that would be

983
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,079
an apt way to describe you know a lot of

984
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,400
the you know a lot a lot of the

985
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
biological self-organization we are

986
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,560
interested but not all of it uh you are

987
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,359
you could content the virus doesn't plan

988
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,680
uh you could even contend that

989
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,359
at a different scale evolution doesn't

990
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,680
plan it's not everything

991
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,320
plans but there will be certain kinds of

992
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,160
things mark off blankets particular

993
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,720
petitions that look as if they do plan

994
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
thomas your turn

995
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
i don't know quite what i'm supposed to

996
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,050
add to that um

997
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,680
[Music]

998
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,520
i i suppose

999
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
an alternative perspective on the

1000
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,359
question or well more accurately an

1001
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,280
alternative question is which systems is

1002
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,359
it useful to try and describe with the

1003
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,599
pre-energy principles

1004
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,040
and i think

1005
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
what carl's described in terms of some

1006
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
of the special cases the things that

1007
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,079
you know

1008
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,520
is it useful to describe the stone in

1009
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
terms of the free energy principle

1010
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,400
almost certainly not

1011
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,599
um

1012
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,280
you sort of add in the additional

1013
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
additional baggage and things but it's

1014
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
not really doing any inference of an

1015
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
interesting sort

1016
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,599
um

1017
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,720
and

1018
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,240
perhaps the best way of answering that

1019
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,359
question is to look at the sorts of

1020
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,800
things the free energy principle has

1021
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,160
been applied to

1022
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
and that have found some sort of

1023
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,119
purchase

1024
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,680
clearly looking at um including looking

1025
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,280
at the cognitive neurosciences that's

1026
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
and where it's had a particular impact

1027
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,079
and i would imagine that part of the

1028
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,839
reason for that is that what's so

1029
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,359
interesting about um brains and behavior

1030
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,839
is that what goes on inside a brain is

1031
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,280
uh is

1032
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
um

1033
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,320
almost by definition it is only

1034
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
interesting because it's

1035
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,839
something that relates to what's going

1036
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,599
on outside of that brain

1037
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,800
so

1038
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,560
the whole business of doing neuroscience

1039
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
is about relating internal and external

1040
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
states and the the way in which the clue

1041
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
relate to one another

1042
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,960
and so it's only once you

1043
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
once you start looking at systems like

1044
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,560
that that you you really need to appeal

1045
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,920
to this kind of formalism

1046
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,480
great

1047
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,440
um so just a few uh notes on this

1048
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,599
um

1049
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,920
carl you mentioned different kinds of

1050
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,599
things

1051
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,960
and um

1052
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,920
what

1053
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,760
taxonomies or classification schemes of

1054
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,119
things exist along what dimensions do

1055
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,040
things exist

1056
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,640
and how does

1057
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
the fep

1058
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,480
bring cohesion

1059
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
or highlight tensions in the ways that

1060
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,240
kinds of things have been identified

1061
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
um like

1062
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,520
mental versus

1063
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,640
physical constructs or just a few that

1064
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
were were mentioned

1065
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,760
um different extent of

1066
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
seemingly internal cognitive states

1067
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
then you mentioned

1068
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,880
the difference of the extent of the

1069
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,079
autonomous action

1070
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,119
and then i think what the question and

1071
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,680
it was clarified a bit in the chat about

1072
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,480
the storm and the stone was about

1073
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,480
resistance to dissipation resistance um

1074
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
in its persistence

1075
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,359
so

1076
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,800
where do

1077
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
dissipative

1078
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
persistent

1079
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
regenerative

1080
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,040
propagative

1081
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,720
cascading failing systems

1082
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,839
growing

1083
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,560
systems

1084
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,119
what what how do we think of those

1085
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,359
as different types of things

1086
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
well technically

1087
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
it all boils down to the functional form

1088
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,079
of the dynamics um

1089
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,960
so

1090
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,560
um

1091
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,240
from from the point of view the free

1092
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,839
energy principle i should say that you

1093
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,480
know

1094
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,720
this is a very colloquial view which is

1095
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,960
just emerging you know over the past few

1096
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,079
years and indeed over the past few weeks

1097
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,880
so you know this is not accepted wisdom

1098
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
nor is there any consensus about it but

1099
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,400
if you want to

1100
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
an answer from first principles um

1101
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
then you you start where the free energy

1102
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,119
principle starts which is in the

1103
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,440
dynamics and the the dynamics are

1104
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,040
defined by

1105
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,599
a stochastic differential equation or

1106
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,200
sometimes known as a random dynamical

1107
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,000
system um in physics this is just the uh

1108
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,680
the longevity equation

1109
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,800
um and so any different kind of system

1110
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,760
and implicitly um if there is a thing in

1111
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,960
the system then there has to be a

1112
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
particular partition that you know that

1113
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,160
that's something which is at the heart

1114
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,599
of the free energy principle it's it's

1115
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,560
defining thing that's in terms of the

1116
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,359
ability to separate states of the thing

1117
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,280
from other states so

1118
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
by definition we're talking about markov

1119
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,400
blankets

1120
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,319
and as soon as you write down a

1121
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,480
particular partition that implies or

1122
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,200
requires a markov blanket

1123
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,480
then

1124
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,200
you you have the opportunity now to look

1125
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,040
at the functional form

1126
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
of the influences of different states

1127
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,800
and other states and then you can now if

1128
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,720
you like knock out

1129
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,079
further causal influences to create a

1130
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,440
taxonomy of increasing capacity

1131
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,319
of systems and ask questions what sorts

1132
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,720
of behaviors would these

1133
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,079
more and more sparse um

1134
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,359
systems

1135
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,440
demonstrate and one nice example that

1136
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,280
we've just been discussing

1137
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,079
is if we cut the connection

1138
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,560
in the functional form of the coupling

1139
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,720
amongst the subsets of the particular

1140
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,280
partition between the active states and

1141
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
the internal states

1142
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
so that now the

1143
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,040
active states my action

1144
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,720
now becomes hidden

1145
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,480
from the internal states because it's

1146
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,359
been uncoupled then it becomes a hidden

1147
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,680
cause of my sensations and i get a very

1148
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
different kind of

1149
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
interpretation of the

1150
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,160
internal thoughts in terms of belief

1151
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,640
updating so that's one nice example of

1152
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,280
what would emerge just by thinking about

1153
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
um things

1154
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,000
in terms of their dynamical architecture

1155
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,319
namely the functional form of the

1156
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,240
dynamical coupling between different

1157
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,920
different um different subsets of things

1158
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,319
you also introduced a very important

1159
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,560
another distinction

1160
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,240
so that would be if you like one

1161
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,960
dimension

1162
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,119
[Music]

1163
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,440
along which you would be able to

1164
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,359
elaborate different kinds of things

1165
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,640
different classes of things different

1166
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,119
categories of things of increasing

1167
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,599
sparsity and probably in the increase in

1168
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,240
the sparsity increasing sophistication

1169
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,359
and you're more closer to things like us

1170
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,319
basically you know the sparse you get um

1171
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,480
the the closer you will get to you know

1172
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,440
to to um and you know things that show

1173
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,000
autonomous behavior of of an intentional

1174
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,319
kind that has this planning aspect but

1175
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,160
there's another crucial distinction

1176
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,400
which you uh

1177
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,880
which is the distinction between

1178
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,119
um particular states that are

1179
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,400
dissipative

1180
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,440
versus um conservative now in this

1181
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,480
instance

1182
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,800
for all things that exist for a given

1183
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,480
period of time

1184
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,280
then the markov blanket has to be there

1185
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,599
because that definitionally

1186
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,520
specifies the existence of the thing so

1187
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,079
that's an existential imperative but

1188
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,839
within that

1189
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,640
non-dissipating markov blanket you can

1190
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,839
have

1191
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,240
particular states namely autonomous

1192
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,359
internal active plus sensory states

1193
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,079
that belong to big things and that's

1194
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,800
important because with big things

1195
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,960
all the random fluctuations that do the

1196
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,520
thermodynamic dissipation are averaged

1197
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,680
away and they start to behave like

1198
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,000
classical objects so you have this

1199
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,640
distinction between small things

1200
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,800
whose internal states and sensory states

1201
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
and active states could show lots of

1202
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
random fluctuations you know possibly

1203
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,200
even down to the quantum level

1204
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,760
versus big things like you and me

1205
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,160
that actually obey um

1206
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,280
almost

1207
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
lacrosse mechanics classical mechanics

1208
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,200
newton's laws of motion for example or

1209
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,280
electrodynamics in terms of the you know

1210
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,960
behavior of neural populations and the

1211
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,839
like

1212
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,040
so these classical dynamics are subject

1213
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,880
to exactly the same

1214
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,599
rules and principles that underwrite the

1215
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,359
free energy principle

1216
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,480
but in this special case

1217
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,240
all of the internal active and sensory

1218
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,839
paths

1219
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,240
dynamics are paths of least action

1220
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,480
because you've averaged away because

1221
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,680
you've coarse grained to an extent that

1222
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,160
there are no more random fluctuations

1223
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,000
and that creates a very different kind

1224
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
of behavior um

1225
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,079
that you know

1226
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,640
again moves us um into the realm of

1227
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,520
creatures that plan basically um simply

1228
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
because they have this precise kind of

1229
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,720
damage so

1230
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,000
in summary from the point of view of

1231
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
just the maths i think the taxonomy

1232
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,000
you're looking for which i don't think

1233
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,839
is actually out there yet but could be

1234
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,680
in in the fullness of time and i just

1235
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,040
said the reason i don't think it's quite

1236
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,000
out there

1237
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,760
is if you look at physics

1238
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,079
um up until now

1239
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,839
no one's really got beyond just saying

1240
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,920
there exists a heat bath or a scrutiny

1241
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,559
potential or a heat reservoir um so they

1242
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,359
haven't really thought about um a part

1243
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,880
you know the

1244
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,520
partition into a heat bath the thing

1245
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,119
that's contained by the heat mouth and

1246
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,960
the thing that contains the heat bath

1247
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
which is the external states so there

1248
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,640
isn't really a mechanics that really

1249
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,520
talks about thickness in this explicit

1250
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,559
uh

1251
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,359
way

1252
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,680
which is one reason i suspect there

1253
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,400
isn't actually at this stage of physics

1254
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,720
of different kinds of things but if that

1255
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,720
if there is my guess is it would be

1256
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,119
articulated in terms of the sparse

1257
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,280
coupling amongst partitions of a

1258
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,319
particular

1259
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,480
subsets of a particular petition

1260
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,599
and um whether or not

1261
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,240
certain subsets are or their dynamics

1262
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,480
are subject to um

1263
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,559
non-trivial random fluctuations and

1264
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,119
uncertainty

1265
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,839
awesome

1266
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,640
well fairly we all expect and prefer

1267
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,200
such a taxonomy so people can probably

1268
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,440
guess how that will influence our future

1269
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,200
policy selection

1270
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,760
it also takes us to a question that

1271
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,960
brock had raised uh in the week between

1272
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,640
the dot one of the dot two

1273
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,280
so brock asked i'm interested in how

1274
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,559
markov blankets interact and affect one

1275
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,720
another specifically when their scales

1276
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,520
differ by many orders of magnitude

1277
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,599
for example baseball versus the air

1278
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,240
molecules dna in a cell nucleus versus

1279
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,559
the environment alpha particles versus

1280
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,680
dna

1281
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,160
it sometimes seems the larger scale

1282
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,319
overwhelms the smaller scale and vice

1283
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,319
versa conditioned on some particular

1284
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,760
time skip

1285
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,680
i'm wondering if we're considering the

1286
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,640
markov blanket as its markov chain into

1287
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,880
the past and future if that relative

1288
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,280
scale is taken into account

1289
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,119
some things have shorter or longer

1290
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,200
markov chains that could possibly

1291
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,520
explain the seeming flip-flopping of

1292
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,599
direction of effects in their relative

1293
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,040
mass scales

1294
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,960
or is there some generalized synthesis

1295
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,319
of action

1296
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,760
free energy

1297
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,920
that considers both of these and others

1298
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,000
to explain the direction of effects

1299
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,559
so how do dynamically

1300
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,640
potentially dynamically changing

1301
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,160
boundaries

1302
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,040
and multi-scale systems come together to

1303
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,880
help us understand

1304
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,319
cascading

1305
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,800
top-down or bottom-up effects

1306
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,359
well done you should answer that from

1307
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,160
the point of view of evolution

1308
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,480
okay here would be one thought and and a

1309
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,079
a precursor non-fep perspective on this

1310
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,920
is synergetics

1311
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,599
the uh version of hermann haykin 1983

1312
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,559
classic citation multiscale systems like

1313
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,400
the ripple and the wave

1314
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,319
where is it that changing the ripple

1315
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,800
influences the wave and vice versa

1316
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,440
as well as synergetics which is a more

1317
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,520
geometric perspective that bucky fuller

1318
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,440
provides so people have been thinking

1319
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,000
about what kinds of top-down and

1320
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,599
bottom-up effects

1321
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,200
are

1322
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,920
causing cascading changes in multi-scale

1323
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,960
systems

1324
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,280
and then to bring it to evolution like

1325
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
you suggested

1326
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,119
the

1327
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,160
structure of the system so the system as

1328
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
received by the current moment

1329
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,839
sets up certain affordances

1330
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,119
for very similar stimuli to

1331
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,720
propagate through a system in a

1332
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,079
non-linear way so for example like

1333
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,040
a pheromone of a given shape

1334
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,079
might

1335
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,079
bind to a receptor with high affinity

1336
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,200
that opens local channels that makes

1337
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,200
that neuron fire and that amplifies and

1338
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
so that causes a change at the

1339
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,880
organismal behavior level

1340
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,800
because of the shape of that

1341
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,119
perturbation but then just adding one

1342
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,920
methyl group or modifying the chemical

1343
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,359
very slightly

1344
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,240
so a very similar stimuli or a photon of

1345
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,160
a wavelength outside of the receptive

1346
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,520
range of a given visual receptor doesn't

1347
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,119
induce that kind of a cascading change

1348
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,839
so

1349
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
perhaps it could just be said that the

1350
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,559
the structure of the system and maybe

1351
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,720
even the sparsity

1352
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,599
of the connection amongst subunits

1353
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,880
predisposes it in a given moment

1354
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,359
to have what appears to be

1355
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,760
almost exquisite sensitivity for certain

1356
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,200
kinds of changes

1357
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,400
while very similar changes next door

1358
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,880
may have very little effect

1359
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,400
and that potentially at a higher level

1360
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,760
evolution

1361
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
through the inter intra and

1362
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,400
inter-generational time scales

1363
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,240
gets to a multi-level

1364
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,599
position

1365
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,640
where

1366
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,559
the kinds of

1367
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,440
stimuli that one wouldn't want to have

1368
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,160
propagate through the system don't

1369
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,079
and the kinds of stimuli that one would

1370
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,520
want to have propagate through the

1371
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
system do

1372
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,520
because that multiscale system is the

1373
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
most responsive and adaptive over

1374
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,839
multiple time scales

1375
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,839
otherwise there might be something

1376
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,040
highly

1377
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,280
sensitive at one scale but it's at a

1378
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
blind alley at another time scale or

1379
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,880
vice versa

1380
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,599
yes to blue

1381
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,400
i instantly thought of evolution as soon

1382
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,359
as i heard that question um

1383
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,040
and really uh thinking about um where a

1384
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,400
situation where

1385
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,359
the particle of larger mass

1386
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,000
uh is overwhelmed by a particle of

1387
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
smaller mass i thought about this the

1388
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,960
sperm cell so like upon fertilization i

1389
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,440
think that the particle of smaller mass

1390
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,839
completely overwhelms the particle of of

1391
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,520
larger mass although

1392
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,359
the blanket of the the sperm cell i

1393
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,160
think is then subsumed into the

1394
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,760
the mother of the of a baby um but but i

1395
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,319
was reminded of the paper by matt sims

1396
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,800
that we discussed about counting

1397
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,720
biological minds

1398
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,839
and the interaction between vibrio

1399
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,400
fisheries and the squid

1400
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,040
when the the i mean the squid go in and

1401
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,000
out or the the vibrio fisher i go in and

1402
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,480
out of the squid in a very like um

1403
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,720
pretty it seems like very magical daily

1404
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,359
cycle and um

1405
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,520
compose the light organ or cause the

1406
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,480
squid to like light up and enable its

1407
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,680
hunting

1408
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,760
behavior or facilitate its hunting

1409
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,200
behavior because then it doesn't cast a

1410
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,119
shadow over the organisms that it's

1411
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,400
hunting

1412
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,720
and in this situation it's interesting

1413
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,960
it's these non-linear effects

1414
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,480
it's not one

1415
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
uh little bacteria that can make a squid

1416
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,920
light up but it's got to be like a

1417
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,319
sufficient concentration of bacteria

1418
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,319
that that cause the lighting up of of

1419
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,160
the squid

1420
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,160
and it's like a a compounded effect so

1421
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,200
um here like the the small markov

1422
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
blankets of each individual bacterial

1423
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,480
particle uh uh

1424
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,000
really um

1425
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,799
maybe overwhelm the larger system and i

1426
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,119
i don't know i i feel that way also

1427
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,839
about humans the microbiome and the work

1428
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,920
that we've um you know learned over the

1429
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,799
last

1430
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,280
20 years 10 years maybe

1431
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,200
about the microbiome and its importance

1432
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,680
in human behavior uh the gut brain

1433
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
access just overall

1434
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,640
human function functionality

1435
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,280
and toxicity and so forth so so i think

1436
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,359
that that all these small markov

1437
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
blankets really that have have

1438
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,760
a very important effect

1439
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,240
and non-linear but it does seem to take

1440
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,040
a

1441
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,960
quite a mass of them to make an impact

1442
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,280
can i just come in on the on the

1443
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,359
just to

1444
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,520
pick up on this um

1445
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,920
synchronization of

1446
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,640
large ensembles of uh similar kinds of

1447
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,000
markov blankets i think it's a very

1448
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,160
important notion it does strike me the

1449
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,160
sort of three fundamental issues buried

1450
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,319
in this question there's this sort of

1451
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,880
ensembles of markov blankets

1452
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,400
and then there's the

1453
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,280
link between different scales so mark

1454
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,559
off blankets of markov blankets um and

1455
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,160
then how does this manifest in terms of

1456
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,359
intuitive concepts like maths

1457
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,960
so

1458
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,440
just to rehearse what you're what's just

1459
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,640
been said

1460
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,720
from um

1461
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,160
distinguishing between ensembles of

1462
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,960
markov blankets at the same scale

1463
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,760
then you now have a mathematical image

1464
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,520
of um

1465
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,839
multicellular organization through to um

1466
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,160
eco niche construction through to cult

1467
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,760
you know cultural aspects of your

1468
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,640
evolutionary psychology in terms of lots

1469
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,040
of people interacting together and this

1470
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,760
has

1471
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,720
many many fascinating aspects

1472
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,079
the one

1473
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,359
if you like

1474
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,680
heuristic that i always keep referring

1475
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,599
to when

1476
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,839
trying to understand what

1477
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,119
a free energy-like principle would

1478
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,000
would bring you is that because the

1479
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
variation free energy is an extensive

1480
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,119
property

1481
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,799
it means that the

1482
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:00,079
free energy of the ensemble of a

1483
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,480
collection of multiple markov blankets

1484
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,720
all talking to each other or coupled to

1485
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,680
each other via their uh blanket states

1486
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,640
um

1487
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,559
is the the can be cast as the sum of

1488
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,799
each individual uh free energy and if

1489
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,960
you just um

1490
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,799
simplify the notion of free energy as

1491
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,720
predictability what you're saying is

1492
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,680
that the

1493
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,480
um

1494
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,440
the

1495
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,720
um

1496
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,079
likely state of an ensemble is that in

1497
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,000
which they've jointly minimized their

1498
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,240
free energy by making everything

1499
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
mutually predictable and this normally

1500
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,799
um is manifest

1501
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,280
as generalized synchronization which is

1502
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
exactly the sort of you know the

1503
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,240
the the behavior of um bugs

1504
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,200
that

1505
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,160
light up in together or birds that flock

1506
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,599
together

1507
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,599
so you you see this and you could

1508
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,440
actually argue that sort of things like

1509
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
language

1510
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,119
are just one

1511
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,960
um expression

1512
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,480
of a way

1513
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,880
to ensure that we're all mutually

1514
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,280
predictable and ensuring that we are

1515
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,599
jointly mutually predictable means that

1516
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,280
jointly we can minimize our free energy

1517
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,079
so there's lots of really interesting uh

1518
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,480
sort of directions that you can take

1519
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,319
that notion of what would happen if you

1520
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,520
put lots of uh markov blankets together

1521
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,839
the other the second thing which i think

1522
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,520
um you know speaks more to the

1523
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,960
evolutionary thing

1524
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,079
is the the link between blankets of

1525
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,079
blankets at different scales and you

1526
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,079
know we

1527
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,319
we've just heard in the previous answers

1528
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,200
that this normally entails not only a

1529
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,720
coarse graining

1530
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,319
um moving if you like up in terms of the

1531
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,640
spatial scale but absolutely crucially a

1532
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,040
temporal scale and i think that that's

1533
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,079
absolutely crucial the fact that um

1534
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,280
the um

1535
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,240
the markov blanket at a lower scale

1536
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,520
is likely to less to last for a shorter

1537
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,000
amount of time than the markov blanket

1538
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,160
at the bigger scale so it's perfectly

1539
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,760
permissible to apply the free energy

1540
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,760
principle to mark off blankets that

1541
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,160
exist for a short period of time from

1542
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,040
the point of view of a larger scale

1543
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,680
and allow for a metamorphosis of face

1544
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,160
transition emerging a mark off blankets

1545
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,000
with the other sperm and the egg cell

1546
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,520
but from the point of view of the scale

1547
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,880
above this is perfectly permissible um

1548
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,480
so the free energy principle only

1549
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,280
applies at the time scale

1550
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,000
that is associated with the level in

1551
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,640
question but now the game is to

1552
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,400
understand how

1553
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,559
the markov blanket of markov blankets at

1554
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,559
the scale above

1555
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,480
couples to the scope below and vice

1556
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480
versa and this brings us to all sorts of

1557
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,359
delicate issues about um

1558
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,079
you know how you would read evolution

1559
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,640
and epigenetics as

1560
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,280
prescribing short-lived markov blankets

1561
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,680
in phenotypic time for example

1562
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,480
it also again speaks to

1563
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,040
this fundamental role of the separation

1564
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,200
of time scales that daniel was talking

1565
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,280
about in relation to synergistics you

1566
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,720
know fast and slow modes um so i think

1567
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
that that kind of um

1568
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,799
thinking about things from different um

1569
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,040
different point of view of a separation

1570
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,920
of

1571
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,520
um temporal or spatial temporal scales

1572
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,359
begs some deep questions about top-down

1573
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,400
and bottom-up causation that is um

1574
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,640
if you like can be articulated in terms

1575
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,520
of the endurance of markov blankets at

1576
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,760
any particular scale finally the mass

1577
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,359
thing is interesting

1578
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,119
it relates very much to

1579
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,799
the scale

1580
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,240
so mass at a quantum level is usually

1581
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,880
read as the inverse amplitude of random

1582
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,319
fluctuations

1583
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,640
um so if you're looking for the sort of

1584
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,839
you know the intuitive notion of mass uh

1585
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,920
as dictating the behavior of a very

1586
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,799
small particle at the quantum scale

1587
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,040
then the you know the quantity that

1588
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,680
underwrites that is the amplitude of the

1589
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,240
um of the random fluctuation so as

1590
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,079
things get hotter

1591
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,319
with more and more random fluctuations

1592
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,000
they tend to have they look as if they

1593
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,599
have smaller mass

1594
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,040
but as you get bigger and bigger and

1595
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,400
bigger and you move into the world of

1596
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,160
lagrangian mechanics and classical

1597
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,559
mechanics and the random fluctuations

1598
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,920
disappear

1599
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,480
then you're in the world now where mass

1600
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,599
takes on a very different meaning and it

1601
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,400
effectively can be regarded as a an

1602
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
active state in the sense that my mass

1603
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,520
attracts you so i act on you through my

1604
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,359
mass attracting you

1605
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,599
and then you're in the world of general

1606
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,119
relativity uh end body problems um and i

1607
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,240
mentioned in body problems because they

1608
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,280
the only thing that makes them

1609
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,040
interesting is exactly the

1610
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,799
non-linearities that blue was talking

1611
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,280
about uh so you know if you didn't have

1612
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,119
those nonlinearities and there's

1613
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,520
solenoidal flows that underwrite

1614
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,000
lagrangian mechanics um

1615
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,760
the orbiting of the heavenly bodies or

1616
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,520
anything that oscillates you know in a

1617
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,640
classical sense and then then you would

1618
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,680
not have

1619
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,440
the itinerant dynamics that the

1620
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,440
characteristic of non-equilibrium

1621
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,720
systems that that conform to classic

1622
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,240
classical mechanics

1623
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,119
so

1624
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,799
just the notion of mass i think is

1625
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,119
itself really very interesting and takes

1626
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,640
on very very different meanings

1627
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,480
mathematically depending upon whether

1628
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,400
you're working a very very small scale

1629
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,839
or a very large scale

1630
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,880
this is kind of a call back to our

1631
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,400
previous discussion

1632
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,440
we talked about three generalizations

1633
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,480
we talked about generalized synchrony

1634
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,559
generalized coordinates of motions and

1635
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,640
generalized homeostasis

1636
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,079
and so i'm actually seeing these

1637
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,960
reflected in your response and in your

1638
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,799
trilemma carl um the ensembles of markov

1639
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,520
blankets at the same scale of similar or

1640
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,520
different kinds of things

1641
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,839
is a general synchronization and again

1642
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,079
that doesn't mean lockstep that means it

1643
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,240
could be turn taking as a generalized

1644
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
mode to

1645
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,280
allow for this mutual predictability and

1646
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,440
that's generalized synchronization

1647
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,920
and then the second point had to do with

1648
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,880
the relationship between scales whether

1649
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,160
that's accomplished with a

1650
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,400
renormalization or with some other

1651
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,799
framework from synergetics and that made

1652
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,240
me think about the generalized

1653
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,640
coordinates in space and time

1654
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,760
and kind of like a gps coordinate

1655
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,720
not exactly but it's like scales of 10

1656
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,799
in space and so there's some coordinate

1657
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,960
systems that help us navigate

1658
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,280
multi-scale spatial and temporal

1659
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,119
with um this

1660
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,559
notion that things that are things for

1661
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,319
shorter amounts of time tend to be

1662
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,440
smaller

1663
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,760
and even things that have large spatial

1664
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,559
extent and are short-lived

1665
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,400
the smaller parts of them are even more

1666
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,799
short-lived so it's kind of true within

1667
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,720
and between different kinds of things

1668
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,039
and then this final one

1669
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,799
i feel like should connect to

1670
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,880
generalized homeostasis i was thinking

1671
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,400
about the orbiting

1672
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,319
of the planets

1673
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,760
as a generalized homeostasis

1674
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,200
in some way like the non-linearity

1675
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,760
is such that it isn't just

1676
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,079
collisions and repulsions

1677
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,720
but actually there is an attracting set

1678
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,359
and there's biorhythms

1679
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,480
that are

1680
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,319
predicated upon the generalized

1681
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:29,760
synchronization

1682
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,680
and the generalized coordinates somehow

1683
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,319
and that allows for multi-scale

1684
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,960
generalized homeostasis which is to say

1685
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,640
persistent multi-scale things

1686
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,079
let's go to a slightly different and

1687
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,079
technical question

1688
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,280
this is from

1689
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,720
ml don

1690
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,039
who wrote

1691
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,079
say in our generative model we have n

1692
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,200
numbers of possible states s

1693
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,599
given observation o we would like to

1694
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,039
estimate

1695
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,240
p s

1696
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,799
conditioned upon o equals o using

1697
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,559
variational inference

1698
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,359
what if we needed the n plus first state

1699
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,559
variable

1700
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,039
in order to describe the true posterior

1701
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,000
better

1702
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,240
similar to thinking out of the box by

1703
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,000
adding dimensions

1704
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,680
so partially observable states would

1705
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,760
mean two things

1706
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,720
one i don't know how many states i need

1707
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,640
so i need to be flexible in thinking out

1708
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,440
of the box for better estimation of p s

1709
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,200
conditioned on o

1710
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,880
and two given observation o i am not

1711
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,359
certain what state i am in

1712
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,359
could you please discuss the idea of

1713
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:45,039
flexible growing and pruning of states s

1714
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,400
while estimating the true posterior

1715
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,200
so this is a question that's come up

1716
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,520
occasionally over the last few years

1717
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,880
and i i remember ryan smith did some

1718
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
work on exactly this

1719
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,839
question

1720
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,640
specifically on how you might grow

1721
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,960
the states in your model

1722
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,039
um

1723
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,799
so

1724
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,480
i think it's still an open question as

1725
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,880
to what the optimal way of adding in new

1726
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,880
states or new hypotheses is

1727
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,280
but i think the way of evaluating

1728
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,440
whether those additional hypotheses are

1729
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,520
useful is is much better established

1730
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,760
so beyond the answer to the the second

1731
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,280
part how do you evaluate whether it's

1732
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,119
useful to have an additional state or

1733
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,760
hypothesis as part of your model or not

1734
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,200
is

1735
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,440
simply to to perform a basin model

1736
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,960
comparison so

1737
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,119
you calculate the marginal likelihood or

1738
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,520
a free energy approximation to that

1739
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,280
when the state is in play and then

1740
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
another one when it's not

1741
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,680
um it's interesting to to note that the

1742
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,160
question highlights both growing and i

1743
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,119
think pruning was in there as well um

1744
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,920
and that

1745
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,319
it's interesting it's much easier to

1746
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,000
prune them away

1747
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
than it is to work out how to add in new

1748
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,119
states

1749
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,160
um

1750
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,000
and we can do that very efficiently

1751
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,440
using methods like bayes and model

1752
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,640
reduction

1753
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,480
which effectively say let's let's sort

1754
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,839
of run the model

1755
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,480
uh or fit our model

1756
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,400
when we've got all of our hypotheses in

1757
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,000
play

1758
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,599
and then test

1759
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,720
post hoc alternative models

1760
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,960
in which we've set the prior probability

1761
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,039
of certain states to zero or to nearly

1762
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,039
zero to compare how much better would

1763
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,039
our model be without it

1764
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,039
and it's better in the sense that we

1765
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,440
managed to reduce the complexity of the

1766
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,319
model we're using we simplify things and

1767
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,119
comply with occam's razor while

1768
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,119
maintaining a high degree of accuracy in

1769
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,359
how we predict the data

1770
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,119
which are the accuracy and complexity

1771
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,319
terms that we get in a marginal

1772
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,440
likelihood or free energy

1773
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,960
so

1774
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,640
if we had a simple way of adding in

1775
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,440
additional states

1776
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,359
um then

1777
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,960
then it's just simply a matter of then

1778
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,880
calculating with that additional state

1779
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,119
is the marginal likelihood improved or

1780
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,480
not

1781
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:14,800
um

1782
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,080
[Music]

1783
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,679
an alternative way is to say well no

1784
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,960
actually let's just take the pruning

1785
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
perspective let's just start from a very

1786
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,960
large number of states and an over

1787
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,120
parameterized generated model of our

1788
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,439
world with many hypotheses

1789
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,120
that we don't possibly think are ever

1790
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,439
going to really be there and then simply

1791
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,880
prune them away

1792
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,319
in relation to the data we have until

1793
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,158
we've got the simplest accurate

1794
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,839
explanation for those data

1795
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,359
it's very interesting about um after

1796
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,679
a proposal is on the table

1797
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,839
whether we're in the bayesian

1798
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,839
or we're in the frequentist world

1799
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,719
evaluating alternatives can be done with

1800
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,279
a defined

1801
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,479
approach but it is how you get the

1802
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,479
proposal onto the table

1803
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,719
what generates new alternatives because

1804
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,839
the space of model

1805
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,839
modifications may be like

1806
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,920
pragmatically or even in principle

1807
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,158
open-ended especially if we allow for

1808
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:13,759
very complex

1809
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,759
structural maneuvers

1810
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,960
like nesting of models

1811
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,679
that is basically open-ended in which

1812
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,439
proposals are possible

1813
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,960
however those may be modeled as actions

1814
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,080
of some

1815
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,600
model builder

1816
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,520
and then they have certain affordances i

1817
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,799
can add nodes remove nodes connect add a

1818
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,799
connection remove a connection or

1819
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,759
perform these structural modifications

1820
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,120
and then it could be something like a

1821
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,238
genetic algorithm or some other policy

1822
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,359
selection

1823
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,439
approach that results in the space being

1824
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,679
heuristically or adaptively explored in

1825
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,759
terms of model structures

1826
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,080
but it's never going to be as defined of

1827
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,600
a question as

1828
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,800
comparing

1829
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,280
alternatives because that has um a very

1830
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,480
specific

1831
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,239
kind of

1832
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,960
plug and chug basis

1833
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,400
unlike the creativity and the

1834
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,239
open-endedness associated with making

1835
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,880
model changes

1836
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,280
yes and the point you make about

1837
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,880
finding a way of

1838
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,280
a set of operations to build a model is

1839
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,960
an interesting one as well and instead

1840
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,960
we had some discussions with giovanni

1841
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,360
pizzulo as well not not long ago

1842
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,840
and thinking about exactly what sort of

1843
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,600
operations those might be

1844
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,199
whether it be duplicating parts of a

1845
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,440
model adding in hierarchical levels or

1846
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,520
taking them away adding in states taking

1847
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,520
them away

1848
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,440
and and

1849
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,960
and how that might

1850
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,040
manifest in terms of natural selection

1851
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,360
of models over and development of

1852
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,280
cognitive architectures over

1853
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,760
um evolutionary time

1854
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,960
cool we did discuss uh at least one

1855
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,280
paper of pizzulo at all

1856
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,120
that was talking about the simple

1857
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,440
homeostatic architecture and how that

1858
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,360
could be um

1859
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,880
turned into a more anticipatory

1860
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,120
structure and so on

1861
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,320
um

1862
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,199
let's

1863
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,040
turn back to

1864
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,040
the roadmap

1865
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,520
daniel before we go i just mentioned

1866
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,400
there's three things which people um

1867
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,719
might have heard about which would be uh

1868
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,080
sort of use related to what you just

1869
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,920
been discussing the first thing is

1870
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,600
structure learning in radical

1871
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,199
constructivism so the work of people

1872
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,840
like josh tenenbaum and how to grow a

1873
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,640
mind i think was his title of one of his

1874
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,239
popular

1875
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,640
papers so this is exactly the same

1876
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,480
problem you've been discussing what are

1877
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,320
the rules and principles for growing

1878
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,080
morals and learning the structure of a

1879
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,719
model that could include and you know an

1880
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,640
n plus one state so that's a very

1881
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,640
interesting literature um the other um

1882
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,600
probably more technical um

1883
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,320
take on this is called non-parametric

1884
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,600
bays

1885
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,760
where there are priors

1886
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,719
um

1887
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,000
um used to decide whether to include or

1888
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,800
not state n plus one given you are

1889
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,320
currently using just states one to n and

1890
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,480
they rest upon things called stick

1891
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
breaking processes like the chinese

1892
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,000
restaurant process

1893
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,159
so there is a quite a literature out

1894
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,640
there in terms of

1895
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,679
structuring the growth of a model

1896
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,120
usually i repeat usually under the

1897
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,320
rubric of

1898
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,239
non-parametric base

1899
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,400
and then finally

1900
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,960
in economics

1901
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,840
there is a

1902
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,880
an ideology that rests upon

1903
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,800
this distinction between

1904
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,239
not knowing

1905
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,880
having uncertainty

1906
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,280
about states of the world

1907
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,480
and having uncertainty about states that

1908
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,760
have never been encountered or

1909
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,679
represented before and that's sometimes

1910
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,080
referred to as radical uncertainty so

1911
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,800
which is meant to distinguish just

1912
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
between just being uncertain about

1913
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,600
states of affairs to be

1914
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,199
knowing that i just don't even know

1915
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,520
these states could ever happen um

1916
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,480
so

1917
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,000
interestingly radical uncertainty is

1918
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,400
usually used as a motivation for not

1919
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,159
committing to a

1920
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,000
probabilistic or bayesian

1921
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,480
description of things so you move into

1922
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,199
sort of heuristics of the gerd gigaren's

1923
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,600
sword and narrative explanations for

1924
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,560
things

1925
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,440
but i think if you you know if you

1926
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,480
cast radical uncertainty as exactly the

1927
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,760
kind of problem that you've been trying

1928
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,440
to think about principle solutions for

1929
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,719
you can probably bring that kind of um

1930
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,360
economic perspective back into um

1931
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,760
into formal maths uh just one final

1932
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,239
point and this relating to the previous

1933
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,600
question uh about um ensembles and the

1934
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,679
conclusion that we all try to make our

1935
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,400
worlds as predictable as possible that

1936
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,480
sort of suggests you don't need to grow

1937
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,480
morals very much

1938
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,560
if there is a case that we construct our

1939
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,840
own universes in a way to make them

1940
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,199
predictable then we actually don't need

1941
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,640
very complex uh models so i i wonder

1942
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,560
whether in fact the shrinking or the

1943
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,400
bayesian model reduction

1944
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,560
is perfectly fit for purpose and

1945
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,719
certainly it's consistent with them with

1946
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,880
me in the sense that i was born with too

1947
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,960
many neurons and too many connections

1948
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,280
and as i get older i just lose stuff but

1949
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,920
at least i become more fit for purpose

1950
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,760
modeling my little world which you all

1951
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,679
carefully keep very predictable for me

1952
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:26,840
and thank

1953
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,880
you um i'll connect that

1954
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,760
to uh one uh

1955
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,560
common casual framework but in a recent

1956
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,280
paper with scott david and rj corday we

1957
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,800
we connected rumsfeld's quadrant the uh

1958
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,280
unknown known known unknown

1959
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,000
and interestingly in that famous quote

1960
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,800
by rumsfeld if um people look at it

1961
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,480
there's he only mentions three of the

1962
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,840
quadrants

1963
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,640
and the unknown known

1964
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,360
is actually like a hidden quadrant

1965
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,000
and we sort of in a preliminary way

1966
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,440
asked what do these different situations

1967
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,280
mean for different knowledge about

1968
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,000
particular states so no known includes

1969
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,640
the metacognitive aspect of knowing

1970
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,280
not only all the partitioned states but

1971
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,360
also the policy

1972
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,920
and then in the unknown known the

1973
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,719
partitions are known but what is unknown

1974
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,120
is actually the policy you got the atom

1975
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,280
level description of the car but you

1976
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,440
still might not know what policy to take

1977
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,520
in terms of using the card

1978
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,199
and then knowing unknown is basically

1979
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,760
the bounded rationality bounded at the

1980
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,920
perimeter of the particulate entity

1981
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,640
because the internal and blanket states

1982
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,480
are known as well as potentially even

1983
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,920
what to do

1984
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,840
but the external state has high

1985
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,560
uncertainty and then this unknown

1986
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,480
unknown which is that radical

1987
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,960
uncertainty might include like not

1988
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,800
knowing what's out there or how to

1989
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,719
pursue it and there might be different

1990
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,679
mappings too but um that was just

1991
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,080
coming to mind with this question about

1992
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,600
uncertainty about states of the world

1993
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,960
and then uncertainty of states that

1994
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,239
haven't been observed before

1995
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,560
let's return to the roadmap

1996
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,640
on our road trip

1997
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,960
and um is there a section

1998
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,520
that somebody feels like

1999
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,880
plays

2000
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,600
well here or section that we haven't

2001
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,520
been able to

2002
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,080
cover any of the figures or formalisms

2003
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,080
of

2004
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,320
so i don't think we've covered any of

2005
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,199
the

2006
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,840
figures except for figure one maybe we

2007
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,679
want to look into the

2008
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,760
figure two autonomous flow manifold flow

2009
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,640
great so yes we did spend um a lot of

2010
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,640
time talking about the particular

2011
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,080
partition

2012
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,840
in this discussion and in many other

2013
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,760
discussions and it's really important

2014
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,280
it's the

2015
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
particular physics but it would be

2016
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,560
awesome to

2017
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,880
just spend a few minutes on each of the

2018
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,719
subsequent figures

2019
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,640
what is being shown

2020
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,960
what do the axes or formalisms represent

2021
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,320
and what are the implications of the

2022
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,360
figure

2023
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,880
so here we have figure two or carl or

2024
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,520
thomas what is being shown in figure 2

2025
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,080
i suppose there are there are a couple

2026
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,040
of things being shown in figure two

2027
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,080
um

2028
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,199
i think the the graphic on the left

2029
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,000
um

2030
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,320
with the spiral is

2031
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,400
quite a nice way of demonstrating this

2032
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,840
idea of

2033
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,560
there being some um solenoidal element

2034
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,000
to the flow

2035
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,600
which is causing it to

2036
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,199
sort of have this circular structure

2037
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,719
um

2038
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,640
that then

2039
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
as a consequence of having the

2040
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,040
the um

2041
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,880
the dissipative part of the flow with

2042
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,560
this these gamma terms the difference

2043
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
between the cubing the solenoid and the

2044
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,199
gamma being the um

2045
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,719
the dissipative part of this flow and

2046
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,679
that that then reduces the amplitude of

2047
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,520
this spiral over time and you end up

2048
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,840
with this settling to some point

2049
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,440
um

2050
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,280
so

2051
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,960
it's just setting out the the two

2052
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,800
different directions really that things

2053
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,400
can evolve it

2054
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,440
um

2055
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,480
and

2056
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,920
i'm trying to remember exactly what the

2057
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,360
equations were in the paper that led to

2058
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,080
the the expression in terms of the um

2059
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,880
the alpha and the bold alpha

2060
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,719
um can't they remember that better um

2061
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,440
is it called was this a least action

2062
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,040
path that we were talking about here in

2063
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,880
terms of the bold alpha is this the

2064
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,560
settling to the least action

2065
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,000
yeah yeah and

2066
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,120
um

2067
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,880
it's

2068
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,719
an analysis which people might come

2069
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,159
across when they look at things like the

2070
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,320
center manifold theorem or indeed the

2071
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,880
slaving principle that um

2072
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,159
daniel was just talking about from

2073
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,760
synergetics you've got these sort of

2074
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,560
fast fluctuations that are drawn to a

2075
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,199
center manifold in our case the center

2076
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,040
manifold or the manifold that sort of

2077
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,360
draws trajectories to it are the paths

2078
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,120
of least action

2079
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,000
that

2080
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,159
constitute in the joint space of the

2081
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,520
external and

2082
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,679
internal autonomous states that

2083
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,520
synchronization manifold but in this

2084
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,560
instance

2085
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,560
not synchronization between people but

2086
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,320
synchronization between the inside and

2087
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,960
the outside

2088
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,480
three and how about the right side

2089
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,280
sorry i meant the dark line on the right

2090
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,880
hand side

2091
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,239
was meant to be the uh the

2092
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,880
synchronization manifold to which um

2093
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,600
to which your all trajectories are drawn

2094
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,640
and

2095
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,199
largely lie upon that synchronization

2096
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:09,520
manifold and any perturbations um um

2097
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,520
sort of collapse back to or drawn back

2098
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,840
to that manifold in the spirit of the

2099
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,120
left-hand side of the diagram so um

2100
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,760
so using words like manifold is to

2101
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,320
emphasize this is very much related to

2102
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,880
the center manifold theorem it also

2103
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,600
speaks to one way of describing

2104
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,840
generalized synchronization of chaos or

2105
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,560
generalized synchrony which is collapse2

2106
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,840
or constraint constrained flows on a

2107
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,080
synchronization manifold

2108
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,760
so this is just your one way of

2109
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,360
graphically illustrating um

2110
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,159
awesome

2111
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,199
any other

2112
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:52,000
thoughts on too

2113
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,679
where's the uh housekeeping term

2114
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,120
the lambda

2115
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,719
because there's the q

2116
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,440
and the gamma but as we've discussed in

2117
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,679
live stream 32

2118
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,120
there's another term there too

2119
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,239
so i think that the q and the gamma here

2120
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,159
are sort of implicitly

2121
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,639
being treated as constants so they're

2122
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,800
not varying over state space in in this

2123
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
particular graphic

2124
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,040
uh and so the housekeeping term will

2125
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,120
only will only appear whether it's some

2126
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,800
variation depending upon where you are

2127
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,770
in state space

2128
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,719
[Music]

2129
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,960
in principle you've put it back there

2130
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,880
um by allowing those slightly more

2131
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,080
complicated

2132
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,880
trajectories um with

2133
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
more interesting solenoidal flows i

2134
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,560
think normally we tend to just assume

2135
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,880
that the the space is defined such that

2136
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,040
the gamma term can be treated as

2137
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,520
effectively a diagonal or an even an

2138
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,760
identity matrix or at least a block

2139
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,600
diagonal type matrix

2140
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,040
that gets a little bit more complicated

2141
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,480
when working in generalized coordinates

2142
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,920
of motion because of the structure that

2143
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,320
the blocks have to account for

2144
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,480
the correlations between

2145
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,600
uh different orders of motion but

2146
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,760
but doesn't necessarily have to vary

2147
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,800
depending on where you are in space

2148
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,480
awesome

2149
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,239
you go

2150
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,320
you should feel licensed to ignore the

2151
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,280
housekeeping term in most

2152
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,120
people it gets too complicated

2153
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,360
okay on to

2154
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,480
three

2155
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,239
so three

2156
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,320
was labeled as markov blankets and

2157
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,480
self-evidencing

2158
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,239
what is being shown in three

2159
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,719
uh well i'll i'll do this briefly then

2160
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,800
then one of you could take over it it

2161
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,920
was just um

2162
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,719
this slide is usually um

2163
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,320
used to

2164
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,880
illustrate that um

2165
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,280
the the free energy formalism or

2166
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,320
understanding dynamics as gradient flows

2167
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,040
on a an energy functional

2168
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,560
is unremarkable in the sense that it has

2169
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,280
a lot of construct validity in relation

2170
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,159
to

2171
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,320
existing and

2172
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,480
legacy formulations

2173
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,040
of behavior usually of a normative kind

2174
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,320
and by normative i just mean that

2175
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,400
there's some objective function that is

2176
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,360
being um extremized so it's just meant

2177
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,159
to to illustrate that um

2178
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,520
the the

2179
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,120
this um

2180
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,480
physics-like formulation in terms of um

2181
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,920
dynamics

2182
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,760
and gradient flows on this free energy

2183
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,760
functional um looks and is in a position

2184
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,800
to formalize lots of existing theories

2185
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,239
and constructs such as reinforcement

2186
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,800
learning natural control theory provided

2187
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,800
you now read um the objective function

2188
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,760
as a log preference well

2189
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,000
the log of your prior

2190
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,360
prior preferred states uh and you know

2191
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,960
i'm just showing that taking different

2192
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,880
perspectives on um normative accounts of

2193
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,400
uh behavior

2194
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,440
um

2195
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,239
is

2196
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:13,600
very uh they're all formally uh

2197
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,199
very very related um in the sense for

2198
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,000
example that the negative of value so

2199
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,280
defined

2200
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,199
becomes self-information

2201
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,840
if you're you're sort of if you were not

2202
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,239
an economist and you were an information

2203
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,000
theorist you would read the same

2204
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,080
quantity basically a self-informational

2205
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,400
surprise or surprise and you you

2206
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,080
wouldn't talk about expert utility

2207
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,320
theory you talk about maximum efficiency

2208
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,880
and information theoretic sense

2209
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,960
if you were somebody like him and haken

2210
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,960
and thinking about synergetics you'd be

2211
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,080
taking the average of the

2212
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,480
self-informational surprise and then

2213
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,040
these dynamics would be basically the

2214
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,880
thing you are aspiring to understand and

2215
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,239
describe from the point of view of

2216
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,639
synergetics and if you're a physiologist

2217
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,040
uh homeostasis and of course if you're a

2218
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,760
statistician or somebody like us um

2219
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,000
who's interested in the uh

2220
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,480
if you like the pure probability theory

2221
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,440
um

2222
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,520
then you can interpret

2223
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,760
the uh these gradient flows as

2224
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,360
articulating um or at least describing

2225
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,360
things like the basic brain hypothesis

2226
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,880
so it was just an attempt to show that

2227
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,280
there is just one simple dynamic under

2228
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,239
the hood of all of these well-accepted

2229
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,639
well-proven um

2230
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,400
accounts of

2231
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,280
normative behavior

2232
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,239
why is free energy principle

2233
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:41,839
in the blue cell

2234
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,960
um i i think just because

2235
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,400
it could be described as a a a principle

2236
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,080
articulated in terms of information

2237
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,560
theory um where information theory is

2238
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,960
just a probability theory with some

2239
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,040
geometry

2240
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,320
okay and while we're on this question of

2241
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,120
unification

2242
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,360
what does the cover of the active

2243
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,320
inference textbook

2244
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,440
i'm curious to hear what you think

2245
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,400
tradition dictates that blue go first

2246
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,800
isn't it like the one ring to bind them

2247
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,880
the one ring to find them and the one

2248
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,159
ring to rule them all or like that that

2249
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,800
um no really i i've given a

2250
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,480
really um

2251
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
it's like the lord of the rings

2252
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,280
um reference except like instead of the

2253
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,639
inscription

2254
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:43,520
there's math

2255
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,600
[Laughter]

2256
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,440
uh anyway

2257
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,199
there's there's the funny

2258
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,839
take

2259
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,400
of of the things i see

2260
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,639
before we hear um two thirds of the

2261
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,120
answer um yes there's the lord of the

2262
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,480
rings reference and also it's a a

2263
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,600
blanket

2264
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,840
and it's a particle and it that's the

2265
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,480
equations that are about partitioning

2266
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,560
internal from external states

2267
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,840
and so the

2268
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,040
with a minimal amount of text

2269
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,880
and the minimal number of threes

2270
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,120
presented mind brain and behavior par

2271
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,880
pizzulo and fristen

2272
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,639
there is the partition

2273
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,520
column in two minds as to whether we we

2274
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,560
tell them

2275
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,760
i thought it feel like it's more

2276
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,120
interesting having these different

2277
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,800
interpretations

2278
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,159
yeah

2279
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,520
okay

2280
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,120
i won't push it let's go to figure four

2281
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,320
well no just to say that

2282
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:52,080
that's very clever

2283
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,920
also you know we didn't realize how

2284
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,000
clever um i think this is thomas and

2285
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,040
giovanni came up with this uh but um

2286
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,800
completing the ring with an extra equal

2287
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,719
sign was quite an insight for me at some

2288
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,719
point can you remember that thomas was

2289
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,639
that was that you or bob who suddenly

2290
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,480
spotted the uh the idea of making

2291
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,159
everything equal in a

2292
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,639
true causality

2293
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,560
yeah and

2294
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,080
i think it was giovanni had she raised

2295
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,540
the equal sign

2296
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,280
[Music]

2297
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,520
now but now we have three other ways of

2298
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,440
selling this very clever uh clever

2299
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,440
little icon yes i wish we thought

2300
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,800
okay in figure four

2301
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,400
it's describing generic and precise

2302
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,920
particles

2303
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,360
so what are being shown here

2304
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,600
um i'll take this one because uh

2305
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,880
i did this one um so this is exactly the

2306
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,239
um

2307
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,159
trying to depict the distinction we were

2308
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,920
talking about before when we asked you

2309
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,920
about a taxonomy of different kinds of

2310
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,600
things and i was just saying

2311
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
it's useful to make a distinction

2312
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,719
between very small quantum scale things

2313
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,760
and large classical scale things where

2314
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,679
the particles are sufficiently large

2315
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,560
that the um the random fluctuations go

2316
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,320
away and every

2317
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,560
or a particular path

2318
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,520
is a path of least action and in this uh

2319
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,199
specific case

2320
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,520
there are certain um

2321
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,760
sources of uncertainty that disappear

2322
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,159
that manifest as a collapse of

2323
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:31,440
certain uncertainties and

2324
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,159
that can be captured

2325
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,520
using what's called an information

2326
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,040
diagram so this is an information

2327
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,360
diagram and it's basically you can

2328
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,719
understand

2329
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,719
the areas

2330
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,800
as uncertainty or entropy

2331
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,320
and the

2332
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,480
left hand set of panels is in the

2333
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,360
general case that would be suitable for

2334
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:53,910
um

2335
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,040
[Music]

2336
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,760
very small particles

2337
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,320
showing the shared and unique

2338
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,840
information

2339
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,320
between the

2340
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,440
between a partition into external

2341
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,800
sensory and um for simplicity autonomous

2342
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,040
states here uh and the areas of

2343
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,199
intersection can be read as a mutual

2344
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,480
information

2345
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,600
um

2346
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,719
so

2347
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,480
what you can see on

2348
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,880
on the right hand side the left-hand

2349
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,000
side

2350
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,960
um

2351
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,520
is that there is uncertainty

2352
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,040
still in the game

2353
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,920
even when i have i know everything else

2354
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,840
so there is a unique uncertainty

2355
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,760
associated with

2356
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,880
um

2357
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,719
every one of the states

2358
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,040
but if i now move to precise particles

2359
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,040
or particles that behave as if they were

2360
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,600
more classical in nature

2361
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,239
there are um

2362
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,080
a lot of uncertainty disappears in the

2363
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,400
sense that the only source of random

2364
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,040
fluctuations is on the at the paths or

2365
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,000
the dynamics of the external states

2366
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,679
which means that if i um knew

2367
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,600
the um

2368
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,840
external and autonomous states then i

2369
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,159
would be able to predict precisely the

2370
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,719
paths of least action or the paths that

2371
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,040
uh a sensory state would take in the

2372
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,560
absence of any um random fluctuations so

2373
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,320
the unique uncertainty associated with

2374
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,280
the sensory states s disappears um

2375
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,239
similarly um if i knew the external

2376
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:27,679
states and the sensory states um then

2377
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,760
there is no uncertainty about the path

2378
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,400
of autonomous states so the unique pink

2379
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,800
part associated with alpha the

2380
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,960
autonomous states disappears

2381
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,719
and that has the interest interesting

2382
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,000
implication

2383
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,920
that the uncertainty

2384
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,880
about the both the sensory and

2385
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,560
active uh st

2386
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,600
autonomous states has to be the same

2387
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,400
if

2388
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,840
the um if you knew the external states

2389
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,880
um here denoted by eta and and other

2390
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,760
things so for example um there is no

2391
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,080
uncertainty about active states given

2392
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,080
sensory states which means that the

2393
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,080
active states on the right hand side

2394
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,320
have to lie within the sensory states

2395
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,239
and you may be asking well why is this

2396
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,679
useful

2397
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:15,440
well it becomes incredibly useful

2398
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,120
when you apply those constraints those

2399
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,440
um

2400
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,920
things like the uncertainty about

2401
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,600
both

2402
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,760
autonomous and sensory states given

2403
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,760
external states have to be the same for

2404
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,880
example and that there is no uncertain

2405
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,800
the uncertainty about external states

2406
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,560
given sensory states

2407
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,199
is the same as the uncertainty of uh

2408
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,280
external states given both sensory and

2409
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,440
autonomous states for example all of

2410
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,880
these little sort of if you like

2411
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,960
constraints that ensue

2412
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,159
from the simple move from big from small

2413
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,360
to big particles get into

2414
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,159
um

2415
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,520
an expression for the probability

2416
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,639
distribution over autonomous paths and

2417
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,840
it is this these set of constraints

2418
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,719
that lead to

2419
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:09,440
a

2420
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,199
functional form

2421
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,440
for the expected free energy

2422
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,760
which can be decomposed into what we

2423
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,120
were talking about before which is

2424
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,159
expected information gain and the

2425
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,800
expected cost in the absence of those

2426
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,800
constraints that expected information

2427
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,719
game would disappear they would it would

2428
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,560
all come it would the things would

2429
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,679
cancel out in the general case so this

2430
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,520
is if you like a math you know a

2431
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,679
visualizable

2432
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,040
way of

2433
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,840
looking at the information decomposition

2434
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,360
among the part of the particular

2435
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,639
partition

2436
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:45,040
in the context of

2437
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,280
the general case and the in the context

2438
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,760
of precise case just to visualize the

2439
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,760
constraints that lead to curious

2440
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,880
behavior

2441
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,800
so if you remember it is expected

2442
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,480
information gain

2443
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,639
that describes

2444
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,960
apparent curious behavior because

2445
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,840
actions become more likely if they

2446
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,840
increase expected or have a high

2447
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,239
expected information gain or resolve

2448
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,639
uncertainty or minimize entropy of a

2449
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,480
conditional sort

2450
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,600
so that this is if you like a a visual

2451
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,480
aid memoir or an unpacking

2452
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,800
of what can be quite dense

2453
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,239
and unintuitive expressions written out

2454
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,600
mathematically

2455
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,360
in terms of information theories and

2456
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,280
expected lagrangians or surprisals

2457
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,760
and mutual informations and i say that

2458
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,000
for thomas who's been because we've both

2459
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,080
been working on trying to get the

2460
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,119
simplest uh way of expressing these

2461
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:42,320
important

2462
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,520
constraints

2463
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,600
intuitively just using equations and

2464
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,440
it's not easy

2465
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,480
and the reason it's not easy

2466
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,239
is that in these information diagrams

2467
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,560
when there is no uncertainty

2468
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,960
when the uncertainty reaches the entropy

2469
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,040
reaches its lower bound the area

2470
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,760
disappears at which point for discrete

2471
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,679
systems the entropy is zero so when

2472
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,920
there's no uncertainty area is equal to

2473
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,199
zero h the uncertainty the entropy is

2474
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:12,719
equal to zero

2475
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,960
that's how it should be the problem is

2476
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,199
when shannon wrote down entropy for

2477
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,760
continuous systems that no longer holds

2478
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,159
and you get negative areas so there is

2479
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,280
no lower bound on the entropy of a

2480
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,840
continuous in the continu differential

2481
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,880
entropy

2482
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,719
um so you really have to go around the

2483
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:31,840
houses

2484
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,800
to recover um you know an area that

2485
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,679
disappears when in fact it uh it's lower

2486
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,400
bounded by minus infinity so that that

2487
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,080
particular bit just was for thomas

2488
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,679
because i've just emailed him today

2489
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,800
about that uh particular

2490
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,639
and james saw this problem with

2491
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,880
shannon's differential entropy you know

2492
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,840
decades and decades ago um

2493
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,440
and tried to repair it using something

2494
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,360
called continuous entropy and limiting

2495
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,480
density of discrete points uh so

2496
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,880
all of that worry and all those

2497
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,480
conditions just disappear if you just

2498
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,239
stick with this these nice information

2499
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,560
diagrams where you know that the

2500
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,639
if the area isn't there it's shrunk to

2501
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,040
zero

2502
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,040
awesome

2503
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,679
it's like you could be 110 sure

2504
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,239
about something

2505
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:23,799
let's go to

2506
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,639
figure five

2507
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,679
what is happening in figure five

2508
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,960
well i think figure five is is showing

2509
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,320
more or less what we've seen on the

2510
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,600
previous figures but never just

2511
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,679
interpreted in the context of in the

2512
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,440
context of neuroscience we've got the

2513
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,679
same action perception

2514
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,360
graphics we were talking about in figure

2515
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,600
two or the same equations

2516
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,400
um

2517
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,400
where the free energy is here being

2518
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,000
interpreted in terms of accuracy and

2519
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,159
complexity components

2520
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,239
and so that that brings us back to what

2521
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,520
we talk about in terms of the

2522
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,560
interpretation of free energy as a means

2523
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,679
of

2524
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,119
estimating marginal likelihood or

2525
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:08,880
approximating marginal likelihood and a

2526
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,960
bayesian model evidence and the models

2527
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,159
should be both as simple as possible

2528
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:15,920
while accurately accounting for some

2529
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,320
data

2530
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,159
and and i think that's here really to

2531
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,760
emphasize that interpretation of

2532
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,119
self-evidence and that we've we've

2533
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,119
spoken about before the idea that by

2534
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,880
minimizing your free and your free

2535
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,119
energy you were implicitly maximizing

2536
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,639
the evidence for some

2537
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,239
internal model

2538
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,000
and by putting this explicitly in terms

2539
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,119
of the brain

2540
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,520
um we're we're now talking about the

2541
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,960
kind of model that the brain might

2542
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,040
implicitly hold about the outside world

2543
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,840
and

2544
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,040
the kind of models that might be

2545
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,679
required the um

2546
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,840
sentient being appearing behavior

2547
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,679
and again a nice ring to suggest a

2548
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,920
mock-off blanket and

2549
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,719
put here explicitly

2550
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,360
many questions for another time about

2551
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,880
the order of the action perception loop

2552
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,760
and

2553
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,639
whether

2554
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:13,760
perception precedes action

2555
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,760
in principle or in different

2556
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,520
computational implementations how

2557
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,679
different aspects of the timing of the

2558
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,560
execution of different stages

2559
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,719
might converge upon similar outcomes and

2560
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,560
might not

2561
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,239
just noting it

2562
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:29,280
um

2563
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,760
in figure 6

2564
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,800
we have

2565
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,639
sentient behavior and action observation

2566
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,760
so what is being shown with a brain and

2567
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,880
with these

2568
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,679
three graphics beneath

2569
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,600
so this is a

2570
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,280
nice example of um of what's actually

2571
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,520
a slightly older version of active

2572
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,600
inference now and is a slightly

2573
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,280
different implementation than what we

2574
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,800
might use but i think it's a nice

2575
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
example in that

2576
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,239
it highlights the transition from

2577
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,320
behavior in terms of continuous

2578
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,080
differential equations through to

2579
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,920
something that's a bit more sequential

2580
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,119
and

2581
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:12,639
behaves in the way that we might

2582
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,880
actually think about plans as being one

2583
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,480
move and then the next move and then the

2584
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,000
thing after that

2585
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,480
um and an implicit discretization in

2586
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,679
time

2587
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,679
and and so that the

2588
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:24,560
the

2589
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:28,159
um the plot shown

2590
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:29,600
in sort of the upper left where we've

2591
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,400
got

2592
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,239
a series of lines that are kind of

2593
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,639
overlapping the red line in bold

2594
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:35,520
and

2595
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,920
exactly that one there

2596
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,800
is showing what is more or less a sort

2597
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,040
of predator-prey-like relationship that

2598
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,040
creates these sorts of sequences so if

2599
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,199
you can imagine this that that you have

2600
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,639
a

2601
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,760
alternation between a predator and

2602
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,600
some sort of prey

2603
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,880
whereas the

2604
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,000
prey population increases in size

2605
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,679
the predator population will also

2606
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,280
increase in size behind that as the

2607
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,080
predators have more to feed on

2608
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,159
which will in turn cause the prey

2609
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,320
population to drop followed again by the

2610
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,239
predator population dropping as food

2611
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:11,600
resources become

2612
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,880
um more scarce

2613
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,040
and and this is known as um as you've

2614
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,960
written here winnerless competition or

2615
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,320
as a lot of a full terror type dynamic

2616
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,000
and the generalization of this you can

2617
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,400
have many such sequences where one thing

2618
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,679
follows the other and you get this

2619
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,199
sequential

2620
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:33,040
set of peaks in what's going on here

2621
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,719
now if we would interpret each of those

2622
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,280
lines is representing the probability or

2623
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,440
the log probability or some some

2624
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,440
mapping to the probability of one of

2625
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:45,040
several alternative discrete states

2626
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,400
um categorical states so here imagine

2627
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,880
we're talking about blue blue green or

2628
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,480
red

2629
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,800
then we end up generating a sequence of

2630
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,440
blues greens reds depending upon the

2631
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,040
underlying dynamics so we have a

2632
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,119
continuous system that now has the feel

2633
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:04,320
of something sequential

2634
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,199
and what's happened here in in

2635
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,920
the graphic on top of the brain here

2636
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,560
is to associate each of those discrete

2637
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,320
categories with different points in

2638
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,600
space

2639
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,960
so we're now saying that uh if we're if

2640
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,480
we're looking at the blue points then

2641
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,760
that's going to be associated with this

2642
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,320
sort of upper left location in space or

2643
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,679
sorry there's a light blue as well bad

2644
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:28,960
choice of color to choose in my part

2645
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,400
um

2646
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,480
and so each of those sequences is then

2647
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,400
associated with a generative model that

2648
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,280
says

2649
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,880
i expect that when the blue status is

2650
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,040
present or the red state is present that

2651
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,360
my hand will be drawn towards

2652
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,600
one of those states and i predict that

2653
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,360
it's as if there is some sort of spring

2654
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,560
attached to from my hand to where that

2655
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,560
location is

2656
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,280
which means that as i as i infer this

2657
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,840
sequence i'm sequentially drawn to or i

2658
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,360
believe i'm being drawn to each of these

2659
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,520
locations in turn

2660
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,239
now if i'm predicting if my if my free

2661
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,920
energy or my marginal likelihood says

2662
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,159
that the most likely states are the ones

2663
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,159
that would occur if my arm were really

2664
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,000
being drawn in this direction the

2665
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,520
actions that then minimize the free

2666
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,119
energy are those that fulfill those

2667
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,880
predictions so all i have to do is

2668
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,119
predict when the kind of proprioceptive

2669
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,880
or visual data i might get based on

2670
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,440
where my hand is at any one point in in

2671
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,880
time

2672
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,600
and or predict where the the data that i

2673
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,679
would obtain if my hand really were

2674
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,840
being drawn in this direction

2675
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,600
and the resulting action fulfills

2676
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,679
exactly that and creates this sequence

2677
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,320
of movements and so what we get out is a

2678
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,639
relatively complex motor trajectory that

2679
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,400
has an almost autonomous type feel to it

2680
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,080
simply by predicting that i'm going to

2681
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,520
be drawn to each of these points in

2682
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,360
sequence

2683
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,639
and this is being used in this

2684
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:51,840
particular

2685
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,000
example as a way of simulating

2686
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
handwriting or something that appears to

2687
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,760
be like handwriting simply by moving the

2688
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
piece of paper underneath

2689
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,360
underneath where my hand is moving so

2690
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,199
that i end up with this sort of repeated

2691
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,800
pattern

2692
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,320
and you could imagine that in real

2693
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,679
writing that

2694
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:09,520
we may implicitly have a series of

2695
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,880
points that we would associate with

2696
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,639
different bits of the letters that would

2697
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,560
um effectively draw our hand around

2698
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,960
those letters as we write them

2699
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,520
cool and categorical shifts at the

2700
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,080
letter scale at the word scale and so on

2701
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,719
could be modeled in a in a hierarchical

2702
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:25,760
way

2703
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,239
absolutely and that that sort of

2704
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,480
exactly the point in terms of this move

2705
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,600
from this um this formulation of active

2706
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,920
inference that used to be used now to

2707
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,600
explicitly writing down a series of

2708
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,159
discrete categorical states and as you

2709
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,199
say putting that together in a

2710
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,040
hierarchical model

2711
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,119
where you can now mix predictions of a

2712
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,600
discrete categorical sort with short

2713
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,600
trajectories in a continuous

2714
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,719
state and a continuous state space

2715
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,040
awesome we'll complete our lightning

2716
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,520
tour of the last three figures

2717
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,320
so

2718
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,440
here's figure seven

2719
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,239
just

2720
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,960
um for for reference we looked at figure

2721
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,000
three

2722
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,080
we saw some faces and names and now

2723
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,480
we're seeing figure seven

2724
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,519
what is being shown here

2725
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,520
so here i think we're dealing with what

2726
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,440
what is a limitation of what we saw on

2727
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,199
the previous slide

2728
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:23,600
so when we were thinking about these

2729
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,520
fairly complex trajectories that had an

2730
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,560
almost autonomous feel like to them

2731
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,040
um it's still only a relatively simple

2732
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,480
sort of behavior

2733
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,560
implicitly it's just dealing with the

2734
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,880
replication of some potentially quite

2735
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,600
complex or even arbitrary pattern

2736
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,159
um but to become really autonomous to to

2737
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:47,119
behave in an intelligent like way

2738
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:48,800
really what we need is to be able to

2739
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,119
select between alternative sequences and

2740
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,960
alternative patterns

2741
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,360
and what this slide is showing us is

2742
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:58,320
this idea this one way or

2743
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,159
the way that we appear to evaluate

2744
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,199
different

2745
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,080
trajectories or the probability of of

2746
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,080
pursuing those trajectories

2747
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,920
is in terms of this expected free energy

2748
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,920
function which can be decomposed in a

2749
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,760
similar way to to what we expect of the

2750
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,000
free energy function so because in blue

2751
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,199
the free energy functional being

2752
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,040
decomposed into our complexity and

2753
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,480
accuracy terms and various other

2754
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,480
decompositions

2755
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,440
but in the in the upper panel um we're

2756
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,199
now looking at the decomposition of the

2757
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:27,520
expected free energy

2758
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,080
into into analogous type terms and we've

2759
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,760
spoken about some of those already so

2760
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,600
here the intrinsic value is equivalent

2761
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,520
to the information gain we were speaking

2762
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,920
about before

2763
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,000
whereas the extrinsic value is more like

2764
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,239
our

2765
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,199
expected utility or

2766
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,960
the the degree to which we prefer a

2767
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,199
particular outcome

2768
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,040
um and just as on the previous slide

2769
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,280
each of the faces relates to different

2770
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,040
ways that that can be interpreted under

2771
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,159
specific circumstances where then

2772
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,000
where particular parts of

2773
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,480
that expression are irrelevant um or

2774
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,199
don't master so in the absence of

2775
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,360
ambiguity we end up with behaviors that

2776
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,760
are entirely risk driven

2777
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,480
and so we might get back to things like

2778
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:16,559
kale control type formulations

2779
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,159
any notes or we'll go to eight

2780
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,638
okay

2781
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,840
here we are in eight

2782
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,800
i thought for a second that we've seen

2783
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,440
this before but um it's a subtly

2784
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,639
different reworking of one of the

2785
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,080
previous figures isn't it with them

2786
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,159
here's five with the expected free

2787
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:45,119
energy yeah correct f in five and then

2788
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,800
just an a path and now we have

2789
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,560
um in eight

2790
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,800
g in the top

2791
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,239
i suppose this is the move that we were

2792
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,920
talking about before in terms of when

2793
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,080
the active states are effectively hidden

2794
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,000
from the internal states and becomes

2795
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,480
something that are themselves inferred

2796
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,080
um

2797
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,560
so you can see here the the absence of

2798
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,639
any arrow connecting a to the

2799
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,080
variational free energy box

2800
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,920
which is implicitly saying that the

2801
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,440
action itself is something that we have

2802
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,199
to draw inferences about

2803
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,440
and here the expected free energy is the

2804
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,400
way in which we can do that

2805
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:28,000
it's inference on action about action

2806
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,480
about the causes of action

2807
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,080
just many ways that have been

2808
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,679
highlighted for how

2809
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,440
inference and action are weaving

2810
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,719
together

2811
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,000
and different

2812
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,400
model architectures that might be

2813
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,000
more didactic

2814
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
more illustrative

2815
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,239
more pragmatic for a given context or a

2816
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:48,800
given type of thing that has a certain

2817
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,840
sparsity to its coupling

2818
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,320
and to

2819
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,320
close on figure 9 and then we can have

2820
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:01,559
last thoughts what is shown in figure 9

2821
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,960
so figure 9 is a nice example of the

2822
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,840
application of this information seeking

2823
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,560
aspect of the expected free energy

2824
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,840
and to a task in which um that there is

2825
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,520
uncertainty about the orientation of the

2826
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,920
face that's presented to the active

2827
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,159
infant scheme

2828
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,440
and

2829
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,280
the alternative trajectories the

2830
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,280
alternative parts of autonomous states

2831
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,119
that can be selected here are the

2832
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,800
alternative

2833
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,719
eye movements or circads that can be

2834
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,400
performed

2835
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,320
and so choosing the

2836
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,199
or

2837
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,880
evaluating the probability of each

2838
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,639
account depends upon evaluating the

2839
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,239
potential information gain associated

2840
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,760
with those

2841
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,040
which is effectively the information

2842
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,840
gain i get in terms of the eventual

2843
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
orientation of the face

2844
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,159
um i think in practice this

2845
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,480
if i remember rightly that this um

2846
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,480
formulation focused very much on the

2847
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,080
ambiguity term

2848
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:58,840
um

2849
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,920
and um i think a subsequently being

2850
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,719
updated in various ways but again it

2851
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:06,719
kind of focused on the the continuous

2852
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,239
schemes and

2853
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,880
um and provides a nice early example of

2854
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,920
how um information gains worked into the

2855
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,679
active inference type formulas we tend

2856
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:18,480
to use practically

2857
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:23,360
awesome in our final few minutes

2858
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,760
we we look at the questions that we've

2859
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,719
looked at the end of every live stream

2860
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,239
and

2861
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,400
it would be awesome to hear

2862
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,440
where things go from here from this

2863
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,480
recent

2864
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,360
preprint from the textbook

2865
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,760
what are some of the areas that any of

2866
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,960
you are

2867
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,679
interested in or that are now possible

2868
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,080
to head in

2869
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,480
i'll go first then i don't have to go

2870
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,119
last again

2871
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,639
difficult question to answer um

2872
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:13,280
there are so many ways you can take this

2873
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,400
i i think it's gone beyond the capacity

2874
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,400
of any single group or person to to

2875
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,560
really pursue all the all the directions

2876
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,639
so nearly every field that we've

2877
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:25,760
mentioned um you know is probably the

2878
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,920
focus of at least one if not you know

2879
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,960
several groups um around the world small

2880
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,800
embryonic groups but certainly working

2881
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,840
earnestly on uh the different levels of

2882
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,400
of application um technically what what

2883
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,960
thomas and i um no that's not quite true

2884
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,560
one thing that thomas and i have been

2885
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,440
doing

2886
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,320
is um trying to write the next simpler

2887
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,560
paper um so the your the the free energy

2888
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,639
principle made simpler

2889
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:55,599
already

2890
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:57,760
wasn't that simple in the end so the

2891
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,920
idea is now to

2892
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,040
work towards a four-page paper that has

2893
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,400
everything you need to know to

2894
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,480
understand the free energy principle

2895
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,560
the most recent ones down to abouts of

2896
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,400
eight pages

2897
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,719
and what it does is it just drills down

2898
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,440
on the path integral formulation

2899
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,199
and in particular

2900
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,360
the simplifications afforded by not

2901
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,040
worrying about non-equilibrium

2902
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,719
steady-state densities and just looking

2903
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,880
at the densities over paths and just

2904
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,560
taking away all the unnecessary

2905
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,480
equations and this drilling down on what

2906
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,760
matters

2907
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,080
and to me what really matters is in the

2908
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,599
last

2909
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,960
sentence here and implicit in the last

2910
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,840
figure that you were discussing

2911
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,520
which is curiosity

2912
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,360
which i think is the key thing that

2913
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,400
distinguishes current ai from agi and

2914
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,000
you know true intelligence and

2915
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,400
understanding um resolving uncertainty

2916
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,719
about your sense-making understanding of

2917
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,239
a world and understanding the

2918
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,159
mathematical imperatives that describe

2919
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,880
that kind of behavior so this is i'll

2920
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
end where i started which is all about

2921
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,840
curiosity

2922
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,000
excellent thank you

2923
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,400
thomas

2924
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:15,199
as god says it is a really difficult

2925
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:18,080
series of questions to answer and

2926
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,000
they're i think there are always more

2927
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,599
interesting directions to go in than

2928
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:23,280
there is time to pursue them which is

2929
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,800
why

2930
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,159
again as carl says it's important that

2931
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:28,000
there are so many groups out there who

2932
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,080
are taking an interest and focusing in

2933
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,239
on these issues

2934
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,440
um

2935
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,960
certainly the idea of making things

2936
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,320
simpler i think is an important

2937
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,840
direction to going

2938
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,199
um i think it's also

2939
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,199
for me one of the interesting things is

2940
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:46,560
um it is also thinking about application

2941
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,000
in

2942
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,520
the setting of

2943
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,800
disease processes and trying to

2944
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,840
understand how um

2945
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,159
how different disease processes can be

2946
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,960
framed in terms of alternative priors

2947
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,040
and just as a way of

2948
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,360
i hope at some point providing useful

2949
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,679
clinical characterizations of different

2950
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:08,400
um kinds of pathology different kinds of

2951
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,239
trajectories and different kinds of

2952
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,639
steady states um

2953
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,000
and

2954
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,679
understanding how different therapeutic

2955
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,760
options might change the path through

2956
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,320
some um some space of

2957
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,239
prior beliefs at various different

2958
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:23,920
temporal and spatial scales as we've

2959
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,440
spoken about

2960
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,280
and so for me i think that that's one of

2961
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,800
the areas i'm particularly interested in

2962
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,679
seeing how things develop

2963
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,639
thank you blue

2964
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,320
as i was saying the other day i'm really

2965
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,599
starting to

2966
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,159
think of active inference the way that

2967
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,840
like in every

2968
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,760
in every situation and in every

2969
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,000
circumstance that i find myself in

2970
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,239
i find myself wondering

2971
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:52,400
how can i formulate this in an active

2972
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,199
inference model and i did the same thing

2973
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:56,560
when i was in art school and learning

2974
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,800
how to draw in a very realistic way i

2975
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,360
was learning to draw people and objects

2976
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,360
in the way that i saw them

2977
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,400
and now i'm i'm looking at situations

2978
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,679
that i find myself in and um you know

2979
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,920
where before i would be in conversation

2980
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,840
with someone looking at their earlobe

2981
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,360
like wondering how can i best like

2982
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,480
represent that on a piece of paper um

2983
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,560
now i find myself in situations like

2984
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,000
wondering how would this fit into the

2985
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,639
active inference framework so i think

2986
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,400
that there are many um

2987
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,719
that the horizon is very broad and there

2988
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,360
are many avenues where we can

2989
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,679
tread

2990
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:37,199
the art and science of curiosity

2991
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,520
so it's an excellent conclusion

2992
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,239
carl and thomas thank you for joining

2993
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,000
these discussions

2994
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,280
and

2995
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,639
everyone who

2996
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,280
is listening

2997
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,440
thank you and we hope to see you in

2998
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,800
actin flab or in any other

2999
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,760
fractal aspect of what we're all doing

3000
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,239
so thanks again everybody thanks blue

3001
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:01,040
and

3002
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,159
see you in the next discussion

3003
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:07,159
bye

3004
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,199
you
