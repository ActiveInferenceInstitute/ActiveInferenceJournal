"Friedman","00;00;25;01","00;00;57;15","Hello everyone. It is ActInfLab Livestream number 45.0. It's May 27th 2022 and we're discussing the paper the free energy principle made simpler but not too simple. Welcome to the ActInfLab. We're participatory online live that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this slide. This is a recorded in an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Friedman","00;00;58;15","00;01;30;22","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams. If you want to learn more about the live streams or any of the other projects to get involved at Acton Lab, head over to Active Inference North in stream number 45.0. Our goal is to learn and discuss this very interesting paper "The Free Energy Principle Made Simpler But Not Too Simple" by Karl Friston, Lancelot Da Costa, Noor Sajid,"
"Friedman","00;01;31;04","00;02;08;17","Conor Heins, Kai Ueltzhoeffer, Grigorios Pavliotis, and Thomas Parr. And just like with all the dot zero videos and indeed all the videos, this is an introduction and an overview to a quite technical and lengthy ish paper. It's not a review or a final word this is like the opening context for some of the coming discussions we're going to have in the following weeks and beyond, and we're going to first just say hello, introduce the big question, the aims, claims, abstract and roadmap."
"Friedman","00;02;09;03","00;02;30;10","Then we're going to give an overview of some of the keywords that are in the paper. Then we're going to go through the sections of the paper with a focus on some of the key points, the formalisms and the figures, especially so it should be a great discussion and let's get into it. We'll start with just an introduction and saying Hello."
"Friedman","00;02;30;17","00;02;40;07","So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I'll pass to Brock. Brock, thanks for joining and for all the contributions in this dot zero."
"McKean","00;02;41;11","00;03;04;01","Yeah, so exciting to be here to spend in ActInfLab and yeah, I'm just really drawn to this topic and this paper is a great starting point for that. It's really got a lot of detail that to dig into and a lot to learn. So yeah."
"Friedman","00;03;04;16","00;03;33;16","OK, so one of the big questions or one way to state the big question was what are the foundations of the free energy principle? And what does it contribute in the paper? They write that they start from a description of the world in terms of a random dynamical system, systems changing through time and end up with the description of self-organization as sentient sensing, active behavior."
"Friedman","00;03;33;21","00;03;52;05","And that's active inference. So that's the question that we're wondering about. We're all wondering about what is the basis and the essence and the implications of the free energy principle. What would you say about that, or what were some big questions that you had coming into and out of this paper?"
"McKean","00;03;56;15","00;04;14;09","My biggest question around, like the free energy principle is kind of it's general. How general is it where does it end? Because it seems so they say in the paper also it's like it's pretty simple. So kind of ideological in some sense."
"McKean","00;04;17;01","00;04;39;22","So yeah, that's one of my questions. Where does it begin? Where does it end? And like how general is it? The other question is, yeah, how how does it emerge or what does it look like at different scales?"
"Friedman","00;04;41;18","00;05;07;25","Awesome. So we'll be returning to questions again and again. Let's check out the aims and the claims of the paper. So again, that's the free energy principle made simpler but not too simple. And the authors are listed here. The paper describes that it's trying to present the free energy principle as simply as possible. But without sacrificing too much technical detail."
"Friedman","00;05;08;11","00;05;38;03","And that's sort of a pun slash self reference spewing. That's what modeling in that perretto optimal or Bayes optimal way is. And that's going to come back as a theme again and again, giving information, but not overfitting nor under fitting. And then several claims that they make are that they're going to step through the formal arguments that lead from the description of a world as random dynamical system to the description of self-organization in terms of active inference and self evidencing."
"Friedman","00;05;39;05","00;06;06;26","They're going to discuss Bayesian mechanics and how those Bayesian mechanics have the same starting point as quantum statistical and classical mechanics. And then they're going to differentiate this Bayesian mechanics for particular systems from some of these previously mentioned mechanics, in that careful attention is paid to the way that the internal states of something couple to its external states."
"Friedman","00;06;08;04","00;06;15;16","Some of the aims and claims, although many more will be introduced and are discussed in the paper any thoughts on that?"
"Friedman","00;06;17;22","00;06;19;21","Or if you'd like to? Oh yeah."
"McKean","00;06;19;21","00;06;51;05","Got yeah. Just well that essentially that it's, you know, it's a self evidencing, self describing system again, just very it seems to fit with a lot of different domains and a lot of like just observed experience so cool."
"Friedman","00;06;51;09","00;06;53;15","Would you like to read the abstract."
"McKean","00;06;55;26","00;08;03;29","For this paper provides a concise description of the free energy principle starting from a formulation of random dynamical systems in terms of a given equation and ending with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentence. It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail establishing a particular partition of states based on conditional and dependencies inherent from specially coupled dynamics to unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and three describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action to only logically the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organization in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision making"
"McKean","00;08;04;19","00;08;29;02","in the sense of maximizing marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of dynamic systems, we end up with a description of self-organization as sensing behavior that can be interpreted as self evidencing, namely self-assembly of places or active inference awesome."
"Friedman","00;08;29;16","00;08;54;29","OK, let's go to the roadmap. So this paper has layout and it'll be awesome to hear from the authors about why they've laid it out as well as numerous other details. So we're looking forward to those discussions in Section one is in introduction, and they wrote at the end of the introduction, the remaining sections describe the free energy principle."
"Friedman","00;08;55;13","00;09;22;08","Each section that's two through eight focuses on an equation or sections. The ensuing narrative is meant to be concise, taking us from the beginning to the end as succinctly as possible to avoid disrupting the narrative. We use footnotes to address questions that are commonly asked at each step we also use figure legends captions to supplement the narrative with examples from neurobiology."
"Friedman","00;09;22;26","00;10;03;04","So there's a main narrative thread that's going to touch on sections two through eight, each of these being like a single or a cluster of formalisms, and then especially in the footnotes which are formulated as questions and in the figure captions, which are sometimes quite lengthy and include examples and citations and so on. More of the biological details and inspiration are added, but the main line narrative is going to be touching on these formal areas, systems, states and fluctuation study states and non equilibrium."
"Friedman","00;10;03;04","00;10;42;17","Three particles partitions and things in for self-organization to self evidencing in five Lagrangian generalized states and Bayesian filtering and six statistical to classical particles and seven path integrals, planning and curious particles in eight and Section nine will be a conclusion. So we're going to next discuss the key words at an overview level and just describe like some of the broader topics that might lead someone to find this paper or be curious about it or want to cite it in one of those domains."
"Friedman","00;10;43;01","00;11;17;08","And then we're going to just jump right into the introduction. Each of the nine sections will be clearly indicated which section we're in, and we'll be following the order of the paper bringing in a few other resources as we saw fit in the preparation. And we're just going to focus on some of the dots connecting a few and leaving many, many for the dot one and the dot two discussions because it's again, a paper with a lot of formalisms and a lot of rich topics."
"Friedman","00;11;17;18","00;11;30;24","So we're just going to give this overview and try to frontload the contextualization and then continue to unpack and develop this and work on our shared understanding in the coming weeks."
"Friedman","00;11;33;04","00;11;47;25","The keywords that were listed were Bayesian non equilibrium self-organization, variational inference, and Markov Blanket. So PROC tell us about Bayesian."
"McKean","00;11;51;13","00;13;01;16","Bayesian analysis so it's basically a analysis method for determining the posterior probability, which is basically your inactive inference and it's going to be something like your beliefs after having evidence added to your prior beliefs, which are something proximately like a hypothesis. So you have the equation here and also where an explanation that's essentially what I just said. So you're adding observation to hypothesis and changing, trying to reduce the trying to approximate the this period to be here over E three probability."
"McKean","00;13;01;21","00;13;19;04","So is pretty foundational to a lot of statistics on physics and other things thank you."
"Friedman","00;13;19;05","00;13;49;29","Yes, totally agreed. Bayesian statistics, it's a big topic. And just like you said, it's about how prior beliefs meet incoming evidence and how that is updated to form posterior, you know, after the evidence beliefs versus before the evidence. And that can be done in this continuous cycle. And a lot of the variables that we're going to be seeing and talking about have interpretations of being one of these."
"Friedman","00;13;51;02","00;14;14;27","For example, it might be a variable that represents a systems prior about something or something might come in and that might be evidence. So we're going to be working within a Bayesian statistical framework rather than, for example, a Frequentist P value driven statistical framework. But we'll come to these details along the way. How about non equilibrium."
"McKean","00;14;18;06","00;15;10;24","This is I think a much fuzzier topic the tradition, like historically, you know, science studied like equilibrium state systems and non equilibrium state systems are like more relatively newer things and so non equilibrium is, is these are things that were mentioned in the papers like flows between transitions of between like a finite sets of states having an attractor in a system that over time the predictable perturbations in the system so act as a set of characteristic states to which the system's attracted over time."
"McKean","00;15;12;16","00;15;31;25","So non equilibrium being like a higher energy level state that is you know it's local environment but nonetheless distinct, definite, separate and over time continuous."
"Friedman","00;15;34;21","00;15;59;08","So just looking at the animation you put here, it's like the brick at some time scale is out of equilibrium, like the brick will also dissolve. But for some model of a certain time frame hours, it could be seen as being spatially or just materially in an equilibrium and then looking at these two moving entities, it's kind of like two kinds of non equilibrium."
"Friedman","00;15;59;22","00;16;24;13","There's like the low bar non equilibrium this mechanical bird on the right side, the water dipper. And so it is returning to these characteristic states. It's not just staying in one location it's returning to drink the water again and again. So it's not in spatial equilibrium, but also there's like this stationary or there's something about it that is constrained."
"Friedman","00;16;25;01","00;16;53;10","And then the ostensibly living bird, I guess the on the cartoon on the left is like non equilibrium of an even higher or more complex type because that bird might like fly away or do something else. So there's like a gradient from things that are like the ball at the bottom of the ball in equilibrium and then progressively mechanical systems that are returning to attracting states."
"Friedman","00;16;53;20","00;17;08;17","And then what does it mean for biological systems to be or to be modeled as returning to attracting states like sleep or a certain body temperature or certain blood glucose? Any other thoughts on that or we can carry on?"
"McKean","00;17;09;12","00;17;33;06","Yeah, just yeah, this is a different time scale set of states larger, smaller and navigating traversing those states. Yeah, internal. And so I guess it just depends where you're drawing the the time scale. Awesome. But they can be modeled differently like that, right?"
"Friedman","00;17;34;03","00;17;36;01","How about self-organization?"
"McKean","00;17;39;00","00;18;24;00","I think this one like maybe it sounds like just this complex, but I think this is like really familiar for most people. They have a good idea of what this is and they have these like examples here of, of non equilibrium systems that have some symmetry asymmetry of constraints that over time causes them to take a particular path through that you know, set of states towards one attractor or another."
"McKean","00;18;25;12","00;19;06;00","So your meiosis and mitosis, your black hole mergers, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, very large, very small in between scales here in the paper referencing at they were they said it was AVP was about kind of turning on its head this traditional what what must things do in order to exist framing of systems and physics to if if it exists and what must they do."
"McKean","00;19;06;14","00;19;47;10","And so this is saying you know we have now a Bayesian evidence of black hole mergers. What must it be doing for that data now that new evidence to yeah. Exist like what how will how does nuclear fusion how does that turn into two atoms turning into one atom. What must it be? Do it instead of the other way round awesome."
"Friedman","00;19;47;10","00;20;16;01","Yeah. Big topic. Many angles on it. But sometimes those inversions like Axle Constance paper that we discussed in live stream 34 with, it's about how you got there. So conditional on something which we're going to return to existing, being perceived, being modeled, what must that thing be doing in order to exist? Not what has to happen for the thing to exist."
"Friedman","00;20;16;01","00;20;29;22","But we're going to come back to that. And then the last two, we'll just give a first coat of paint because we're going to see them in their tactical glory soon. So what is variational inference about."
"McKean","00;20;32;14","00;21;17;14","I'm actually less clear on this, but a related to Bayesian inference, it's about approximating that posterior probability, the after things happen like. But what to what resolution can you kind of what precision can you state about that? And also we try to have a lower bound or the marginal likelihood of evidence of the observed things. So how likely are you to see the data that would cause that to be that would lead to the posterior probability being what it is?"
"McKean","00;21;18;14","00;21;21;27","That was my understanding. Of this."
"Friedman","00;21;23;23","00;21;54;12","Yeah, awesome. How close what is the divergence? It'll be awesome to hear the authors and others perspectives, but places where we've seen Variational Bayesian inference before. First off, it's not an innovation of active inference. Variational, auto, encoders and variational Bayesian methods are being used in active inference with the partial novelty of action being considered as a parameter rather than just sensory parameters."
"Friedman","00;21;54;28","00;22;32;18","But it's used in situations where exact Bayes is intractable and sampling based approaches like Monte Karlo are also not tractable or not plausible. And so variational inference is about minimizing the divergence between Q and P mind your Q's and P's, as they say up there, and making sure that Q is from a family of distributions that is tractable and easy to optimize, even if P is something that is challenging, instead a different distribution."
"Friedman","00;22;32;24","00;23;02;02","For example, one that has a shape looking more like a parabola, more like a ball can be fit with Q, and then there's still some detail, like if P truly were bimodal, would you want the one that identifies and rescue on top of one hump and ignores the other hump, or would you want the Q that is kind of centered at a place where neither of the P pumps are but contains some density in both."
"Friedman","00;23;02;07","00;23;36;25","So those are some detail questions. But in general, it's about minimizing the divergence between Q and P as a means of approximating what exact Bayes would be doing in the asymptote. If the divergence were zero, you would be having the perfect approximation of Q on P and then anywhere other than the divergence being zero, there's a monotonic way for you to get towards that and then Mark Blanket, which we're going to come to in multiple formalisms."
"Friedman","00;23;36;25","00;23;41;18","But just what comes to mind when you hear Marco Blanket and what do you want to show here?"
"McKean","00;23;43;06","00;24;24;20","Everything. This one is like, I feel like this is the most easy to understand. One, somehow it's like this picture here you can see is a bunch of dots that are different colors, right? And you have like a circular concentric circles here. And that's, you know, that this large into the large square scale there is this like yellow line that separates all the outside, dark blue from the inside, orange and red and but there's also an orange inside circle."
"McKean","00;24;25;12","00;24;40;04","These these yellow and orange are kind of in a in a relationship that keeps the dark blue and the red separate, independent of each other."
"McKean","00;24;42;04","00;25;20;02","But you also have these of these smaller scale inside the red, inside the yellow, inside the orange here. Right. These other scale of the same thing like that. It is in some sense either recursive or fractal or locally having this same kind of dynamic of two layers conditioned on each other to keep an external and internal state independent of each other."
"Friedman","00;25;23;29","00;25;24;11","Also."
"McKean","00;25;24;20","00;25;27;05","Yes, which is everything. I feel like."
"Friedman","00;25;28;28","00;26;05;20","It's every thing which we're going to bring to mind this space and it's an exciting topic and there's a lot of ongoing discussions and developments. Here's a recent paper by Kasper Hespe, and there's many other valuable commentaries on emperor's new called Blankets by Yellow Brandenburg, which was previously on The Live Stream. So there's many, many technical and philosophical and implementation discussions around identifying Mark Owl blankets, reassigning them and so on."
"Friedman","00;26;06;15","00;26;45;29","And we're going to get there. So into the peep we go. We're in Section one introduction they write It is said that the free energy principle is difficult to understand. No citation. You saying that no one is saying that. This is ironic on three counts. First, the step is so simple that it is almost tautological circular reasoning indeed, philosophical accounts compare its explanation to what it explains to a desert landscape in the sense of a coyote in desert landscape as per what Clark wrote."
"Friedman","00;26;45;29","00;27;10;08","And we'll return to that in a second. A second reason for the irony is a tenet of the AVP is that everything must provide an accurate account of things that is as simple as possible, including itself. Finally, the FSP rests on straightforward results from statistical physics. So one is it's not difficult to understand. It's so simple. It's circular."
"Friedman","00;27;10;29","00;27;40;01","Two is how can it be difficult to understand when everything is as simple as it must be, including the FIP literature that's at some high level irony and then the third reason is how could it be difficult to understand when it rests on straightforward results from statistical physics? And then I just wanted to highlight this Clark 2013 citation and the desert landscape, because that seems like kind of like a oblique reference."
"Friedman","00;27;41;09","00;28;13;05","But here's what Clark and also here's two representations of desert landscapes. So they're not all bad, in fact. But what Clark wrote was referring to radical isms that might exist within this framework in extending the models to include action, action oriented predictive processing which is very, very similar to active inference. We might simultaneously do away with the need to appeal to goals and rewards, replacing them with a more austere construct of predictions."
"Friedman","00;28;13;23","00;28;46;10","So I don't want to do this or I'm not rewarded by doing that. I'm just making predictions and expectations about what might happen and then fulfilling them or diverging from those fulfillments. And so that is this desert landscape vision. There are neither goals nor reward signals as such. Instead, there are only learned and species specific. So kind of developmental and evolutionary expectations across spatial and temporal scales that are in control of perception, action loops."
"Friedman","00;28;47;00","00;29;15;16","And so what are we explaining or explaining away? That's this desert landscape notion, and that's how the authors are beginning the paper with a sort of preemptive tripartite broadside, dissuading one from thinking that this is going to be difficult to understand before launching into the subsequent eight sections that might give you some evidence to the contrary, but yeah."
"Friedman","00;29;15;20","00;29;17;05","Any thoughts on that?"
"McKean","00;29;20;21","00;29;54;25","I just thought the desert, the canyon desert landscape, very apt description and yeah, physical sort of. Yeah, the lines up and yeah, like I said, this, it does seem tautological like a lot of these concepts, if you think about them from like the statistical physics, it's like obviously. But then there's just a lot of area there to be covered, right?"
"Friedman","00;29;55;27","00;30;09;14","Yes. And also note that Clark in 2013 wrote I remain unconvinced. Even if the austere description is possible, this would not justify the claim that this is the better tool for understanding the cognitive economy."
"McKean","00;30;09;24","00;30;17;09","So it's, it is intractable. So it's like what? Yeah. Yep. Awesome."
"Friedman","00;30;18;04","00;30;41;06","So still in the introduction, the author's right before starting, it might help to clarify what the free energy principle is and why this big question alert. Many theories in the biological sciences are answers to the question what must things do in order to exist? And some answers. But we could think of probably many others that people have raised."
"Friedman","00;30;41;12","00;31;05;10","So if you asked somebody, what does something have to do in order to exist, some answers could be like, well, it has to resist dissipation. And it has to replicate, or it has to reproduce or propagate some way. Like there's stuff it has to do to be there. The step turns this question on its head and asks If things exist, what must they do more formally?"
"Friedman","00;31;05;15","00;31;33;27","If we can define what it means to be something can we identify the physics or dynamics that that thing must possess? To answer this question, the MVP calls on some mathematical truisms that follow from each other. Then they write much like Hamilton's principle of least action. The MVP is not a falsifiable theory about the way things behave. It is a description of things that are defined in a particular way."
"Friedman","00;31;34;18","00;32;11;22","And for more reading on this here's a 2018 interview with Forger and myself and with Karl Freston. And here there's some discussion around notions of Falsifiability can the FFP be falsified or what is the relevance of falsification, which is a frequentist idea in this Bayesian meta, Bayesian post, Bayesian, whatever epoch or mode that we're in. And just one really interesting quote is from Karl."
"Friedman","00;32;11;29","00;33;08;17","I would assert that the notion that a framework can have the attribute falsifiable is a category error. The notion of false stability is thus a very weak notion because it's actually reflecting rejecting a no hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis that has some limitations including the sort of the transcendental arguments on falsification, which is just that belief is rarely scrutinized using a falsification ist framework and then dropping from the transcendental arguments into a more history of statistics and science when we move from Frequentist towards Bayesian statistics, where the P value and so on, and the parametric distributions are seen as like special cases, but not the whole substance of the statistics."
"Friedman","00;33;09;22","00;33;33;22","Karl suggesting that a better way to frame evidence based selection of hypotheses, which is ostensibly what falsification is after as well, is in terms of how much empirical evidence is accrued by competing hypotheses and that's quite a different model than can then falsify the ones that aren't true, but shoot down the ones that don't exist. So this is quite an interesting area."
"Friedman","00;33;35;06","00;33;37;01","What would you say or adds this."
"McKean","00;33;38;22","00;34;12;28","Is a word verisimilitude. I think that is exactly what he's describing here. Again, just how much evidence is accrued rather than. Yeah, I mean, that's in practice how it works. So I don't completely understand the notion of Falsifiability as it's really important. But like Dirac had this notion of beauty or and he's saying, look at the equations really beautiful."
"McKean","00;34;13;25","00;34;47;25","Then maybe you check your experiment first. So like you were saying, it's kind of like that's not falsifiable, but then what do you mean by not falsifiable? And that is that you're not examining that claim. It's kind of there's a you know, infinite regression there of falsifiability that makes it intractable, which is why taking the opposite approach of just stacking up the evidence is you know, a way to make the sentence the same thing, you know, but a tractable version of it, right?"
"Friedman","00;34;48;03","00;35;14;27","So awesome. The right again, picking up on that last quotation there that the FP is not a falsifiable theory about the way things behave. It's a description of things that are defined in a particular way. Let's talk about utility is such a description. If the FP is indeed a description, is it useful in itself? The answer is probably no."
"Friedman","00;35;15;04","00;35;43;21","Oh, well, then we can stop reading in the sense that the principle of least action does not tell you how to throw a ball. However, the principle of least action furnishes everything we need to know to simulate the trajectory of a ball. In a particular instance, in the same sense, the FP allows one to simulate and predict the sentiment behavior of a particle person, artifact or agent i.e. some thing."
"Friedman","00;35;44;22","00;35;54;05","This allows one to build sensing artifacts or use simulations as observation models of particles or of those other mentioned types of systems."
"Friedman","00;35;56;13","00;36;27;21","These simulations rest upon specifying a generative model that is apt to describe the behavior of the particle or person at hand. At this point, committing to a specific generative model can be taken as a commitment to a specific and falsifiable theory later we will see examples of these simulations. So it's like the linear regression concept is not even where you would want to focus the brunt of your falsifying effort."
"Friedman","00;36;28;12","00;36;56;22","But if there are two different linear regression models, we might ask which one is preferable or which one is falsified by doing some subsequent perturbation or experiments? But the linear regression framework is like a framework, hence not falsifiable in the way that people often expect and deploying a specific generative model analogous to like a specific linear regression model, but different."
"Friedman","00;36;57;19","00;37;13;29","That is where there's a commitment to a falsifiable theory. I think the amygdala connects to this. That way that could be tested and that evidence could be evaluated within a falsification or Bayesian Bayes factor framework."
"Friedman","00;37;16;15","00;37;34;15","Falsifying the concept of generative models. They would be have crossed that bridge and now could be engaging in falsification and evidence comparison within some constrained space. Anything to, I don't know, as we close the introduction."
"McKean","00;37;36;03","00;38;06;09","To just again, the linear model versus a generative model of like the linear model will yield some approximation that's not necessarily a real possible observation to falsify. The generative model will produce many things that you might not observe possibly, but some that you will and then could potentially be falsified like you give specific examples."
"Friedman","00;38;06;09","00;38;30;18","So yes, it's almost like it takes this this me so scale and it, it separates the, the milk from the cream and the ATP wise over falsification. And then once you're committed to a specific generative model, it's actually written down, not just speculated that it could be written down then it's like, oh, well then it's trivial or against it."
"Friedman","00;38;31;01","00;39;00;18","So it kind of separated out the framework like language as a framework like Dave just mentioned in the chat how would you falsify a language you would not any more than you would falsify a conceptual framework. So one could falsify a language like English but things that are said within English might be amenable to being tested once they're actually said using that framework and interest."
"McKean","00;39;00;18","00;39;08;08","Evidence stacked up or not versus alternatives, just like language or Evolutionism."
"Friedman","00;39;09;06","00;39;36;20","So recall the roadmap. We're now going to head into the next sections, each of which is going to be building on each other in this concise narrative however, also semi standalone in their focus, and we're just going to do basically a first pass and some contextual zation because we have a lot of time in the coming weeks to discuss these topics in more detail."
"Friedman","00;39;37;13","00;40;11;14","So we're going to go to Section two systems, states and fluctuations. OK, so they write, we start by describing the world with the stochastic differential equation, the orders 2014. So this is a citation to the book Stochastic Processes and applications of diffusion processes and just one preliminary note, this is not the same sentence as the world is a stochastic differential equation."
"Friedman","00;40;12;14","00;40;40;27","We start by describing the world with a stochastic differential equation. So leave your realism at the door. We're describing models here they write, Why start here? The principal reason is that we want a description that is consistent with physics. Here's some discussion questions. What does it mean to be consistent with physics? What does it mean to be consistent with physics in theory or in principle or in practice?"
"Friedman","00;40;41;28","00;41;15;02","And then they write this follows because things like the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics area, a fluctuation theorems in statistical mechanics area B and Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics. Area C, three different mechanics, quantum statistical and classical can all be derived from this starting point. So we're going back to like the last common ancestor of those three different mechanics."
"Friedman","00;41;15;24","00;41;35;06","And then that is where Bayesian mechanics is going to also be initiated from. In short, if one wants a physics of sentence, this is the place to start. Why start? Where where are we going? Why are we going anything you want to out here?"
"McKean","00;41;42;24","00;42;01;02","No, I think again, just that you know, that that's all these skip physics it's it's odd that you would be able to reproduce, you know, derive all these things from something that's not fundamental or important in some way."
"Friedman","00;42;01;24","00;42;32;25","So often they write, we are interested in systems that have characteristic states. This means the system has a pullback attractor. The sets of states that the system will come to occupy from any initial state. So the rubber band is going to pull back to its resting state if it's allowed to. And formalism, that stochastic differential equation describing the rate of change of the states."
"Friedman","00;42;33;03","00;43;02;13","So X are the states, the towers is the time and the dot notation is the derivative with respect to type. So how states are changing is equal to their flow f of x, f for flow and random fluctuations. Omega. So like a signal and a noise term, there's the the flow, the ocean current, and then there's the vibration that isn't the directed flow."
"Friedman","00;43;03;01","00;43;36;22","And this separation of scales is going to come back again and again. So dot notation again means the derivative with respect to time. So how things are changing with respect to time through time, this yellow means that time and causality are baked into everything that follows in the sense that states cause their motion this equation is itself an approximation to a simpler mapping from some variables to changes in those variables with time."
"Friedman","00;43;38;05","00;44;06;08","This follows from the separation into states and random fluctuations implicit in formalism, one where states change slowly in relation to fast fluctuations so if this term the noise term is dominance, then there will not be movements flow like movement on a manifold there's some more details, but things are changing in different ways."
"Friedman","00;44;08;12","00;44;38;26","Different kind of stochastic equations that are going to be presented here and in the book and in the citations, they help us see different parts of how we can use dynamical models to understand physics and specifically the physics of particular cognitive slosh. Tensions systems then in the footnote, they ask a question Why is the flow not a function of time?"
"Friedman","00;44;39;15","00;45;08;11","And that's what we're going to return to in dot one. How is time dealt with or not dealt with similarly or differently than other frameworks or other physics and then just to stay on this formalism one and then please give any other thoughts. This last line of one, he of X equals question mark the next step shared by all physics."
"Friedman","00;45;08;24","00;45;39;07","So those three areas that we described, classical, statistical, quantum and Bayesian is to ask whether anything can be said about the probability density over the states, the question mark in one. So this is the common grounding this is the last common ancestor of the multiple physics. And now we're going to take it in a different direction. A lot can be said about this probability density, Pyrex, which can be expressed in two complementary ways."
"Friedman","00;45;39;24","00;46;10;06","And this is going to introduce a very important distinction and dialectic. Here are the two complementary ways left side blue density dynamics using the Focker plank equation a.k.a also known as the forward Commodore of equation. Here's formalism to the Fokker Plank Equation describes the change in density due to random fluctuations and the flow of states through state space."
"Friedman","00;46;10;22","00;46;40;22","This is like a fields model and then the second complementary way in orange on the right side in terms of the probability of a path through state space using the path integral formulation and they write for formalism. Three. Conversely, the path integral formulation considers the probability of a trajectory or path in terms of its action. So what are two things that you can say or more about the probability density?"
"Friedman","00;46;41;18","00;47;24;03","What are two complementary ways that it can be expressed? What are important similarities and differences between this fork or plank formalism to approach and the path integral formulation of formalism? Three Are there other complementary ways to say it or other ways to say what is here? But this is just to introduce what's going to be very important and going to be moved back and forth in the course of this paper, which is one representation that's more field like continuum like, and then another representation that's going to be more trajectory and path based what do you see in there?"
"McKean","00;47;26;15","00;48;15;00","Yeah, we we discussed this briefly about you know, like a continuous space versus a kind of discrete or instantaneous space, like there's some mostly I guess metaphor there analogy. But when you just ask this question of what are other ways to see this, it's it's some reaction trajectory. Their path is like a sounds like like a like an action density or an energy density, like where the where is the kind of path of of the energy and the whole system going to events itself."
"McKean","00;48;15;00","00;48;18;17","Right. So it's it's like an action density gradient or something like this. Right?"
"McKean","00;48;24;00","00;48;26;12","Yeah. Cool. Really interesting."
"Friedman","00;48;28;04","00;48;56;03","Both the fork or plank and the path integral formulations, the formalism, 23 dialectic inherit their functional form from assumptions about the statistics of random fluctuations in one. So recall one with the flow and the random fluctuation term, for example, the most likely path or path of least action is the path taken when the fluctuations take their most likely value of zero."
"Friedman","00;48;57;00","00;49;25;13","So we're going to explore this more but the path of least action is not using action in the same way that active states are. Exactly path of least action does not mean the laziest or the least energetically costly or the least mobile thing to do. It's not that it is. So that is what we're going to explore what does it mean to minimize action in this framework?"
"Friedman","00;49;26;20","00;49;52;11","The motion on the path of least action is just the flow without random fluctuations. So if the question where you're trying to run in a straight line forward, there's two forces there's the flow of you running forward, and then there's your thermal vibrations. So in one limit, the flow might absolutely be overwhelming. The random fluctuation of least action would be that person running forward."
"Friedman","00;49;53;10","00;50;25;10","Conversely, if that person was like the size of one molecule, they would be being buffeted by stochastic thermal vibration. And so they would not be following that path of least action. In the same way this metaphor hopefully doesn't misrepresent, but paths of least action will figure prominently in the following sections of the paper, especially when considering systems that behave in a precise or predictable way, we will denote the most likely states and paths with a bold typeface."
"Friedman","00;50;26;02","00;50;54;26","So it can be a little subtle sometimes and so we'll try to clarify annotation and get assistance as we can. But like this is like a bold x, like a bold x 30 is the minimization of that unbounded function with respect to the action a of those states through time and that is going to be related to the change in extra time being just only the flow."
"Friedman","00;50;55;22","00;51;23;19","So here it was like x dot of T equals the flow of X plus a noise term. Here, if the noise term is zero, you can drop it and then they write other equivalents, the fork or plank and the path integral formalisms this dialectic that we've discussed, the formalisms provide complementary perspectives on dynamics. Did we mention that they're different but complimentary?"
"Friedman","00;51;24;18","00;51;59;06","The former deals with time dependent probability densities overstates the latter path integral considers time independent densities over paths the density overstates at a particular time is a time marginal of the density over trajectories. These probabilities Bayesian probabilities, Bayesian statistics can be conveniently quantified in terms of their negative logarithms or potentials leading to surprise and action respectively. So we'll explore the formalisms more."
"Friedman","00;51;59;15","00;52;29;15","But just to note that the fancy I the fracture I is the joint distribution and it is going to be a negative log on the joint distribution. P And then similarly a the action is going to be on those same variables in a slightly different way, being looking like a surprise conditioned upon x sub zero, the starting conditions."
"Friedman","00;52;30;14","00;52;42;26","And we're going to go into more detail in the coming weeks any more comments on Section two or will continue to three no."
"McKean","00;52;43;01","00;52;44;21","Yeah, that's awesome."
"Friedman","00;52;46;13","00;53;16;04","Section three Solutions Study States and on equilibrium so far. So Sections one and two, we have equations that describe the relationship between the dynamics of a system and probability densities over fluctuations, states and their paths. This is sufficient to elaborate most physics big if true here's where, for example, we could use the Focker plank or the path integral formalism."
"Friedman","00;53;16;04","00;54;18;25","So either side of that dialectic to derive quantum mechanics where the Focker plank becomes the Schrodinger wave equation mechanics one quantum we could focus on systems that comprise statistical ensembles of similar states to derive stochastic and statistical mechanics in terms of fluctuation theorems, statistical mechanics, mechanics. Number two, finally, we could consider large systems in which the fluctuations are averaged a way to derive classical mechanics, such as electromagnetism and data that general relativity, classical mechanics, mechanics, number three, all of these mechanics, quantum statistical classical require boundary conditions to give the examples the Schrodinger potential in quantum mechanics, the heat, bath or reservoir in statistical mechanics, and the classical potential for Lagrangian classical mechanics."
"Friedman","00;54;19;27","00;55;01;07","At this point, the AP steps back. I wonder what space it's in and asks Where do these boundary conditions come from? Indeed, this was implicit in Schrodinger's question in the famous article What is life in 1944 where Schrodinger wrote How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism via accounted for by physics and chemistry and this is a bit of a nod slash reference to the paper of Rammstein at all in 2018 answering Schrodinger's question a free energy formalization formulation."
"Friedman","00;55;01;12","00;55;21;19","So this was a really impactful and relevant paper that started a discussion around the FFP and multi scale FFP and self-organizing complex biological systems. And so on. So anything to add about these mechanics and their similarities and differences."
"McKean","00;55;23;28","00;55;33;13","Markup like it's obviously what they're they're everywhere when you find it's a."
"Friedman","00;55;35;09","00;56;15;18","In formalism six, we're going to go into it hopefully in the discussions but just in livestream number 32 on stochastic chaos in markup blankets just to show where these similar equations were represented, we talked about how the Helmholtz decomposition could be used to take a field and decompose it into multiple sections. There's the divergence term, which is like or the gradient term, which is like you're on some landscape and the ruler that's the most angled just going straight up the hill."
"Friedman","00;56;16;05","00;56;48;08","That's like the divergence term, and that might be useful for going up or down a hill as fast as possible. Then there's this solenoid or control flow term, and that is like an ISO contour. And those two are part of the classical Helmholtz decomposition line. And then there's this capital Lambda, which is the housekeeping term, as it was referred to in 32, and we explored it a bit, but it reflects the way that that landscape is also influenced by movement."
"Friedman","00;56;48;14","00;57;19;17","So we wondered if that was like kind of like walking around on a trampoline where you can't just snapshot the topographical map and then do your navigation on the fixed map. But there's some change there. We'll come back to that later. So that's section three on solution study states and on equilibrium. Now we're going to really get to Markoff like blankets, particles, partitions and things in Section four."
"Friedman","00;57;20;16","00;57;23;24","All right. So what do you see in FIG. one?"
"McKean","00;57;29;13","00;58;03;05","Yeah, I mean, see these two inner red and green conditioned on each other that keep these external and internal states on the outside separate. They still have conditional relationship between like the sensory states, the external states and the active states, the internal states. But not with directly with each other. Right."
"Friedman","00;58;03;20","00;58;31;24","So awesome. So they wrote in the caption, it's an influence diagram I believe it's also fairly to say it's a base graph, but we're thinking of the arrows as influence and the nodes like the circles as variables it's a particular partition of states. Particular is a pun because it's it's one specific partitioning is not the only partitioning, but it's a particular one that we're sharing with you."
"Friedman","00;58;32;07","00;59;09;12","And it's partitioning that into a particle into something that's like distinguish the figure from ground. And the four states that get partitioned are internal states and external states that are separated by a Markov blanket comprised of the sensory and active states there's a lot that could be said and we're going to continue to explore. But just to give a few more notes, the partitioning entails that all of these states come into existence in a model specific way at the same time."
"Friedman","00;59;09;22","00;59;43;20","So it's not like there's some feature of the world that just is fundamentally an internal state it's the relationship between an internal and external state, conditioned on a blanket by which all of those assignments can be made it's like an incomplete sentence to have one referenced without the other also, we have the names of the states MEU for internal and ETA for external, and it's kind of like they almost look like flips of each other then."
"Friedman","00;59;43;26","01;00;14;03","As for sensory states, incoming info a for action, active states, outgoing actions. So if it's an external as sensory, a active and mute internal states, and then there's a few couples of states, sets of states that we are going to care about and the equations that describe them have super different implications. So one set of states that's interesting to compare together is the blanket states."
"Friedman","01;00;14;04","01;00;51;29","B is the set of S and A and that's more aligned with the purple 1988 formulation of the Markov blanket or boundary where it was an undirected blanket and first in and others have developed this notion of like a two way partitioning. So the blanket is the set of both S and A, the particular states apply not to be confused with PI the policy selection in the MVP, the particular states are B and MEU, so the blanket and MEU."
"Friedman","01;00;52;13","01;01;19;24","So the particular states are internal, active and sensory everything except for external. So the particle is like the cell, the boundary and the internal generative model. And then there's the autonomous states alpha, which is just a and MEU. And one way to think about those states are like if you were to design the system, those are the states that you can control."
"Friedman","01;01;20;16","01;02;05;09","You can't directly control the sensory input, which is the only thing that differentiates the autonomous from the particular states. You can't directly control what photons hit the retina, but you could control your interpretation and your action for where your eyes move, which might absolutely influence which photons do hit the retina. But the autonomous states are the ones that there's a degree of agency over in a way that is slightly different from just the consideration of the blankets and the internal states let's continue to talk about some of the formalism the conditional independence which are going to be up."
"Friedman","01;02;06;02","01;02;40;11","Let's pull back one more in associating some of these equations of motion with a unique non equilibrium, steady state or ness density. We have a somewhat special setup in which the influences entailed by the equations of motions place constraints on the conditional independence of the mass density these conditional independence, these can be used to identify a particular partition of states into external, sensory, active and internal states, as shown in the figure this is an important move in what space?"
"Friedman","01;02;40;28","01;03;15;12","Because it separates the states of a particle internal states and their sensory and active states the particular states from the remaining external states. To do this, we have to establish how the causal dynamics in one underwrite conditional in dependencies. This can be done simply by using the curvature or second derivative of surprisingly as follows So how is the second derivative of surprise related to causal sparse dynamics in your own words?"
"Friedman","01;03;15;21","01;03;46;29","What is the formal description of a markup like it? What's this sort of minimal Markov blanket? This is a slide from Livestream 26 on Bayesian mechanics. This is like an undirected blanket. We don't have s and a separated just be intermediating and partitioning making MU and ETA conditionally independent. And what about the first in blankets type with sense and action separated what about nested markup blankets and so on and so on."
"Friedman","01;03;47;15","01;04;28;03","But just to look at seven, we basically have x u and v x sub u and x sub v are conditionally independent conditioned upon b the blanket dotted are the dot fancy. I surprise d squared of surprise partial derivative second derivative of surprise dotted at the dot equals zero. What does it mean? How is the second derivative of surprise related to causal dynamics and the partitioning but continuing with a sparse coupling notion?"
"Friedman","01;04;29;07","01;05;02;25","Sparse coupling means that any two states are conditionally independent if one state does not influence the other tautology. Number five This is an important observation, namely that sparse coupling implies the non equilibrium steady state density with conditional independence is in turn. This means any dynamical influence graph with absence or directed edges admits a market blanket. So if your variables are all connected to each other, it's a fully connected social network."
"Friedman","01;05;03;01","01;05;29;10","It's a fully connected statistical model. Then I guess you could argue it has a blanket with respect to some other things that you didn't model or you could get into that whole question. But within that model, there are no blanket partitions to make. If there are any absent edges, then there are some states which, upon knowing them, make some other states conditionally independent."
"Friedman","01;05;31;28","01;05;59;05","They give some more technical details and then they raise a question in the footnote Why does the particular partition comprise four sets of states we'll talk about that in that one continuing on sparse coupling and formulas or not, we can define sparse coupling as a solution to this equation in which all the terms are identically zero. So what terms are zero?"
"Friedman","01;05;59;29","01;06;25;05","What is the reading of this equation? Meaning under what situations are they zero? Are they being measured and said to be estimated at zero? Are they being dictated to be zero? So what terms are zero what does that mean in nine? Sparse coupling means the jacobian coupling states you and V is zero. So on either side of the blanket is zero."
"Friedman","01;06;26;21","01;06;57;19","Look in seven U and V there are on there on either side of the blanket conditioned upon that blanket existing. I i.e. there's an absence of direct coupling from one of those to the other. This definition precludes solenoid or coupling with you. That depends on V because H and gamma are positive. Definite sparse coupling requires associated elements of a solar tidal operator and the Haitian to vanish at every point in state space, which in turn implies conditional independence."
"Friedman","01;06;58;09","01;07;37;08","So what is being shown here? But just to give one more visual way of looking at it, this was figure eight from Livestream 32, and we had basically six variables that were in two clusters of three and they were like two communicating entities. And so they were being coupled by this like one to four connection. And so up here on the top left, there's strong coupling within nodes one, two and three and then there's strong coupling within this clique of four or five and six."
"Friedman","01;07;37;29","01;08;18;21","And then there was a sparse coupling between the systems with a 14, and there was also somewhat of a sparse coupling within the click because they're not all block squares. So we'll return to this. And this again on the theme of how is sparse coupling related to the particular partition and the Bayesian mechanics for particular systems they give some more formalisms in L1 about blankets and couplings and flow we'll go into it later and 13 is very informative."
"Friedman","01;08;19;26","01;08;49;10","The normal form means that particular partitions can be defined in terms of sparse couplings perhaps the simplest definition that guarantees a Markoff blanket is as follows External states only influence sensory states and internal states only influence active states. This means that sensory states are not influenced by internal states and active states are not influenced by external states."
"Friedman","01;08;51;12","01;09;30;28","Here's formalism 13. So recall it's an external sensory, a active mu internal. So f is the flow and omega is going to be the noise and the subscript in something is here like tagging it to be about that variable. So we have the rates of change through time. Here's like a vector or tuple. This vector is describing the four states and it's how external sense action and internal states are changing function of time."
"Friedman","01;09;31;26","01;10;00;19","This just like Formula One is going to be unpacked where we had x sort of t equals flow plus noise. Here we're doing like four of those in parallel. And so it's like external states changing through time is a flow on external states as a function of external sense and action plus the noise of external states is a function of time."
"Friedman","01;10;01;19","01;10;47;05","So sense and external states are a function of external sense and action states plus accompanied noise terms, whereas action and internal states are functions of sense, action and internal states. And so it's like external and sensory states are not being caused by internal states. That's the only missing guy here. Mew it looks like NSA. It's not its ETA essay conversely, the autonomous states, the ones that we have more agency over the odd one out the missing, you know the the dog that's not barking is ETA."
"Friedman","01;10;48;07","01;11;24;22","So these autonomous states are flows on sense action blankets and internal states. So the bottom two rows are the autonomous states and those are defined as flows of particular states, functions of flow flows that are using the particular variables, whereas the external in sense are driven by external facing variables. How would you read that under the sparse coupling?"
"Friedman","01;11;24;22","01;11;49;00","It's simple to show that paths show that not only our internal and external states conditionally independent, but their paths, our conditional independence given that path integral formulation. OK, any thoughts on these last few yeah."
"McKean","01;11;49;00","01;12;41;11","Again, I just feel like whether the math is landing for people and this separation of the internal states, the beam, the, the internal flows being conditioned on the so the atomic states like it's also it's just partially like tautological or just just makes sense in the simple the way the models present it a couple slides back. I'm not sure if I guess this is the right spot to bring it up, but thinking also about just so like I think a question that I have frequently about this is like where do they come from?"
"McKean","01;12;41;18","01;13;04;14","Where do things come from? Well, they come from, you know, the separation and conditioning of particular from the background of the blanket forming out of blankets form, etc. or whereas. What's the difference between the internal stay? The externally? Like you said, if there is this giant social graph, it's all everything's connected, they're all connected, then then there's no markup."
"McKean","01;13;04;14","01;14;20;24","Blankets to like two cells in the body. How do they know that they're not you know, they both have their own markup blankets and yet they are both like external states that are indistinguishable from kind of the rest of stuff to themselves. Right. For for each of them. Right. So like over time that, you know, dissipates like and so, yeah, I just I guess I wonder like the over time documentation here, like how that the dynamics of how something becomes an internal internal state or an external states, how that exactly happens because it just seems like when you look at a lot of examples on, you know, our and tropic physics, you know, anthropic like"
"McKean","01;14;21;25","01;14;54;21","state where we're like everything is good for us and everything we can observe, right? It's like galaxies or something. Oh, they're so far away. They don't you know, there's a lot of intergalactic in space that's not affecting it's very external provided a few billion years like lots of interaction, lots of markup blankets. So it's like, you know, like where does that begin and end?"
"McKean","01;14;54;21","01;14;55;00","Yeah."
"Friedman","01;14;56;09","01;14;57;29","Oh, Markoff. Where our testing."
"McKean","01;14;59;11","01;14;59;18","Yeah."
"Friedman","01;15;01;10","01;15;47;12","Formalism 14 and 15 are further details on the entropy of internal and external paths and the conditional independence is a paths that's going to conclude section for particles, partitions and things, which was about the mark of blanket partitioning of particles, particular states and so on. We'll move pretty quickly through the following sections. Section five from self-organization to self evidencing, equipped with a particular partition, we can now talk about things in terms of their internal states and markup boundary, namely autonomous states, and we can talk about particles, particular states."
"Friedman","01;15;48;25","01;16;25;19","The next step is to characterize the flow of the autonomous states in relation to external states. In other words, considering the nature of a coupling between the outside and inside of the particle across its mark a blanket, it is at this point that we move towards a Bayesian mechanics that is the special provenance of systems with particular partitions the existence of a particular partition means that given sensory states, one can define the conditional density over external states as being parameterized by the most likely internal state."
"Friedman","01;16;26;04","01;17;07;18","And we had several discussions in Livestream 26 on Bayesian mechanics with Lance de Costa this is where variational inference is going to come into play. We will call this a variational density parameter ized by the internal note. Q The distribution we control of internal states, mue about external states. ETA is defined as P of external states conditioned on since equation 16 means that for every sensory state there's a conditional density over external states and a corresponding internal mode with the smallest surprise."
"Friedman","01;17;07;18","01;17;37;01","While this mode specifies the variational density where by definition the scale divergence between the variational density and the conditional density over external states is zero more formalisms more details inducing the variation density is an important move. It means that for every sensory state there is a corresponding active mode and an internal mode. This mode does not mean style."
"Friedman","01;17;37;02","01;18;10;04","Here, mode means like the most common value in a statistical distribution the active and internal modes constitute active and internal manifolds. We will see later that these manifolds play the role of central manifolds namely manifolds that contain paths that do not diverge or converge exponentially. The opposite of exponential. The internal manifold is also a statistical manifold because it is equipped with a metric and implicit information geometry."
"Friedman","01;18;11;08","01;18;42;12","This is because movements on the internal statistical manifold changes the variational density. This is moving towards that dual information geometry perspective. What is equation 17 showing? We're looking at the flows because if we're interested in those paths of least action, we can discount that fluctuation term the expectation of the fluctuations is zero, so we're able to drop those omegas with a subscript that we saw in 13."
"Friedman","01;18;43;10","01;19;22;16","So now we're going to be looking at the flows on different states. As for the top two, the external and the set states, those are going to be about surprise fracture. I fancy I for action and internal states, the autonomous states that is re energy minimizing surprise about external and sensory states minimizing free energy about autonomous states what is that?"
"Friedman","01;19;22;16","01;19;54;23","F The free energy in question is an upper bound on the surprise of particular states. So in variational Bayesian methods, elbow and free energy are used to bound. The surprise while here were bounding surprise or on a particular partitioning including action to model the action perception loop. So we've seen variation on free energy several times. What do these different rearrangements mean?"
"Friedman","01;19;55;27","01;20;17;14","What other rearrangements or restatements of F are possible they give a few thoughts here anything you want to add on Variational three Energy. Knowing that we'll have a lot of time to go into it. That's why I just bring it up. That's what Formalism is. 17, 18. Bring us to."
"McKean","01;20;18;06","01;21;23;02","Yeah, back to the past. And a goal like it's I'm wondering my, my question is in relation to action and energy in the way this institute stated like what yeah. What is, what is the like action version of this. That's what is like the easy to miss like oh, it's just energy thing but is in the way of like framing this here because are not super like so yeah that's my question is just differentiating that or better defining which parts are action, which parts are the energy components of that?"
"McKean","01;21;23;23","01;21;28;26","That's what I would be interested in rearranging. We're thinking about these equations."
"Friedman","01;21;29;26","01;22;01;26","Cool. They write in footnote 19 is variation free energy the same kind of free energy found in thermodynamics like gives free energy perhaps the answer is no. This entropy is distinct from the thermodynamic entropy of internal states. We're going to return to this in the half are we talking about thermal free energy, or are we seeing equations that look like descriptors of thermal entropy?"
"Friedman","01;22;01;26","01;22;44;08","But we're applying them in an informational setting? We'll return to it as they had brought it before. One can formulate this along the lines of a center manifold theorem where we have a fast flow towards a center manifold and a slow flow on the manifold going fast towards the valley ravine and then going slow on the river. This decomposition can be derived simply using a Taylor expansion, Taylor Series expansion around the time varying autonomous mode so here is a Taylor Series expansion."
"Friedman","01;22;44;27","01;23;17;06","It's evaluating a function at a given point, usually zero, and then taking its first derivative and then taking its second derivative and using higher and higher derivatives to approximate increasing distance is from the reference single points where that function was actually evaluated. So how is the Taylor Series expansion or other power series expansions related to time varying autonomous modes?"
"Friedman","01;23;18;11","01;24;01;22","What about that flow on the center manifold we know from 17 that the flow of autonomous mode can be expressed in terms of free energy gradients. Those are the two Fs on the autonomous arm. So this expression 20 unpacks the manifold flow in terms of accuracy and complexity. Parts of free energy where the accuracy part depends on the sensory states, and the complexity part is a function of and only of autonomous states the manifold will look as if it is trying to maximize the accuracy of its predictions while complying with prior Bayesian beliefs."
"Friedman","01;24;02;27","01;24;36;25","Bayesian statistics. These are all Bayesian variables here. Predictions are read as expected, sensory states under posterior Bayesian beliefs about their causes, namely variational density over external states. The real temperature out there in the room, hidden unobserved, external state, thermometer reading, sensory state, and then states some sort of cognitive mirror or representation as models of temperature that's conditioned upon the thermometer reading."
"Friedman","01;24;37;20","01;24;52;10","But there's some generalized synchrony across that thermometer blanket in footnote 21, they write question do particles minimize surprise or free energy?"
"Friedman","01;24;54;17","01;25;28;24","And we'll go into it because they say minimization implies a teleology that goes beyond any claim of the app, whence teleology. I thought we were talking about Teleology earlier. So how deep in the desert are we? What, what, what level of mirage are we engaging in? But we'll get there. And that takes us to figure two, which is going to show two components of autonomous flow conditioned upon sensory states."
"Friedman","01;25;29;20","01;26;15;24","So all of us away we can talk more about the technical details, like how it relies on the Taylor expansion. But here are the autonomous states and the black line potentially can be read as like that manifold attractor and so there's a movement towards directly towards the attractor and then there's a movements that is perhaps orthogonal east, keeping in mind the difference between the gradient and the solenoid oil flow."
"Friedman","01;26;16;23","01;27;02;13","And together route time. So this is not just like a hill previously. Like in 26 we saw like the hill and the particle makes its way to the top of the hill as a function of gradient ascents and solenoid or coupling flow. Here, we're not just ascending a hill like we're tracking this moving point through time, but we're converging in this spiral way and then we can maybe unpack that in relationship to manifold flow and how even if this black line is the manifold, then how is the entity staying on the manifold so we'll talk more about figure two now."
"Friedman","01;27;02;13","01;27;27;13","They're going to summarize this section. A particular partition of non equilibrium steady state ness density implies the autonomous dynamics can be interpreted as performing inference particular kind. It's not doing every kind, it's doing a specific kind and it's a particle. There's the fast flow towards the center manifold and the slow flow on manifold. The manifold flow can be interpreted as Bayesian belief."
"Friedman","01;27;27;13","01;27;57;14","Updating and post. Here, space and beliefs are encoded by points on the internal states, statistical manifold. In other words, for every point on the statistical manifold that synchronization manifold, there's a corresponding variational density or Bayesian belief over external states. These are internal states about external states conditioned on the particular partitioning, and that can now be expressed as the variational principle of least action."
"Friedman","01;27;58;04","01;28;32;21","This is the basis of the step but simply but not to simply. I guess it means that the internal states of a particular partition can be cast as encoding conditional or posterior Bayes and beliefs about external states this license is a poetic description of self-organization, a self evidencing will unpack it later. Just wanted to mention it so we can continue in figure three different ways in which this self evidencing is connected to various theories."
"Friedman","01;28;33;29","01;29;11;26","For example, value, surprise, entropy and model evidence and the schematic is illustrating how minimizing variation of free energy weight. But I thought that minimization implies a teleology that goes beyond any claim of the FSP but minimizing variation of free energy relates to normative theories of optimal behavior like value maximization pragmatic reinforcement reward learning Pavlov Surprise Novelty Info Gain Info Max is the free energy principle here, isn't it?"
"Friedman","01;29;11;26","01;29;47;26","Like all of them entropy and model evidence as well? And then just to conclude the section they ask, Is it tenable to interpret gradient flows on variation free energy landscapes as variational inference? Or is this just teleological window dressing the next section addresses this question through the lens of Bayesian filtering. In brief, we will see that autonomous paths of least action implied by our particular partition are the path of least action of a Bayesian filter."
"Friedman","01;29;49;15","01;30;35;24","This takes us beyond as if arguments by establishing a formal connection between particular dynamics and variational inference. So to discuss what our particular dynamics what is variational inference? What is the relationship between particular dynamics and variational inference? What would it mean for it to be as if and what would it mean for it to be something different then as if OK, continuing on six Lagrangian generalized states and Bayesian filtering now say we want it to emulate or simulate active inference what if?"
"Friedman","01;30;36;00","01;30;37;04","What if that were the case?"
"Friedman","01;30;39;13","01;31;12;28","We could find the stationary solution to the Fokker Planck equation and the accompanying Helmholtz decomposition. We could then solve number 21 called paths of least action that characterize the expected behavior of this kind of particle. However, there is a simpler way to recover the path of least action by finding a path that minimizes LeBron Sheehan at every point in time, noting from three that the path integral of the Lagrangian is the action first, they're going to reintroduce generalized coordinates of motion."
"Friedman","01;31;13;20","01;31;34;25","So we talked about that in number 26 as well, but the generalized coordinates of motion are like the position velocity acceleration and higher and higher and higher derivatives of the coordinates of location so it's taking like the x y coordinates and adding the first derivative and their second derivative and their third derivative and just having that in a vector."
"Friedman","01;31;35;08","01;32;08;28","So that's what's shown here. Extra time, the derivative of x x prime is a flow, the second trip, the first derivative and so on. That's the integrator chain's control and so on in the generalized coordinates of motion, state velocity, acceleration and so on are treated as separate generalized states that are coupled through the jacobian. So if the first and the second are related to each other in the second and third and third, the fourth, there's a sparse coupling in that vector."
"Friedman","01;32;10;02","01;32;46;07","This allows us to relax certain assumptions and gives a quadratic form we'll unpack this more, but there's a Spark City and a capacity to do modeling of movement in the generalized coordinates of motion. Now, maybe three, maybe six are sufficient, but this is like an infinite dimensional framework. But it may be the case that you can go super far with like just a few formalisms 23 and 24."
"Friedman","01;32;47;08","01;33;17;23","Describe that and can be read as a mass matrix. That would be interesting to know what is meant there. And there's a suggestion that precise particles with low amplitude, random fluctuations behave like massive bodies. So that's like the baseball on the, the parabola, the air fluctuations and the thermal vibrations are not dominating its trajectory. But the one molecule baseball it is getting tossed and turned in equation 25 and 26."
"Friedman","01;33;19;03","01;34;02;13","They continue describing using that Helmholtz decomposition, the divergence free flow and the curl free flow. In terms of the gradient descent on integration that'll be helpful to learn what they mean. And then crucially when that is minimized, the mode of the path becomes the path of the mode that would be something useful to understand what is meant. What's the difference between tracking the mean and tracking the mode for Gaussian distributions like the Laplace approximation or any other second order curvature?"
"Friedman","01;34;03;22","01;35;12;09","What does that mean? And then just to close this section, the generalized free energy is easy to evaluate. Thankfully, given a generative model in the form of a state space model, here it is F of sense action and internal is going to be some terms that we'll learn about. And finally, one can simulate active inference by replacing the generalized flow of autonomous states with a generalized Bayesian filter so here we have 27 very similar except notice that there's a lot more arrows and the bottom two instead of 13 we now have these bottom two rows with the D on A and the D on U and some triangles have been introduced we'll unpack more what"
"Friedman","01;35;12;09","01;35;16;14","that means. Any thoughts or comments or we'll continue to seven."
"McKean","01;35;19;02","01;35;20;07","So you can."
"Friedman","01;35;21;17","01;35;49;29","Sevenths from statistical to classical particles. So far we have a busy mechanics that would be apt to describe a particle or person with pullback attractor. But what is the difference between a particle and a person this speaks to distant classes of things to which FFP could apply molecular versus biological versus here we associate biotic self-organization with precise and predictable dynamics of large particles."
"Friedman","01;35;50;17","01;36;18;18","So as we described earlier, if we were talking about classical mechanics, something bigger would be more resistant to like thermal fluctuation. We could think about like that analogy to mass in the statistical setting, where are the priors? Like massive. And they're just on their own inertia and they're not being buffeted by stochastic city versus where is it a lightweight, something that is getting buffeted."
"Friedman","01;36;20;00","01;36;53;28","So here's going to be a distinction between statistical and classical mechanics in the setting of the particular partition it is often said that the AP explains why biological systems resist the second law tendency towards disorder and the natural tendency to dissipation in disorder. However, this is disingenuous on two counts. So is first in 2013 disingenuous or is that paper combating the disingenuous first?"
"Friedman","01;36;53;28","01;37;34;29","The second law applies only to close systems, while the free energy principle describes open systems in which internal states are exposed to an exchange with external states through blanket states of lots unpack there. What exactly is the exchange? Is it like an informational exchange or are like nutrients crossing and becoming incorporated into the internal states in seconds? There is nothing so far to suggest that the entropy of particular states or of paths is small so this is like the design language for particular states that might be totally buffeted by stochastic city or totally on the list."
"Friedman","01;37;34;29","01;38;06;11","Action Railroad and everything in between. But nothing has been said to identify one or the other. And so everything high and low entropy densities. So there's, you know, two particles in two different rooms. One particle is equally traveling to all parts of the room. The other particle is staying in one part of the room. So one of them has a very ordered distribution of space, and the other one has a very like disordered, you know, equilibrium equilibrium gas flowing throughout the room."
"Friedman","01;38;07;15","01;38;43;17","Both of them are particles. So what distinguishes between high and low entropy systems, e.g. between candle flames and concierges respectively, 28, we could have had a concierge and that is going to describe that and we'll come back to it. This suggests that precise particles such as you and me respond to environmental flows and fluctuations in a precise and predictable fashion."
"Friedman","01;38;44;10","01;39;17;16","Well, I'm an unpredictable guy. Yes. In our regime, of attention, it is almost like tuned to some maximally confusing or uninformative things. Or we could have some cognitive experience of being confused but someone's blood sugar through time has more predictability than zero. So it's on that continuum from totally buffeted to totally on the railroad tracks. And it's more like the railroad tracks if you want to survive or design high reliability systems."
"Friedman","01;39;18;20","01;40;07;10","And then they're going to introduce figures four or five and six. Four is about the difference between generic and precise particles. Using an information diagram for precise particles, there's no uncertainty about autonomous states given sensory states, knowledge about action, knowledge about internal states like metacognition, is the behavior of precise particles sufficient for sensing behavior? Perhaps? Figure five The implicit computational architecture used in simulations of sentient behavior and six is reproducing an example from the act and literature with action and action observation so figure four has to do with information gain and sharing with generic and precise particles."
"Friedman","01;40;08;26","01;40;50;23","Do you want to add anything? Otherwise, we'll just take one look at each of four or five and six. OK. Figure five Bayesian Mechanics Graphic Summarizes Belief Updating Implicit ingredient flows on variation of free energy and six Sentient Behavior and action observation. So this is like somebody involved in pointing or tracing or handwriting and also looking at visually in summary, precise particles immersed in an imprecise world respond almost deterministically to external fluctuations why might this behavior be characteristically biological?"
"Friedman","01;40;51;12","01;41;30;15","Precise particles may be the kind of particles that show lifelike or biotic behavior. So let's think of those two particles in the two rooms, one of them 24 hours a day, no matter what the temperature is or what the light dark cycle is, it's always equally covering all parts of the room. The other particle, you find out that when it's light, it stays in this part of the room, and then when it's dark, it stays in this other part of the room, which one of those particles, without knowing anything more, seems more biological, the one that's diffusing like a gas molecule or the one that has this orderly distribution, especially one that's conditioned upon like salience"
"Friedman","01;41;30;15","01;42;25;21","external factors. So the distinction between those imprecise and precise particles getting buffeted by thermal vibrations or being like the classical or like the Kepler universe, like the planets going around orbits totally on buffeted by thermal vibrations rests on the relative contribution of dissipated and conservative flow to their path through state space. One might associate precise particles with living systems with characteristic biorhythms, and then they bring up many, many nested biorhythms from rapid oscillations that are multiple times per seconds in neural systems, heartbeat, respiratory, circadian, seasonal life cycles, even pulling out to the evolutionary angle."
"Friedman","01;42;26;21","01;43;01;04","Turning this on its head, one can argue living systems are a certain kind of particle in virtue of being precise events, conservative dynamics biorhythms and time irreversibility. So, wow, how are these all related to each other? Where does the time irreversibility connect and there summary the emerging picture is that biotic systems feature so an oil flow in virtue of being sufficiently large to average away random fluctuations when core screening their dynamics and figure six explores that more."
"Friedman","01;43;02;06","01;43;33;27","OK, final technical section eight Path Integrals, Planning and Curious Particles. The previous section was focused on linking dynamics changes through time to densities over generalized dates. Internal states can be construed as parameter ising Bayesian beliefs about external states. Internal states are about external states. In this model, in what follows, we move from densities over states to densities over paths to characterize the behavior of particles in terms of their trajectories."
"Friedman","01;43;34;15","01;44;42;24","So formalism 29 we're interested in characterizing autonomous responses to initial particular states, autonomous action and internal states, the ones that we control. Recall that when random fluctuations on the motion of particular states vanish, there's no uncertainty about autonomous paths given external and sensory paths, knowing exactly what to do and exactly what to think. And there's no uncertainty about sensory paths given external and autonomous paths, knowing exactly what sensors will be observed, given the external world and the autonomous paths, which is what one does and thinks if we interpret entropy, is as the limiting density of discrete points figure for then the uncertainty about particular autonomous and sensory paths given external paths become interchangeable formalism, 30"
"Friedman","01;44;43;09","01;45;18;24","formalism, 31 expected free energy the autonomous path with the least expected free energy is the most likely path taken by the autonomous states. Expected free energy. How can we read it? What does it mean? Why does it matter that we're focusing on autonomous states? Autonomous paths, and how is it similar or different from other representations that we've seen and that we will see that did free energy and free energy of the expected future and so on?"
"Friedman","01;45;21;23","01;46;24;04","Expected free energy threats where it can be regarded as a fairly universal objective function for selecting paths of least action planning, planning as Bayesian inference equation. 33 expected free energy expected action, Bayesian optimal decisions utility pragmatic value expectations of information gain optimal info gain Bayes optimal experimental design, optimal hypothesizing. So not just falsification, not to beat a dead horse, but rather than constraining and then executing, keeping this infinite game optimal design perspective open so that we can always be tier of the balance between optimal decision making and optimal experimenting when simulating with active inference and planning afforded by path integral formulation."
"Friedman","01;46;24;04","01;46;49;16","One usually works with discrete state spaces and belief, updating over discrete epochs of time. That's where the partially observable Markov decision process MDP comes into play and plausible policies can then be scored evaluated based upon their expected free energy, and the next action is selected from the most likely policy policies or sequences of actions that can be taken."
"Friedman","01;46;51;07","01;47;17;17","In summary, we now have at hand a way of identifying the most likely autonomous trajectory from any initial particular state that can be used to simulate certainty and behavior of precise particles that we have associated with biotic systems. Expected free energy absorbs two aspects of Bayes optimality into the same objective functional, which is a function with functions. The information gain is optimal."
"Friedman","01;47;17;17","01;47;52;18","Bayesian design Bayesian decision theory is minimizing the cost function under a decision or choice and uncertainty as with the interpretation of variation of free energy, this dual aspect functionality of expected free energy is an interpretation of a single existential imperative to possess a mark, blanket, and implicit thinness teleological. It's worth reflecting upon the differences between the generative models that underwrite variational and expected free energy for V."
"Friedman","01;47;53;12","01;48;35;14","The generative model is a joint density over external and particular states supplied by or supplying the non equilibrium steady state density for the path integral formulation. The generative model is a joint distribution over paths because consequences. The generative model acquires a temporal depth they then have several figures that continue on this theme. Figure seven is related to a de Costa 2020 discrete states, both synthesis paper showing special cases of variational and expected free energy."
"Friedman","01;48;35;29","01;49;02;19","Like when there's no preference there's optimal information gain. When there's no ambiguity, you get pure risk sensitive policy. When there's no intrinsic value, you get expected utility theory. And when there's no ambiguity or preferences in some recent work by Ramstad at all have started to soft reboot the FFP and connectivity principle, which we're going to be looking forward to learning more about."
"Friedman","01;49;03;15","01;49;36;06","Figure eight is a about Bayesian mechanics and active inference, so we can contrast that with Fig. five Bayesian mechanics and active inference. Fig. eight Bayesian Mechanics and Active Inference. FIG. nine is a simulation in which ice skates are occurring, and we can explore this more to the conclusion there are many points of contact between what we described and other theories."
"Friedman","01;49;37;05","01;50;19;12","Please read the papers, discuss special cases. They discuss the mechanics of synchronization, separation of timescale and applications and then in closing, they write about how the developments are speaking to the shift in focus from the foundational issues addressed in this article to their applications, learning and applying active inference and RFP. It is quite possible that the foundational aspects of the free energy principle may also shift as simpler interpretations and perspectives revealed himself that brings us to the end of the day."
"Friedman","01;50;19;14","01;50;24;19","Zero. So, Brock, what would you like to add or say."
"McKean","01;50;33;18","01;51;12;12","I would like to add that for the next zero I will be preparing my answer to this part. First ahead of time. Well, I don't know, just writing down a few things and thinking about intractability and uncertainty and possible kind of informational information, entropy kind of questions that you can ask around that. Like what what makes those kind of ultimate Markov blankets of intractability?"
"McKean","01;51;13;18","01;51;35;06","Like how action intensive is it for information to cross like or for external for the external states to influence the indirectly influence internal states. Right. And another question."
"Friedman","01;51;36;23","01;51;43;26","How hard you have to push on the blanket. What kind of push and what. So, yes, they're conditionally independent, but also they do influence each other."
"McKean","01;51;44;28","01;51;45;04","In."
"Friedman","01;51;45;22","01;51;47;21","The blanket. So how hard do you have to push?"
"McKean","01;51;48;08","01;52;46;10","Yeah, and it just it seems like I guess what I'm saying is that the scale which we kind of you're using the particle people and the baseball analogy, right. Then we talked about that yesterday or the day about like just a large, you know, matrix, large space of states, of variables of, you know, dimensions of, of what you mean by a mark called blanket in a particular, you know, and the scale of that markup when you get to the environment right having like a big seeming to have a like a big impact on how hard you have to push there."
"McKean","01;52;47;03","01;52;57;00","Right the baseballs flying through the air, but the particles spreading out and, you know, being pushed around them. Yeah."
"Friedman","01;52;57;02","01;53;30;18","And I was like, are we little molecules trying to push the baseball or are we the designated hitter who's way over power and able to put it wherever we want? Or are we just doing the tiniest buffeting? Maybe this is a design language that helps us frame both of those settings. And recognize when are we able to be guiding the path of least action and where might, no matter how hard we yell, maybe we're not influencing it like literally at all."
"McKean","01;53;32;00","01;54;13;22","Or sticks, we're influencing like staccato, like stochastic, like it's not we can't kind of concentrate our action into one, you know, path, right? One like so yeah.
