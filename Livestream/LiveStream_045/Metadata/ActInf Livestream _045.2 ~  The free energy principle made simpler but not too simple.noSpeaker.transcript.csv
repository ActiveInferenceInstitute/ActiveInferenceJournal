"Unknown","00;00;28;23","00;00;57;16","Hello. Welcome, everyone. It is active live stream number 45.2. It's June 8th, 2022. Welcome, Carl. And we are having our third discussion on the 45. So welcome to the Active Live, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. This is a recorded and an archival livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;58;06","00;01;25;04","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for livestreams. Head over to active inference dot org to learn more about the live streams and other projects that are happening in active lab. We're in active stream number 45.2. It's the third discussion of the paper. The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple. The first author has joined."
"Unknown","00;01;25;04","00;01;48;26","So thank you very much for that. And we're going to be discussing the paper and related topics. So if you're watching live, feel free to write questions and comments in the live chat and we'll try to address it if it's within the regime of attention. Otherwise, we'll just briefly say hello and then dove in to any number of places."
"Unknown","00;01;49;11","00;02;18;08","So just to begin, we can say hi and we can just mention something we're excited about or something we liked or remembered, or something that we might want to resolve by the end of the discussion. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I think there was one question that was submitted by Brock that I would very much like to get into and also understand the role of mass and inertia for some of these statistical distributions."
"Unknown","00;02;18;21","00;03;00;14","But hi, I'm Blue. I'm a researcher in New Mexico and I have probably 100 million questions, but one one that's been bugging a long time about internal states and sensory states and the influence, whether it's reciprocal or not. So. Okay. And Carl, anything you'd like to begin with or lead off? Well, I'm Carl. And of the free energy principle, this particular one, I have a bit of a focus on curiosity."
"Unknown","00;03;00;14","00;03;22;12","I'm curious to know what you're curious about. So I was just to remember this question and how I would how and how I would provide a clear answer to it. That's what I focus on, answering the questions. Let's start with a question about curiosity and then blue. You can ask the question you had Where is curiosity? In these curious particles?"
"Unknown","00;03;24;01","00;04;02;19","They are technically an expression of curiosity is an expression of the imperative to select those courses of action or policies that yield the greatest information gain. And they are properties of certain particles, not all particles, but certain particles. And interestingly, the kinds of particles that conform or look as if they are behaving in a way to maximize their information, gain or minimize their uncertainty about it."
"Unknown","00;04;02;28","00;04;58;07","States that external to the mark of blanket are those that show very precise dynamics, usually associated with larger particles, things like you and me. So if you work through the physics and the dynamics that particles who preserve that mark of blanket have and make the further assumption that you're looking at a large classical like particle that conforms to classical mechanics, then you can demonstrate that the active states, the way that it acts upon the environment, are the product of beliefs about action that were that rendered the most likely actions, those that maximize information gain."
"Unknown","00;04;58;28","00;05;27;14","So that's that's a technical answer for me. Mathematically, this all fairly straightforward, but I imagine it might be a bit mysterious for if you don't know the underlying math. Okay, great start so blue to your question. So this is something that I've heard many times before. But but since I have the opportunity to interrogate you about it now, I think it's a good chance."
"Unknown","00;05;28;09","00;05;58;11","So here it says Particular partitions can be defined in terms of sparse coupling. Perhaps the simplest definition that guarantees a markov blanket is as follows External states only influence sensory states, and internal states only influence active states. And I find this troubling, and I found it troubling often in the past because I feel like internal states influence sensory states."
"Unknown","00;05;58;27","00;06;26;01","Like especially in the circumstance where someone takes LSD, your sensory states are totally then influenced by your internal like state of what's going on. Like, is this like poking holes in the Markoff blanket or what is happening when the internal states, I feel, have a great ability to influence the senses. Right. I like the notion of poking holes in your mask of blanket."
"Unknown","00;06;26;14","00;06;50;14","That's something you wouldn't really want to do too much if you were that Markoff blanket, because that would basically destroy the Markoff blanket. And interestingly, much of you know, I conceive of much of neuroscience as trying to sort of peer through the bulk of it. And sometimes you do poke holes in Markoff blankets, for example, invasive electrophysiology, for example."
"Unknown","00;06;50;14","00;07;14;13","You actually get inside and look at the internal states. But in answer to your question, which is, I think quite an astute question and those kinds of effects would be mediated technically by what we call active states. So it is certainly possible that you can alter the gain or the sensitivity of your sensory states and your effect, your receptor organs."
"Unknown","00;07;15;17","00;07;43;27","But that effect is mediated by an active state. So if you look again at that sort of influence diagram, the little arrows in it, you will see that there is a vicarious path in which the internal states can have an effect on sometimes a profound effect on the responsiveness or the sensory states per say. But usually what that translates into is the sensitive beauty or the responsiveness of sensory states to external states."
"Unknown","00;07;44;12","00;08;33;04","So in the instance of psychedelics, for example, you might construe that as if the drug was acting at the level of the retina, for example, that might be activating certain active states that are mediating attentional like phenomena at a very, very low level. Probably not the best explanation with psychedelics. You know, I would contend that anything that affects your perception is really something that can be understood as a different kind of belief."
"Unknown","00;08;33;04","00;09;01;02","Updating or perceptual synthesis given the same sensory information. So I'll I'll come back to you and ask, you know, Well, what did you mean by I know that my internal stress can affect my sensory states, and you might. Do you really mean your sensory states? Do you actually mean the rate at which your receptors or your any of your sensory receptors are actually firing?"
"Unknown","00;09;01;12","00;09;33;03","Or did you really mean the sense making that ensues from the same sensory input due to some internal we sometimes call it internal action, but some internal dynamics that change the belief updating and change that kind of thing. Explanation you bring to the table for this particular pattern of sensory input. Yes. And so I think it's I think it's a little bit of both."
"Unknown","00;09;33;03","00;10;01;24","I think especially like I think some of I feel like it's maybe MDMA that affects like the the way that your eyes move and in your head, like literally effects like your the ice skates. So I would think that like, I guess that's involuntary action. So I guess then it does impact the action even though the action is involuntary."
"Unknown","00;10;02;21","00;10;27;19","I guess that makes sense. So I guess I just don't that that makes perfect sense. And notice what you've done is that you've you're talking exclusively about action, you know, help teaching the world. And that obviously underwrites the sense making. But of course, that's not internal states affecting the sensory input. It's affecting the way that we palpate the world and the sensory input that we get."
"Unknown","00;10;28;00","00;11;12;15","And in a sense that that's the one way in which we express our curious behavior, that we actually palpate visually or personally the world with our eyes, with our with us know, sensory receptors in our skin and even orange receptive receptors that mediate those gut feelings. You know, these can all be deployed in particular ways, but these are reflections of acting on and acting on the world in order to produce different kinds of sensations so that you know, that answer, I think so highlights exactly that sparse coupling that underwrites the statistical separation of internal from external states."
"Unknown","00;11;13;17","00;11;46;21","Give me another example. I think they're the ones that are sort of counterintuitive or sort of violations of the most useful to drill down on, you know, to all sort of like, I think of extreme circumstances also not just like psychedelics, but but you know, when you're absolutely parched like so when you're absolutely, absolutely famished. So the food smells so much better when you're absolutely starving."
"Unknown","00;11;47;02","00;12;23;19","So so that's another example of how like my internal states, you know, I feel like effects your sensory perception or that's a great example as well. So I would read that example and it makes a number of excellent points, but certainly the salience of certain sensory cues and different states of being that you yourself infer will be very context dependent."
"Unknown","00;12;23;25","00;12;50;21","So your example is, you know, the food smells nice when you're hungry, but to if you like, articulate that and to realize that and also make plans in terms of what you're going to do about being hungry, or you have to have an internal representation not just of niceness, but also being hungry, you know, to recognize that you are hungry."
"Unknown","00;12;50;21","00;13;22;08","So I think that example almost paradoxically speaks to extremely high level internal states trying to make sense of all of these intercept of cues that are coming in. So that's a nice example of intercept of inference. So in the same way we tried to make sense of the patterns of visual input in terms of what caused that, what's the best explanation of this particular pattern is a face that a bird at very low levels is an edge."
"Unknown","00;13;23;16","00;13;52;05","All those rules in principle should also apply to the patterned inputs you get from your autonomic nervous system, your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, and all the receptors that I repeat literally report your gut feelings and you have to make sense of that. And some of, you know, creatures like you and me can make sense of it by bringing these very high level hypotheses like I am in a state of hunger or I am hungry."
"Unknown","00;13;52;13","00;14;33;15","But this is just another percept, you know, and it's, as you know, has the same status as the percept of a face. You know, a face is a sufficient explanation for what I'm currently seeing enables me to make all sorts of predictions about what's going to happen in terms of, you know, looking at that face and hearing the sounds emanating from that face and knowing that I am hungry also has enormous benefit in the sense that it now constrains or provides or conditions, certain prior beliefs about what I'm likely to do next, including these mental actions that enable me to attend to certain other cues as opposed to other kids."
"Unknown","00;14;33;15","00;14;58;26","And I think it's really the smelling now is part and parcel of that is that you are actually attending to olfactory input. But in order to do that, you've got to recognize that the most likely thing I am likely to do as a hungry creature who knows that she's hungry, is attend to my olfactory input. So the mechanism of attention, interestingly, gets into this later example as well."
"Unknown","00;14;59;27","00;15;25;02","And that's the thing that's a nice observation in the sense that many people think that the that attention is a kind of mental action. It's an internal action. It's sort of basically appealing to this notion of mark of for the mark of blankets within the brain and certain high levels acting upon the lower levels just to set the gain."
"Unknown","00;15;25;10","00;16;04;20","You know, and if you're taking a particular coding strikes with the precision of certain signals and psychology rhetoric, this would be the salience of your of of particular certain modalities of input that that whole precise information for you at that point in time, that resolve uncertainty about the state that you're in, hungry, happy, fearful, whatever. You know, all of these things have to be inferred and recognized by the blink updating of the dynamics of the internal states."
"Unknown","00;16;05;25","00;16;41;05","I could first welcome Thomas greetings. Talk a little bit about action and how action integrates these complex nested chains of causal narratives. So we talked about different perturbations, whether it's a pharmacological intervention or some optogenetics or something like that. There could be modification at the level of the retina, and that's directly modifying the sense states. So there we don't need to appeal to any internal states changing to change perceptions like you're seeing something different."
"Unknown","00;16;41;05","00;17;08;06","When there's different light on the retina, then, as was mentioned, there might be modification of active states of ocular motor behavior. And then, Karl, you just brought it to the idea of attention as a mental action. And so looking back at the the partitioning in this figure, the particular states are the internal states mu and the blanket. So that's the whole particle as it moves around."
"Unknown","00;17;08;14","00;17;37;22","That's the entity as distinguished from the environments. But there's special attention paid to the autonomous states, which are the active states and the internal states. And it's almost like these are the ones where control can be applied either in this terms of direct ocular motor action or the the possibility of attention as mental action. And so sense cannot be directly controlled."
"Unknown","00;17;38;04","00;18;07;10","But in this strange loop way is what uncertainty is being reduced about, which is the outcomes of the observations. And so distinguishing these different subsets of the partitions like the particular states being the entity, the particle, and then the autonomous states being the ones that have special control, degrees of freedom and the blanket states being the ones that intermediate or make the internal and external states conditionally independent."
"Unknown","00;18;07;24","00;18;40;17","Each of these subsets and maybe even other subsets have special roles in understanding different cognitive informal phenomena like curiosity or drive and motivation and so on. And then also the example with the food, I am hungry. And then I thought about what if someone had the belief I am fasting and that food smells good, but it would not be pleasant if my fast were ruined by this sensory outcome."
"Unknown","00;18;41;02","00;19;25;16","So there's even degrees of cognitive action beyond and impulsively following drives that are of one sensory mode. Thomas Would you like to say hi or remark on anything you're seeing here or anywhere else or there's some questions in the chat. And so as of last time, I apologize. I'm a bit late joining run over a little bit of the hospital so lots of things on the slide that that certainly I'm interested in thinking about the roles of attention and and and and you mention the word salience as well."
"Unknown","00;19;26;23","00;20;00;24","And I guess the thing I might pick up on is that I in relation to that, the idea that attention can be a form of action and is that we can think about we can think about the things that are saving as interesting, things that are worthy of attending to, worthy of and performing that action that then obtains those data, which I can't quite a useful way of thinking about the relationship between those two terms and a way of understanding what we mean when we talk about salience or attention."
"Unknown","00;20;00;24","00;20;34;27","There's some things and and to me, this is one of the big motivations for and using computational neuroscience methods, using mathematical modeling as a way of trying to describe what's going on in that a lot of these terms are used interchangeably and the very different meanings by different authors in a lot of the cognitive sciences. And it's quite useful to be able to pin that down to something mathematical and unambiguous that that says what I'm talking about is let's use the same words, something, something different, but at least we can be clear on what is meant by it here."
"Unknown","00;20;35;26","00;21;03;10","So for me, it's one of the things that I found got me interested in active inference in the first place. This idea of being able to formalize things in in psychology in a very precise way. It makes me think of pinning insects. And sometimes by just pinning a few parts of them, the whole pose might be stabilized. And then other times you might pin this bug and somebody else says, Well, I have this one that's floating around."
"Unknown","00;21;04;22","00;21;43;28","It could be pin down or just trying to walk this path between being clear about how the terms are used, but not partitioning ourself off and saying, Well, we're ignoring the casual use of the English words, surprise or belief or curiosity or attention or salience. And we're just going to call that string onto this other formalism. So how to navigate the way that sometimes the formal isms do have words that tag them like risk or ambiguity and how to be clear about something."
"Unknown","00;21;43;28","00;22;28;20","Yet when the term itself may not have sharp distinctions, maybe a lot is cut out or is not fully encompassed by that definition. And it has issues with then people taking an unrelated issue or definition of that word and projecting that back onto the formalism. Yes. And as you say, I think it ends with translation to the question of degree as well is not just shutting itself off with one specific definition that's different to everybody else, since it's a way of saying, how can we how can we actually relate all these things together and see if there are multiple different terms that are used that apply to the same underlying construct?"
"Unknown","00;22;30;17","00;23;01;13","Lou, would you like to ask anything or I can go to a question in the chat. Go ahead. Let's go to the chat. Okay. I'm going to ask one shorter question while preparing another longer one. So Ali asks, how can seemingly irrational, non optimal behavior in some organisms be accounted for in active inference, different types of non optimal or seemingly irrational behavior, whether altruism or making mistakes?"
"Unknown","00;23;01;28","00;23;47;19","How can these behaviors be understood within a behavioral optimality framework? Did you have any thoughts on that one? First, I'm thinking about balls rolling to the bottom of balls. One could say, I don't like where this ball rolled or I wish things had been different so it wouldn't have rolled that way. But given where the ball starts and the structure of the landscape, it's just playing out a certain way."
"Unknown","00;23;47;19","00;24;28;27","So if somebody has a very strong aversion to risk, maybe even with the total accurate information, they could still make a decision where the outcomes are post-hoc perceived as suboptimal due to an extreme attention being paid to the possibility of a downside. A 1% chance you lose $1, but there's a 99% chance that you get $100. But if you're paying a lot of attention to that 1% chance of loss, maybe that causes somebody to not engage in this offer, that in the mean field or in this sort of other way or other set of priors, other attention would be quite relevant."
"Unknown","00;24;28;27","00;25;08;05","So given how things are set up, they play out a certain way and we don't need to take that too much onto the determinism path. But given a set of priors, Bayes optimal or variational Bayes utilizing organisms or those remodel as such may get two outcomes that don't always result in them achieving their even specified goals, but I think about it in terms of the old expression if you want to go fast, go alone, and if you want to go far, go together."
"Unknown","00;25;08;05","00;25;46;17","It's about cooperation and really in the effort of achieving any goal, I think that the altruistic behavior in terms of cooperation, well, it's not always really seen that way. I think overall it is that way. So, I mean, while giving $10 to a homeless person in your community might be, you know, depriving you of $10, it's also giving that person the opportunity to, you know, have a meal or whatever it just is."
"Unknown","00;25;46;17","00;26;12;23","It's in our nature to be cooperative, whether it's going to directly benefit us or not, because it's only through things like cooperation that we can build rocket ships and, you know, be sitting here today discussing this paper so we wouldn't have witnesses like the Internet if we didn't. Instinctive cooperate, regardless whether it directly benefits us or not. Great point about the scale mattering."
"Unknown","00;26;13;09","00;26;36;11","Zoom in. Why is that lever? So giving up all the glucose isn't glucose something important or pragmatic value for that cell? And it can be true and it can be playing a service at a higher level. So Thomas or Carl, I was just going to pick up on your analogy, your metaphor with the balls rolling into the different bowls."
"Unknown","00;26;37;06","00;27;01;28","And I thought that was quite a nice way of putting it in the sense that the optimum trajectory of a ball rolling into a bowl, if for any given bowl, is effectively going to be the most likely path it takes. Now, of course, you could you could swap that bowl for bowl of a completely different shape and you would get a completely different trajectory."
"Unknown","00;27;02;06","00;27;32;16","So what might seem optimal is the trajectory for one bowl might seem completely suboptimal for another. And there's a question that comes up here a lot in terms of thinking about psychopathology or disease processes, where people say, well, how is it that you can describe that as engaging in optimal behavior? Because clearly what's happening is so far not suppose the answer is that's your referencing optimality with reference to the wrong bowl and you need to think about what is the objective function."
"Unknown","00;27;32;16","00;27;55;20","Whenever we're talking about optimality, we need to say, what? What is it we're measuring optimality in relation to an act of inference predicted. The objective function is always going to be a free energy functional, but the specific priors that are going to making up that energy function will have a big impact on the shape of the energy landscape and therefore where we're going to end up moving the kind of trajectories we're going to have."
"Unknown","00;27;55;20","00;28;31;25","And so it turns around the question of saying is something Osborne says, given that it is optimal, what is the appropriate objective function defined in terms of the appropriate primes? Thank you, Carl. Okay. Yes. Just to reinforce all of those answers and provide a succinct way of responding to this important question, what is the relationship between active inference and bounded or optimal behavior?"
"Unknown","00;28;32;08","00;29;14;11","So one way to answer that question is just to query the nature of optimal behavior and bounded rationality, as it's usually defined in behavioral economics and sometimes in sort of behavioral psychology. And one theorem which brings those kinds of formulation into question is called the complete plus theorem. And what that says is that for any pair of lost functions and behaviors that exists, a set of priors that render that behavior Bayes optimal."
"Unknown","00;29;15;00","00;30;02;13","So to translate that into the current conversation, what that means is active inference can describe any behavior in terms of Bayes optimality given any lost functions if you allow for different priors. So what that tells you is that the notion of sub optimality is itself a little bit suspect. All you're saying is that there are unique priors that explain this behavior and what you normally end up realizing is that Bayes optimality, in the general sense of active inference, is not a way of prescribing optimal behavior, it's a way of describing it."
"Unknown","00;30;03;01","00;30;33;17","And that description requires an identification of specification of the prize in the generative model, which is effectively what Thomas has just said, and indeed practical applications of active inference to say in the context of computational psychiatry are just that they are just using active inference in order to summarize or to understand or characterize a particular person in terms of the prior beliefs they are bringing to the table."
"Unknown","00;30;33;26","00;31;10;04","Given the behavior and given that they're sensory states and usually using some kind of economics game. So I think the key thing here is that the principles that underwrite active inference are there to describe, not to prescribe, just in the same sense that Hamilton's principles, principle of action, will describe how a ball travels through the air or a massive body or the or the the bull in the in the bowl that you were just discussing."
"Unknown","00;31;10;13","00;31;36;18","And it does not prescribe optimal behavior until you specify the shape of the particular prize at hand, which will be or are by definition different for every particle, every creature and every person. So there is no optimality in the sense that there is a right way to behave. It's always conditioned on the prior beliefs of the person that you're talking to."
"Unknown","00;31;36;18","00;32;12;00","There's a further twist here which moves on from expected utility theory, and I'd also suggest bounded rationality, which is that the the objective function that underwrites choice, behavior and planning has two aspects to it. It's got the expected information gain and the expected cost or the negative expected utility. But the expected information gain depends upon what you currently believe, which means that the optimal way to behave depends upon what you believe in this moment."
"Unknown","00;32;12;10","00;32;40;25","So there is no, if you like, invariant optimal response because it's always conditioned upon what you know at the moment. So there may be times when you behave in a way that seems to ignore your prior preferences in order to resolve some uncertainty. And there'll be other times when that will be less. The uncertainty would be less, if you like, potent in determining what the best next thing or the most likely thing you're going to do next."
"Unknown","00;32;41;08","00;33;17;22","So I think active inference gracefully subsumes bounded and optimal behavior. But as special cases when you can ignore the way that we handle uncertainty, awesome. And it makes me think of even in the fully observable chessboard situation, there still might not be a single best move. And so situations with less observability and more openness in their affordances, it's even more that case."
"Unknown","00;33;18;05","00;33;49;02","So it's great how you mentioned, Karl, about the description rather than the proscription, and that is followed nicely by a question from chat. So I a Roland Rodriguez asked for Austin has said the free energy principle describes particular existence. Maxwell Ramstad says storms do not follow FFP while water does. I deduce then that for FIP the stone exists but the storm does not."
"Unknown","00;33;49;19","00;34;25;11","Is that accurate or otherwise? Can anything be said to exist that is not able to be described by the FIP? So if FIP is about describing rather than proscribing what can be described with the fip, that's a difficult question. I'm tempted to get Thomas to answer. I give him a starter while he's gathering his thoughts. So yeah, Friston has says FIP."
"Unknown","00;34;25;15","00;35;10;21","I think probably Rumsfeld talks about they talk about storms or stones. Interestingly, storms are somewhat difficult to describe because defining the mark of blanket of a storm is not quite so easy as defining mark of nugget of a stone. So I'm going to assume that we're talking about stones as opposed to storms. And so the answer would be the FIP applies to anything where a thing is defined, stipulated in terms of possessing a mark of blanket that enables you to distinguish the states that belong to the thing from any other states."
"Unknown","00;35;11;02","00;35;37;16","So if something exists, then the fip applies does. So that's, that's one thing that can be said very, very clearly. The next question is, well, are there different kinds of things? And the answer would be yes, absolutely. And it depends very much upon the causal diagrams. We're looking at the influence diagrams that we were looking at before in terms of the sparsity of what influences what."
"Unknown","00;35;38;03","00;36;19;12","So Stones may be construed as a as mark of blankets that don't have any overt active states. So they could be construed as inert. Things that were inert things could be described as mark of blankets or possessing a particular partition, which is another way of saying it possesses a mark of blanket. And you have you can distinguish it from a stone from the in which the stone is found, but that particular kind of particle or mark of blanket is inert in the sense it doesn't move around very much."
"Unknown","00;36;20;00","00;36;51;08","If it doesn't move around at all in an autonomous way. So that immediately distinguishes between two kinds of particles with or without active states. You can go on sort of defining different sparse structures and different kinds of things. And until we get back to the and then you mentioned strange loops before, and there is certainly an interesting, strange loop that emerges when when one's active states."
"Unknown","00;36;51;08","00;37;24;22","So one's actions are hidden from the internal states. And what does that mean? Well, it means that now my active states become causes of my sensations. But I don't know that. Therefore, now, because I am or I could read my internal dynamics as belief updating about my the causes of my sensations, I now can be read as forming beliefs about the causes of sensations that include my own actions."
"Unknown","00;37;25;02","00;37;55;07","And at this point, you have a mathematical image of planning that you move from things like thermostats and viruses through to people and, you know, anything that has a sufficiently deep or expressive generative model to cover its own action. So now you get into the world of the kinds of things that look as if they engage in and in planning."
"Unknown","00;37;55;07","00;38;17;27","And sometimes that's framed in terms of planning as inference. And that would be that would be an apt way to describe a lot of the you know, a lot of the biological self-organization we are interested in, but not all of it. You are you content the virus doesn't plan. You could even contend that a different scan evolution doesn't plan."
"Unknown","00;38;18;03","00;38;48;16","So not everything plans. But there will be certain kinds of things mark of blankets, particular partitions that look as if they do plan. Thomas Turn I don't know quite what his words to that. I suppose an alternative perspective on the question or more accurately, an alternative question is which systems that useful to try to describe with that energy principle."
"Unknown","00;38;49;12","00;39;19;12","And I think what Karl's described in terms of some of the special cases, the things that, you know, is it useful to describe a stone in terms of energy principle? Almost certainly not. And you sort of add any additional additional baggage and things, but it's not really doing any inference of an interesting sort. And perhaps best way of answering that question is to look at the sorts of things that the energy principle has been applied to and have found some sort of purchase."
"Unknown","00;39;19;12","00;39;53;21","Clearly looking at and looking at the cognitive neuroscience response and where it's a particular impact. And and I would imagine that part of the reason for that is that what's so interesting about brains and behavior is that what goes on inside a brain is, is and almost by definition is only interesting because it is something that relates to what's going on outside of that brain, to the whole business of doing neuroscience is about relating internal and external states in the way in which we relate to one another."
"Unknown","00;39;54;16","00;40;54;11","And so it's only once you once you start looking at systems like that that you really need to appeal to this kind of formalism. Right. So just a few notes on this. Are you mentioned different kinds of things and what taxonomies or classification schemes of things exist along? What dimensions do things exist and how does the FP bring cohesion or highlight tensions in the ways that kinds of things have been identified, like mental versus physical constructs, or just a few that were were mentioned different extent of seemingly cognitive states."
"Unknown","00;40;55;17","00;41;43;25","Then you mentioned the difference of the extent of the autonomous action. And then I think what the question and it was clarified a bit in the chat about the storm and the stone was about resistance to dissipation, resistance in its persistence. So where do dissipative persistent its regenerative propagate if cascading failing systems, its growing systems, what, what how do we think of those as different types of things or dynamically?"
"Unknown","00;41;44;19","00;42;08;23","It all boils down to the functional form of the dynamics. So from from the point of view that we had a principle, I should say, that, you know, this is a very colloquial view which is just emerging. You over the past few years and indeed of the past few weeks. So this is not accepted. We're still not receiving consensus about it."
"Unknown","00;42;08;23","00;42;38;05","But if you want to announce the form first principles, then you start where the free energy principle starts, which is in the dynamics. And the dynamics are defined by a stochastic differential equation, sometimes known as a random dynamical system in physics. This is just thing at the launch of an equation. And so any different kind of system and implicitly, if there is a thing in the system, then there has to be a particular partition."
"Unknown","00;42;38;23","00;43;08;26","That's something which is at the heart of the Fibonacci principle. It's a defining thing that's in terms of the ability to separate states of the thing from other states. So by definition we're talking about Markov blankets. And as soon as you write down a particular partition that implies or requires a blanket, then you have the opportunity now to look at the functional form of the influences of different states and other states."
"Unknown","00;43;08;26","00;44;04;11","And then you can now, if you like, knock out further causal all currencies to create a taxonomy of increasing stars, fitting of systems and ask questions. What sorts of behaviors would these more and more sparse systems demonstrate? And one nice example that we've just been discussing is if we cut the connection in the functional form of the coupling among the subset, so the partition between the active states and the internal states, so that now the active states, my action now becomes hidden from the internal states because it's been uncoupled, then it becomes a hidden cause of my sensations and I get a very different kind of interpretation of the internal balance in terms of belief"
"Unknown","00;44;04;11","00;44;49;13","updating. So that's one nice example of what would emerge just by thinking about things in terms of the dynamical architecture, namely the functional form of the dynamical coupling between different different, different subsets of things. You also introduced a very important another distinction. So that would be, if you like, one dimension along which you would be able to elaborate different kinds of things, different classes of things, different categories of things of increasing sparsity and probably in the increase in the sparsity increasing sophistication and you know, more closer to things like us basically, you know, the sparse you get."
"Unknown","00;44;50;09","00;45;25;16","But because you will get to, you know, to to and things that show autonomous behavior of of an intentional kind has this planning aspect but there's another crucial distinction which you refer to, which is the distinction between particular states that are dissipative versus conservative. Now, in this instance, for all things that exist for a given period of time, then the mark of blanket has to be there because that definitionally specifies the existence of the things."
"Unknown","00;45;25;22","00;46;21;11","That's an existential imperative. But within that non dissipating mark of blanket, you can have particular states, namely autonomous, internal and active plus sensory states that belong to big things. And that's important because with big things, all the random fluctuations that do the thermodynamic dissipation are averaged away and they start to behave like classical objects. So you have this distinction between small things whose internal states and sensory states and active states could show lots of random fluctuations, possibly even down to the quantum level versus big things like you and me that actually obey almost locomotion mechanics, classical mechanics, Newton's laws of motion, for example, or electrodynamics, terms of the behavior of neuronal populations and the like."
"Unknown","00;46;22;00","00;47;05;24","So these classical dynamics are subject to exactly the same rules and principles that underwrite the periphery energy principle. But in this special case, all of the internal, active and sensory paths dynamics are path of least action because you've averaged away, because you of course grained to an extent that there are no more random fluctuations. And that creates a very different kind of behavior that, you know, again, moves us into the realm of creatures that plan basically simply because they have this precise kind of dynamics."
"Unknown","00;47;06;01","00;47;27;21","So in summary, from the point of view of just the math, I think the taxonomy you're looking for, which I don't think is actually out there yet, but could be in the fullness of time, just said the reason I don't think it's quite out there is if you look at physics up until now, no one's really got beyond just saying there exists a heat bath or a skirting, a potential or a heat reservoir."
"Unknown","00;47;28;14","00;47;53;23","So they haven't really thought about apart, you know, a partition into a heat bath. The thing that's by the heat bath and the thing that contains the heap of which is the external states. So there isn't really a mechanics that really talks about things in this explicit way, which is one reason I suspect there isn't actually at this stage a physics of different kinds of things."
"Unknown","00;47;53;23","00;48;28;14","But if that if there is, my guess is it would be articulated in terms of the sparse coupling among partitions of a particular subsets of a particular partition and whether or not certain subsets or that dynamics are subject to non-trivial random fluctuations and uncertainty. Awesome. Well, apparently we all expect and prefer such a taxonomy, so people can probably guess how that will influence our future policy selection."
"Unknown","00;48;29;11","00;48;55;03","It also takes us to a question that Brock had raised in the week between the one of the two so broadcast. I'm interested in how Markov blankets interact and affect one another, specifically when their scales differ by many orders of magnitude. For example, baseball versus the air molecules, DNA in a cell nucleus versus the environment. Alpha particles DNA."
"Unknown","00;48;55;25","00;49;22;17","It sometimes seems the larger scale overwhelms the smaller scale and vice versa, conditioned on some particular timescale. I'm wondering if we're considering the Markov blanket as it's Markov chain into the past and future, if that relative scale is taken into account. Some things shorter or longer, Markov chains that could possibly explain the seeming flip flopping of direction of effects in their relative mass scales."
"Unknown","00;49;23;07","00;50;16;02","Or is there some generalized synthesis of action slash free energy that considers both of these and others to explain the direction of effects? So how do dynamically, potentially dynamically changing boundaries and multi-scale systems come together to help us understand cascading top down or bottom up effects, what Belushi does about from the point of view of evolution. Okay, here would be one thought and a precursor non FP perspective on this is Energetics, the version of Hermann Hakan 1983 Classic Citation Multi-Scale systems like the Ripple in the Wave."
"Unknown","00;50;16;14","00;50;44;20","Where is it that changing the ripple influences the wave and vice versa as well as Synergetic, which is a more geometric perspective that Bucky Fuller provides. So people have been thinking about what kinds of top down and bottom up effects are causing cascading changes in multiscale systems. And then to bring it to evolution like you suggested, the structure of the system."
"Unknown","00;50;44;20","00;51;22;29","So the system, as received by the current moment, sets up certain affordances for very similar stimuli to propagate through a system in a nonlinear way. So for example, like a pheromones of a given shape might bind to a receptor with high affinity that opens local channels that, makes that neuron fire, and that amplifies. And so that causes a change at the organismal behavior level because of the shape of that perturbation, but then just adding one methyl group or modifying the chemical very slightly."
"Unknown","00;51;23;13","00;52;22;29","So a very similar stimuli or a photon of a wavelength outside of the receptive range of a given visual receptor doesn't induce that kind of a cascading change. So perhaps it could just be said that the structure of the system and maybe even the sparsity of the connection among subunits predisposes it in a given moment to have what appears to be almost exquisite sensitivity for certain kinds of changes, while very similar changes next door may have very little effect and that potentially at a higher level, evolution and through the intra, intra and intergenerational timescales gets to a multi level position where the kinds of stimuli that one wouldn't want to have propagate through the system"
"Unknown","00;52;23;04","00;53;06;26","don't, and the kinds of stimuli that one would want to have propagate through the system do, because that multiscale system is the most responsive and adaptive over multiple timescales. Otherwise there might be something highly sensitive at one scale, but it's at a blind alley at another time scale or vice versa? Yes. Two blue. I instantly thought of evolution as soon as I heard that question and really thinking about where a situation where the particle of larger mass is overwhelmed by a particle of smaller mass."
"Unknown","00;53;06;26","00;53;53;20","I thought about the the sperm cell. So upon fertilization, I think that the particle smaller mass completely overwhelmed the particle of of larger mass, although the blanket of the the sperm cell, I think is then subsumed into the the the mother of the of a baby. But that I was reminded of the paper by Matt Sims that we discussed about counting biological minds and the interaction between Vibrio Fischeri and the squid when the the, I mean, the spin go in and out or the the Rio for Fisher I go in and out of the squid and a very like pretty it seems like very magical daily cycle and composed the light organ or caused the"
"Unknown","00;53;53;20","00;54;19;00","squid to like light up and enable its hunting behavior or facilitate its hunting behavior because then it doesn't cast a shadow over the organisms that it's hunting. And in this situation, it's interesting. It's these nonlinear effects. It's not one little bacteria that can make us fed light up, but it's got to be like a sufficient concentration of bacteria that that caused the lighting up of of the squid."
"Unknown","00;54;20;02","00;54;50;18","And it's like a compounded effect. So here, like the the small mark of blankets of each individual bacterial particle, a really maybe overwhelm the larger system and I don't know I feel that way also about humans the microbiome and the work that we've learned over the last 20 years, ten years maybe about the microbiome and its importance in human behavior."
"Unknown","00;54;51;04","00;55;20;11","The gut brain axis, just overall human function, functionality and toxicity and so forth. So, so I think that that all these small blankets really have have a very important effect and non-linear. But it does seem to take up a quite a mass of them to make an impact."
"Unknown","00;55;23;22","00;55;50;26","Can I just come in on the on that just to pick up on this synchronization of large ensembles of similar kinds of Markoff blankets? I think that's a very important notion. It does strike me that sort of three fundamental issues buried in this question, this sort of ensembles of Markoff blankets, and then there's the link between different scales."
"Unknown","00;55;50;26","00;56;32;16","So Markoff blankets of Markoff blankets. And then how does this manifest in terms of intuitive concepts like mass? So I just to rehearse what you're what's just been said from distinguishing between ensembles of Markoff blankets at the same scale, then you now have a mathematical image of multicellular organization through to eco niche construction, through to cult culture, aspects of evolutionary psychology in terms of lots of people interacting together."
"Unknown","00;56;32;25","00;57;14;20","And this has many, many fascinating aspect. It's the one, if you like, heuristic that I always keep referring to when trying to understand what a free energy like principle would would bring you. Is that because the very shrill free energies and extensive property, it means that the free energy of the ensemble, of a collection of multiple Markoff blankets, all talking to each other or coupled to each other via that blanket states, and is cast as the sum of each individual free of energy."
"Unknown","00;57;14;21","00;57;50;25","And if you just simplify the notion of free energy as predictability, what you're saying is that the the likely state of an ensemble is that in which they've jointly minimized their free energy by making everything mutually predictable. And this normally is manifested as generalized synchronization, which is exactly the sort of, you know, this the behavior of bugs that light up together or birds that flock together."
"Unknown","00;57;51;21","00;58;21;07","So you you see this and you could actually argue that sort of things like language are just one expression of a way to ensure that we're all mutually predictable. And in showing that we are jointly mutually predictable means that jointly we can minimize our free energy. So there are lots of really interesting sort of directions that you can take that notion of what would happen if you put lots of mark of blankets together."
"Unknown","00;58;21;20","00;58;47;19","The other the second thing, which I think speaks more to the evolutionary thing, is the the link between blankets of blankets at different scales. And, you know, we've just heard in the previous answers that this normally entails not only a course, graining moving, if you like, up in terms of the spatial scale, but absolutely crucially at temporal scale."
"Unknown","00;58;47;28","00;59;20;09","And I think that that's absolutely crucial. The fact that the and the mark of blanket at a lower scale is likely to less last for a shorter amount of time than the mark of blanket at the biggest scale. So it's perfectly permissible to apply the free energy principle to mark of blankets that exist for a short period of time, from the point of view of a larger scale, and allow for a metamorphosis, a phase transition and merging a mark of blankets with the sperm and the egg cell."
"Unknown","00;59;21;27","00;59;45;08","But from the point of view of the scale above, this is perfectly permissible. So the free energy principle only applies at the time scale that is associated with the level in question. But now the game is to understand how the mark of blanket or mark of blankets up the scale above couples to the scope below and vice versa."
"Unknown","00;59;45;09","01;00;26;19","And this brings us to all sorts of delicate issues about how you would read evolution and epigenetics as prescribing short that mark of blankets in phenotypic time. For example. It also again speaks to that this fundamental role of the separation of timescales that Daniel was talking about in relation to synergistic know, fast and slow modes. So I think that that kind of thinking about things from a different point of view of a separation of temporal or spatial temporal scales begs some deep questions about top down and bottom up causation."
"Unknown","01;00;26;19","01;01;05;24","That is, if you like, can be articulated in terms of the endurance and mark of blankets at any particular scale. Finally, the mass thing is interesting and it relates very much to the scale. And so mass at a quantum level is usually read as the inverse amplitude of random fluctuations. So if you're looking for the sort of, you know, the intuitive notion of mass as dictating the behavior of a very small particle, the quantum scale, then the, you know, the quantity that underwrites that is the amplitude of the of random fluctuations."
"Unknown","01;01;06;05","01;01;33;13","As things get hotter with more and more random fluctuations, they tend to have they look as if they have smaller mass. But as you get bigger and bigger and bigger and you move into the world of Lagrangian mechanics and classical mechanics and the random fluctuations disappear, then you're in the world now where mass takes on a very different meaning, and it effectively can be regarded as a an active state in the sense that my mass attracts you."
"Unknown","01;01;33;21","01;02;04;19","So I act on you through my mass, attracting you and then you in the world of general relativity and body problems. And I mentioned in body problems because they the anything that makes them interesting is exactly the non-reality is the blue was talking about. So if you didn't have this nonlinearity and this set of nodal flows, underwrite the grandeur mechanics and the orbiting of the heavenly bodies or anything that oscillates, you know, in a classical sense."
"Unknown","01;02;05;00","01;02;34;01","And then then you would not have the itinerant dynamics that are characteristic of non-equilibrium systems that that conform to classical classical mechanics. So just the notion of mass, I think, is itself really very interesting and takes on very, very different meanings mathematically, depending upon whether you're working a very, very small scale or a very large scale. This is kind of a callback to our previous discussion."
"Unknown","01;02;34;17","01;03;11;01","We talked about three generalizations. We talked about generalized synchrony or generalized coordinates of motions and generalized homeostasis. And so I'm actually seeing these reflected in your response and in your trilemma. Carl The ensembles of Markov blankets at the same scale of similar or different kinds of things is a general synchronization. And again, that doesn't mean lockstep. That means it could be turn taking as a generalized mode to allow for this mutual predictability, and that's generalized synchronization."
"Unknown","01;03;11;17","01;03;55;04","And then the second point had to do with the relationship between scales, whether that's accomplished with a renormalization or with some other framework from energetics. And that made me think about the generalized coordinates in space and time and kind of like a GPS coordinates. Not exactly, but it's like a scales of ten in space. And so there's some coordinate systems that help us navigate multiscale, spatial and temporal with this notion that things that are things for short amount of time tend to be smaller, and even things that have large spatial extent and are short lived, the smaller parts of them are even more short lived."
"Unknown","01;03;55;16","01;04;44;09","So it's kind of true within and between different kinds of things. And then this final one I feel like should connect to generalized homeostasis. I was thinking about the orbiting of the planets as a generalized homeostasis in some way, like the nonlinear parity is such that it isn't just collisions and repulsion, but actually there is an attracting set and there's bio rhythms that are predicated upon the generalized synchronization and the generalized coordinate somehow, and that allows for multiscale generalized homeostasis, which is to say persistent multiscale things."
"Unknown","01;04;44;09","01;05;20;05","Let's go to a slightly different and technical question. This is from Mel Dorn, who wrote, say, in our generative model, we have n numbers of possible states s given observation of we would like to estimate p s conditioned upon o equals o using variational inference. What if we needed the n plus first state variable in order to describe the true posterior better similar to thinking out of the box by adding dimensions."
"Unknown","01;05;20;05","01;05;55;02","So partially observable states would mean two things. One, I don't know how many states I need, so I need to be flexible in thinking out of the box for better estimation of P. S conditioned on O and to give an observation. Oh, I am not certain what state I am in. Could you please discuss the idea of flexible, growing and pruning of states s while estimating the true posterior?"
"Unknown","01;05;55;02","01;06;23;05","So this is a question that's come up occasionally over the last few years. And I remember Ryan Smith did some work on exactly this question, specifically on how you might grow the states in your model and so I think it's still an open question as to what the optimal way of adding in new states or new hypotheses is."
"Unknown","01;06;23;05","01;06;52;15","But I think the way of evaluating whether those additional hypotheses are useful is much better established. So the answer to the second part how do you evaluate whether it's useful to have an additional state of the hypothesis as part of the model or not? Is simply to to perform a basic model comparison. Say you calculate the marginal likelihood or a free energy approximation to that when the state is in play and then another one when it's not."
"Unknown","01;06;53;27","01;07;38;10","It's interesting to note that the question highlights both growing and I think pruning was in there as well. And, and that it's interesting that it's much easier to prove in a way than it is to work out how to add in new states. And and we could do that very efficient using methods like Bayesian model reduction, which effectively say let's let's sort of run the model or fit our model when we've got all of our hypotheses in play and then test post-hoc alternative models in which we set the prior probability of certain states to zero or to nearly zero to compare, how much better would our model be without it?"
"Unknown","01;07;39;06","01;08;13;22","And it's better in the sense that we managed to reduce the complexity of the model we're using, simplify things and comply with Ockham's Razor while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in how we predict the data which the accuracy complexity turns to the question of marginal exit or free energy. And so if we had a simple way of adding an additional states, then then it's simply a matter of then calculating with that additional state, is the margin likelihood improved or not?"
"Unknown","01;08;14;18","01;08;36;26","And an alternative ways to say, well, match, let's just take the pruning perspective. Let's just start from a very large number of states and I know the parameter list generative model our world with many hypotheses that we don't plausibly think are going to really be there and then simply put them way in relation to the data we have until we've got the simplest accurate explanation."
"Unknown","01;08;36;29","01;09;23;04","These data, it's very interesting about after a proposal is on the table, whether we're in the Bayesian or we're in the frequentist world, evaluating alternatives can be done with a defined approach, but it is how you get the proposal on to the table. What generates new alternatives. Because the space of model modifications may be like pragmatically or even in principle, open ended, especially if we allow for very complex structural maneuvers like nesting of models that is basically open ended in which proposals are possible."
"Unknown","01;09;23;20","01;09;53;09","However, those may be modeled as actions of some model builder and then they have certain affordances I can add nodes, remove nodes, connect, add a connection, remove a connection, or perform these structural modifications. And then it could be something like a genetic algorithm or some other policy selection approach that results in the space being heuristic or adaptively explored in terms of model structures."
"Unknown","01;09;53;26","01;10;20;13","But it's never going to be as defined of a question as comparing alternatives, because that has a very specific kind of plug and chug basis. Unlike the creativity in the open ended, it's associated with making model changes. Yes. And the point you make about finding a way of the set of operations to build a model is an interesting one as well."
"Unknown","01;10;20;25","01;10;48;17","Sitting at some discussions, it's Giovanni Pazuello as well not long ago and thinking about exactly what sort of operations those might be, whether it be duplicating parts of the model, adding in rock levels or taking away adding in states, taking them away and and and and and how that might manifest in terms of natural selection of models like that and development of cognitive architectures over evolutionary time."
"Unknown","01;10;49;25","01;11;20;29","Cool. We did discuss at least one paper of pazuello at all that was talking about the simple homeostatic architecture and how that could be turned into an a more anticipatory structure and so on. Let's turn back to the road map before we go. As I just mentioned, just three things which people might have heard about, which would be so use related to what you just been discussing."
"Unknown","01;11;20;29","01;11;44;06","The first thing is structure learning in radical constructivism. So the work of people like Josh Tenenbaum and How to Grow a Mind working with this title of one of his popular papers. So this is exactly the problem you've been discussing. What are the rules, the principles for growing models and letting the structure of the model that could include, you know, an and plus one state."
"Unknown","01;11;44;06","01;12;49;23","So that's a very interesting literature. The other probably more technical take on this is called it non Bayes where there are priors used to decide whether to include or not state and plus one given you are currently using just states want to end and they rest things called stick breaking processes like the Chinese restaurant process. So there is a quite a literature out there in terms of struck during the growth of a model, you are usually under the rubric of non parametric Bayes and then finally in economics there is a an ideology that rests upon this distinction between not knowing, having uncertainty about states the world and having uncertainty about states have never been encountered"
"Unknown","01;12;49;23","01;13;22;03","or represented before. And that's sometimes referred to as radical uncertainty. So which is meant to distinguish between just being uncertain about state of affairs, to being knowing that I just don't even know these states could ever happen. So interesting and radical uncertainties, usually used as a motivation for not committing to a probabilistic or Bayesian description of things. So you move into sort of heuristics of the events of sort of narrative explanations for things."
"Unknown","01;13;22;23","01;13;49;28","But I think if you, you know, if you cast radical uncertainty as exactly the kind of problem that you could try to think about principal solutions for, you can probably bring that kind of economic perspective back into into formal math. Just one final point. This relation to the previous question about ensembles, the conclusion that all try to make our worlds as predictable as possible."
"Unknown","01;13;50;09","01;14;17;07","That's sort of suggests you don't need to grow models very much. If the is the case that we construct our own universes in a way to make them predictable, then we actually don't need very complex models. So I wonder whether, in fact the shrinking, the basic model reduction is perfectly fit for purpose and certainly is consistent with with me in the sense that I was born with too many neurons and too many connections."
"Unknown","01;14;17;07","01;14;44;18","And as I get older, I just lose stuff. But at least I become more fit for purpose. Modeling my little world, which you all carefully keep very predictable for me. And thank you all connected to one and casual framework. But in a recent paper with Scott, David and RJ Corday, we we connected Rumsfeld's quatrains, the unknown known, known, unknown."
"Unknown","01;14;45;12","01;15;16;14","And interestingly, in that famous quote by Rumsfeld, if people look at it, he only mentions three of the quadrants and the unknown known is actually like a hidden quadrants. And we sort of, in a preliminary way, asked what, do these different situations mean for different knowledge about particular states? So no known includes the metacognitive aspect of knowing, not all the partition to states, but also the policy."
"Unknown","01;15;17;14","01;15;45;11","And then in the unknown known, the partitions are known. But what is unknown is actually the policy. You got the atom level description of the car, but you still might not know what policy to take in terms of using the car and then knowing unknown is basically the bounded rationality bounded at the perimeter of the particular entity because the internal and blanket states are known as well as potentially even what to do."
"Unknown","01;15;46;00","01;16;11;06","But the external state has high uncertainty. And then this unknown unknown, which is that radical, might include like not knowing what's out there or how to pursue it. And there might be different mappings too. But that was just coming to mind with this question about uncertainty about states. The world is an uncertainty of states that haven't been observed before."
"Unknown","01;16;11;06","01;17;00;02","Let's return to the road map on our road trip. And is there a section that somebody feels like plays well here or a section that we haven't been able to cover any of the figures or formalism of? So I don't think we've covered any of the figures except for figure one. Maybe we want to look into the Figure two autonomous flow."
"Unknown","01;17;00;10","01;17;26;25","Great flow, right? So yes, we did spend a lot of time talking about the particular partition in this discussion and in many other discussions. And it's really important. It's the particular physics, but it would be awesome to just spend a few minutes on each of the subsequent figures. What is being shown? What do the axes or formalism represent and what are the implications of the figure?"
"Unknown","01;17;27;17","01;18;23;02","So here we have Figure two or Carl or Thomas. What is being shown in Figure two two? I suppose there are there are a couple of things being shown in Figure two. And I think that the graphic on the left with the spiral is quite a nice way of demonstrating this idea of there being some solenoid alignment. The flow which is causing it to sort of have this circular structure and that then as a consequence of having the beam and the dissipated part of the flow, this gamma turns the difference between the Q being solenoid lambda, the gamma being the and the dissipative part of this flow."
"Unknown","01;18;23;13","01;18;52;27","And the thought that then reduces the amplitude of this spiral over time and you end up with this settling to some point and so it's just setting out the two different directions really that, that things can evolve then and, and I'm trying to remember exactly what the equations were in the paper that led to that with the expression in terms of that and the alpha and the bold alpha and called may remember that better."
"Unknown","01;18;53;05","01;19;17;00","And it was this at least action path that we were talking about here in terms of the bold alpha, is this threatening to the least action? Yeah. Yeah. And it's an analysis which people might come across when they look at things like the Center Manifolds Theorem or indeed the slaving principle that Diamond was just talking about from Synergetic."
"Unknown","01;19;17;00","01;19;45;11","So you've got this sort of fast fluctuations that are drawn to a center manifold in the last case. The center manifold or the manifold that sort of draws trajectories to it are the path of least action that constitute in the joint space of the external and internal autonomous states. That's synchronization manifold. But in this instance, not synchronization between people, but synchronization to the of the outside."
"Unknown","01;19;45;11","01;20;15;11","Right. And how about the right side and the dark line on the right hand side, which was meant to be the the synchronization manifold to which to which all trajectories are drawn and largely rely upon that synchronization manifold. Any perturbations sort of collapse back to or draw back to the manifold in the spirit of the left hand side of the diagram."
"Unknown","01;20;15;11","01;20;59;20","So, so using like manifold is to emphasize this is very much related to the Center Manifold Theorem. It also speaks to one way of describing generalized synchronization of chaos or generalized synchrony, which is collapse to or constraint constrained flows on a synchronization manifold. So this is just one way graphically illustrating the awesome and the other thoughts on to where's the housekeeping term, the lambda because there's the Q and the gamma."
"Unknown","01;21;00;07","01;21;26;28","But as we've discussed in stream 32, there's another term there to. So I think that the Q and the gamma here are sort of implicitly being treated as constants so that they're not varying state space in particular graphic and instead of the housekeeping turmoil only will only appear with some variation depending upon where you are in state space."
"Unknown","01;21;26;28","01;22;02;01","I mean, in principle you put it back there by allowing those slightly more complicated trajectories with a more interesting sort of nodal flows. I think normally we tend to just assume that the space is defined such that the gamut and can be reached is that tightening or an identity matrix, or at least a blocked open type matrix. Like it's a little bit more complicated when working in generalized coordinates of motion because the construct that the blocks have to account for, that the correlations between different orders of motion."
"Unknown","01;22;02;25","01;22;46;15","So it doesn't necessarily have to vary depending on what you are in space. Awesome. Go. You should feel a license to to ignore the housekeeping term. It must say it's too complicated. Okay, on to three. So three was labeled as markup blankets and self evidencing what is being shown in three. Well I'll. I'll do this briefly then one of you could take over it."
"Unknown","01;22;46;18","01;23;24;14","It was just this slide is usually used to illustrate that the free energy formalism or understanding dynamics as gradient flows on a an energy functional is unremarkable in the sense that it has a lot of construct validity in relation to existing and legacy. Formulations of behavior usually have a normative kind of by normative I just mean that there's some objective function that is being externalized."
"Unknown","01;23;24;20","01;23;57;06","So it's just meant to illustrate that the are this physics like formulation in terms of dynamics and gradient flows on this reality of functional looks and in a position to formalize lots of existing theories and constructs such as reinforcement learning, actual control theory, provided you now read the objective function as a log preference, not the log of your prior."
"Unknown","01;23;57;14","01;24;33;19","That prior preferred states. And you know, I'm just showing that taking different perspectives on normative accounts of behavior is like they're all formally very, very related in the sense example that the negative of value so defined becomes self information. If you're, you know, a sort of if you are not an economist and were an information theorist, you would read the same quantity basically as self informational surprise, a lot surprise."
"Unknown","01;24;33;26","01;25;17;09","And you, you wouldn't talk about which utility theory you talk about maximum efficiency in information theoretic sense. If you are somebody like Hermann Hakan and thinking about synergetic you be taking the average of the self informational and then these dynamics would be basically the thing you are aspiring to understand and describe from the point of view energetics. And if you're a physiologist homeostasis and then of course if you're a statistician or somebody like us who is interested in the in the pure probability theory, then you can interpret the these gradient flows as articulating or at least describing things like the brain hypothesis."
"Unknown","01;25;17;17","01;25;55;21","So it was just an attempt to show that there is just one simple dynamic under the hood of all of these well-accepted, well-proven accounts of the normative behavior. Why is free energy principle in the blue cell? And I think just because it could be described as a principle articulated in terms of information theory, where theory is just a probability theory with some geometry."
"Unknown","01;25;57;02","01;26;09;27","Okay. And while we're on this question of unification, what does the cover of the active inference textbook mean?"
"Unknown","01;26;14;01","01;26;46;19","I'm curious to hear what you think tradition dictates that blue go first. Isn't it like the one ring to bind them, the one ring to find them, and the one ring to rule them all like that. That no, really, I've given really. It's like the Lord of the Rings reference, except like instead of the inscription, there's mass anyway."
"Unknown","01;26;47;19","01;27;21;00","There's, there's the funny take of, of the things I see before we hear two thirds of the answer yes, there's the Lord of the Rings reference and also it's a blankets and it's a particle. And that's the equations that are about partitioning internal from external states. And so that with a minimal amount of text and the minimal number of threes presented mind, brain and behavior power Pazuello and Friston."
"Unknown","01;27;21;00","01;27;55;22","There is the partition column in two minds as to whether we we tell them, I thought that they're like, it's more interesting having these different interpretations. Yeah, okay, I won't push it. Let's go to figure four. But just to say that that mark of truncation, the other three, three threes, that's very clever. I feel also know we didn't realize how clever this is."
"Unknown","01;27;55;22","01;28;19;26","Thomas and Giovanni came up with this, but completing the ring with an X Equals Signs was quite an insight for me at some point. Can you remember that Thomas was like you or Bob and suddenly swatted down the idea of making everything equal to true causality? Yeah. And I think it was Giovanni who actually writes in this equal sign."
"Unknown","01;28;19;26","01;28;56;12","But now we have three other ways of selling this very clever cleverness. Like, Yes, I wish we thought of. Right. Okay. In Figure four, it's describing generic and precise particles. So what are being shown? I'll take this one because I did this one. So this is exactly the trying to depict the distinction we were talking about. Before we ask you about a taxonomy of different kinds of things."
"Unknown","01;28;56;12","01;29;36;05","And I was just saying it's useful to make a distinction between very small quantum scale things and large classical scale things, where the particles are sufficiently large that the the random fluctuations go away, and every particular path is a path of least action. And in this specific case, there are certain sources of uncertainty that disappear, that manifest as a collapse of certain uncertainties and that can be captured using what's called an information diagram."
"Unknown","01;29;36;05","01;30;16;01","So this is an information diagram. And basically you can understand the areas as uncertainty or entropy. And the left hand set of panels is, in the general case, that would be suitable for, you know, very small particles showing the shared and unique information between the between a partition into external sensory and for simplicity, autonomous states have and the areas of intersection can be read as a mutual information."
"Unknown","01;30;17;20","01;30;54;29","So what you can see on on the right hand side of the left hand side is that there is uncertainty still in the game. Even when I have I know everything else. So there is a unique uncertainty associated with every one of the states. But if I now move to precise particles or particles that behave as if they were more classical in nature, there are there are a lot of uncertainty disappears in the sense that the only source of random fluctuations is on the at the path."
"Unknown","01;30;54;29","01;31;31;05","So the dynamics of the external states, which means that if I knew the external and autonomous states, then I would be able to predict precisely the path of least action or the path that a sensory state would take in the absence of any random fluctuations. So the unique uncertainty associated with the sensory states ESP disappears. Similarly, if I knew the external states and the sensory states, then there is no uncertainty about the path of autonomous states."
"Unknown","01;31;31;05","01;32;08;15","So the unique pink part associated with alpha, the autonomous states disappears and that has the interesting that the uncertainty about the both the sensory and active state autonomous states has to be the same. It's the if you knew the external states eternity by etre and other things. So for example, there is no uncertainty about active states given sensory states, which means that the active states on the right hand side have to lie within the sensory states."
"Unknown","01;32;08;15","01;33;02;06","And you may be asking, why is this useful? Well, it becomes incredibly useful when you apply those constraint. It's those things like the uncertainty about both autonomous and sensory states, given external states have to be the same, for example, and that there is no unsaid. The uncertainty about external states, given sensory states, is the same as the uncertainty external states, given both sensory and autonomous states, for example, all of these little sort of like constraints that ensue from the simple move, big from small to big particles, get into an expression for the probability distribution over autonomous parts."
"Unknown","01;33;02;18","01;33;30;20","And it is this these set of constraints that lead to a functional form for the expected free energy which can be decomposed into what we were talking about before, which is expected information gain and the expected cost. In the absence of those constraints, that expected information would disappear. It would all the things would cancel out in the general case."
"Unknown","01;33;31;01","01;34;11;23","So this is, if you like, a map of, you know, a visualize able way of looking at the information decomposition among the part of the particular partition in the context of the general case and in the context of precise case, just to sort of visualize the constraints that lead to curious behavior. So if you remember, it is expected information gain that describes apparent curious behavior because actions become more likely if they increase expected or have a high expected information gain or resolve, uncertainty or minimize entropy of the conditional sort."
"Unknown","01;34;12;19","01;34;45;21","So this is, if you like, an a visual aid memoir or an unpacking of what can be quite dense and unintuitive expressions written out mathematically in terms of information. There is an expected Lagrangian or surprises and neutral informations. I say that for Thomas, his best thinkers would be working on trying to get the simplest way of expressing these important constraints intuitively just using equations."
"Unknown","01;34;45;21","01;35;12;03","And it's not easy. And the reason it's not easy is that in these information diagrams, when there is no uncertainty, when the uncertainty reaches the entropy reaches its lower bound, the area disappears, at which point for discrete systems, the entropy is zero. So when there's no uncertainty areas equal to zero, h the uncertainty. The entropy is equal to zero."
"Unknown","01;35;12;26","01;35;39;18","That's how it should be. The problem is when Shannon wrote down entropy for continuous systems that no longer holds and you get negative areas. So there is no lower bound on the entropy of a continuous and a continuous differential entropy. So you really have to go round the houses to recover an area that disappears when in fact it is bounded by minus infinity."
"Unknown","01;35;39;18","01;36;13;25","So that that particular just was for Thomas. I've just emailed him today about that particular. At the end, Jane saw this problem with Shannon's entropy, you know, decades and decades ago, and try to repair it using something called continuous entropy and the object density of discrete points. So all of that worry and delta always continues to disappear. If you just stick with this, not these nice information diagrams where you know that the if the area isn't there, it's a jump to zero."
"Unknown","01;36;13;25","01;36;57;14","Awesome. It's like you could be 110% sure about something. Let's go to figure five. What is happening in Figure five? I think Figure five is is showing more or less what we've seen on the previous figures, but now just interpreted in the context of in the context of neuroscience, we've got the same action perception graphics we were talking about in FIG. two or the same equations and where the three energies have been interpreted in terms of theories and complexity components."
"Unknown","01;36;58;18","01;37;31;20","So that brings us back to what we talk in terms of interpretation of free energy as a means of estimating model likelihood or approximating model likelihoods and have Bayesian model evidence. And the models should be as simple as possible, while accurately accounting some data. And I think that's really to emphasize less interpretation of self evidence in that we we've spoken about for the idea that by minimizing your free and free energy, you're implicitly maximizing the evidence for some internal model."
"Unknown","01;37;32;15","01;38;17;16","And by putting this explicitly in terms of brain and we now talk about the kind of model that the brain might implicitly hold about the outside world and the kinds of models that might be required. The sentence be appearing behavior. And it got a nice ring to suggest a mock of blanket, but here explicitly many questions for another time about the order of the action perception loop and whether perception precedes action in principle or in different computational implementations."
"Unknown","01;38;17;16","01;38;58;03","How different aspects of the timing of the execution of different stages might converge upon similar outcomes and might not just noting it. In Fig. six, we have sentience, behavior and action observation. So what is shown with the brain and with these three graphics beneath so that this is a nice example of a of what's actually a slightly older version of actual inference now, and it's a slightly different implementation than what we might use."
"Unknown","01;38;58;03","01;39;44;29","But I think it's a nice example in that it highlights the transition from behavior in terms of continuous differential equations through to something that more sequential and behaves in the way that we might actually about plans as being one move and then the next thing after that and an implicit discrimination in time. And and so that the and the plot shown and sort of the upper left where we've got a series of lines which are kind of overlapping red line in bold and exactly that one that is showing what is more or less sort of predator prey like relationship that creates these sort of sequences."
"Unknown","01;39;44;29","01;40;13;19","So if you can imagine that that you have a alternation in a predator and and some sort of prey, whereas the prey population increases in size and that predator population will also increase in size behind that, as the predators have more to feed on, which will in turn cause the prey population to drop, followed again by the predator population dropping as food resources become more scarce."
"Unknown","01;40;14;27","01;40;47;02","And this is known as as efficient air window, less competition, or as a lot more for stereotype dynamic and the generalization of this. You can have many such sequences where one thing follows the other and you get the sequential set of peaks and what's going on here. Now, if we were to interpret each of those lines as representing the probability or the mock probability or some sum and mapping to the probability of one of several alternative discrete states and categorical states."
"Unknown","01;40;47;06","01;41;14;29","So here, imagine we're talking about blue, a blue, green or red, and then we end up generating a sequence of blue screens, reds, depending upon the underlying dynamics. So we have a continuous system that's now has the field of something sequential. And and what's happened here in the graphic on top of the brain here is to associate each of those discrete categories with different points in space."
"Unknown","01;41;15;23","01;41;44;17","So we're now saying this is where if we're looking at the blue points, then that's going to be associated with this sort of upper left location in space or so there's a blue as well, that choice of color to choose my part and, and so each of those sequences is then associated with the generative model that says, I expect that when the blue state is, is present or the red states presence, that my hand will be drawn towards each one of those states."
"Unknown","01;41;44;20","01;42;15;29","I predict that as if there is some sort of spring attached from my hand to where that location is, which means that as I as I infer the sequence, I'm sequentially drawn to where I believe I'm being drawn to each of these locations. Turn now if I'm predicting if my if my free energy or my margin like that says that the most likely states are the ones that would occur if my arm were really being drawn in this direction, the actions that then minimize the free energy are those to fulfill those predictions."
"Unknown","01;42;16;08","01;42;36;14","So all I have to do is predict where the kind of proprioceptive or visual data might get based upon. Where my hand is, is any one point in time and or predict what the data that I would obtain if my hand really were being drawn in this direction, and the resulting action fulfills exactly that and creates the sequence of movements."
"Unknown","01;42;36;24","01;43;03;21","And so what we get out is a relatively complex motor trajectory that has an almost autonomous type feel to it. And simply by predicting that I'm going to be drawn to each of these points in sequence, and this has been used in this particular example as a way of simulating handwriting or something that appears to be like handwriting simply by moving the piece of paper underneath, underneath where my hand is moving so that I end up with this sort of repeated pattern."
"Unknown","01;43;05;00","01;43;26;08","And you could imagine that in real writing, which we made of a series of points that we would associate with different bits of the letters would effectively draw our hand around those letting us be right, cool and categoric all shifts at the letter scale, at the word scale and so on, could be modeled in a, in a hierarchical way, absolute."
"Unknown","01;43;26;17","01;43;56;24","And that that sort of. Exactly to the point in terms of this move from this and this formulation act of inference that used to be used now to explicitly writing down a series of discrete, categorical and as you say, putting that together in a hierarchical model where you can now nix predictions of a discrete, categorical sort with short trajectories in a continuous state, and that continuous state space awesome will complete our lightning tour of the last three figures."
"Unknown","01;43;57;17","01;44;38;21","So here's figure seven. Just for for reference, we looked at figure three, we saw some faces and names and now we're seeing figure seven. What is being shown here. So here I think we're dealing with what what is a limitation of what we saw on the previous slide. And so when we were thinking about these fairly complex trajectories that had an almost autonomous feel like to them, and it's still only a relatively simple sort of behavior implicitly it's just dealing with the replication of some potentially quite complex or even arbitrary pattern."
"Unknown","01;44;40;10","01;45;12;28","But to become really autonomous, to behave in an intelligent way, really what we need is to be able to select between alternative sequences and alternative patterns and what this light is showing, is this idea, this one way, the way that we appear to evaluate different trajectories or the probability of of pursuing these trajectories is in terms of this expected free energy function, which can be decomposed in a similar way to what we expect the free energy function."
"Unknown","01;45;13;05","01;45;48;17","So in blue, the free energy functional being decomposed into our complexity in accuracy terms and various of the decomposition. But in the in the upper panel, we're now looking the decomposition of the expected free energy into into analogous type terms. And we've spoken about some of those already. So if intrinsic value is equivalent to the information gain we were speaking about before, and whereas the extrinsic value is more like an expected utility, the degree to which we prefer a particular outcome."
"Unknown","01;45;49;11","01;46;19;04","And just as on the previous slide, each of the faces relates to different ways that they can be interpreted under specific circumstances, but that there were particular parts of that expression or or don't matter. So in the absence of ambiguity, we end up with behaviors which are entirely risk driven. And so we might get back things like scale control type relations."
"Unknown","01;46;19;04","01;46;51;22","And he notes, or we'll go to a okay, here we are in eight. I thought for a second that we'd seen this before, but it's a subtle reworking of one of the previous figures, isn't it, with them? Here's five with the expected free energy. Yeah, correct. F in five and then just in a path. And now we have an eight G in the top."
"Unknown","01;46;53;02","01;47;24;12","And suppose this is the move that we were talking about before in terms of when the active states are effectively hidden from the internal states and become something that are themselves in third and so you can see added to the absence of any arrow connecting a to the variation free energy box, which is implicitly saying that the action itself is something that we have to draw inferences about and the expected energy is the way in which we can do that."
"Unknown","01;47;24;12","01;48;03;11","It's inference on action about action about the causes of action. Just many ways that have been highlighted for how inference and action are weaving together and different model architectures that might be more didactic IC, more illustrative, more pragmatic for a given context or a given type of thing that has a certain sparsity to its coupling. And to close on FIG. nine and then we can have last thoughts what is shown in Figure nine?"
"Unknown","01;48;03;11","01;48;33;12","Well, so Figure nine is a nice example of the application of this information seeking aspect of the expected free energy and to a task in which there is uncertainty about the orientation of the face that's presented to the active scheme and the alternative trajectories, the alternative parts of autonomous states that can be selected here are the alternative movements or the cuts that can be performed."
"Unknown","01;48;34;18","01;49;15;18","And so choosing the evaluation probability of each the counts depends upon the valuation, the potential information gain associated with those, which is a fact with the information gained, I guess in terms of the eventual orientation of the face. And I think in practice this, if I remember rightly, that this formulation focused very much on the ambiguity term and and I think it's subsequently been updated in various ways, but again, it kind of focused on the the continuous schemes and and provides a nice early example of how information games worked into the to inference type formulations."
"Unknown","01;49;15;18","01;50;00;25","We tend to use practically awesome in our final few minutes, we we look at the questions that we've looked at the end of every live stream and it would be awesome to hear where things go from here, from this recent preprint, from the textbook. What are some of the areas that any of you are interested in or that are now possible to head in?"
"Unknown","01;50;00;25","01;50;36;26","I'll go first then I don't have to go. Last decade, it's a difficult question to answer. There are so many ways you can take this. I think it's become beyond the capacity of any single group or person to really pursue all that all the directions. So nearly every field that we've mentioned is probably the focus of at least one, if not several groups around the world in small embryonic groups, but certainly working earnestly on the different levels of application."
"Unknown","01;50;38;04","01;51;09;12","Technically, what what Thomas and I know that's not quite true. And one thing that Thomas and I have been doing is trying to write the next simpler paper. So, you know, the the friendship principle made simpler, but really wasn't that simple. And they had. So the idea is now to work towards a full page paper that has everything you need to know to understand the free energy principle, the most recent ones down to about of eight pages."
"Unknown","01;51;10;16","01;51;57;20","And what it does is it just drills down on the package formulation and in particular the simplifications afforded by not worrying about non-equilibrium steady state densities and just looking at the densities over paths and just taking away all the unnecessary equations and drilling down what matters. And to me, what really matters is in the last sentence here and implicit in the last figure that you were discussing, which is curiosity, which I think is the key thing that distinguishes current Day II from AGI and to intelligence and understanding and resolving uncertainty about your sense, making understanding of a world and understanding the mathematical imperatives that describe that kind of behavior."
"Unknown","01;51;57;20","01;52;03;13","So this is a I'll end where I started, which is all about curiosity."
"Unknown","01;52;06;05","01;52;31;09","Excellent. Thank you, Thomas. I confess it is a really difficult series of questions to answer and that I think there is always more interesting directions to go in. There is time to pursue them, which is why, again, this concept is important that there are so many groups out there who are taking an interest in focusing in on these issues."
"Unknown","01;52;32;10","01;53;24;22","And certainly the idea of making it simpler, I think, is an important direction to go in and I think is also, to me, one one of the interesting things is, is also thinking about application and the setting of disease processes and trying to understand how and how different disease processes can be framed in terms of alternative priors. And just as a way of, I hope that's important, providing useful clinical characterizations of different kinds of pathology, different kinds of trajectories and different kinds of scientific states, and understanding how different therapeutic options might change the path through some some spaces of prior beliefs of various different temporal and spatial scales, as we spoken about."
"Unknown","01;53;25;15","01;53;54;08","And certainly I think that that's one of the areas I'm particularly interested, seeing things develop. Thank you. Blue. As I was saying the other day, I am really starting to think of active in France the way that like in every in every situation and in every circumstance that I find myself in, I find myself wondering how can I formulate this in an active in France model?"
"Unknown","01;53;54;08","01;54;17;14","And I did the same thing when I was in art school and learning how to draw in a very realistic way. I was learning to draw people and objects in the way that I saw them. And now I'm I'm looking at situations that I find myself in. And, you know, where before I would be in conversation with someone looking their earlobe, like wondering how could I best represent that on a piece of paper?"
