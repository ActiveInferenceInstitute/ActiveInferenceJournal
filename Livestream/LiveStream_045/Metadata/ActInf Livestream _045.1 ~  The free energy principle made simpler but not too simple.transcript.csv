"Speaker 1","00;00;27;00","00;00;54;24","All right. Hello and welcome, everyone. It's active live livestream number 45.1. It's June 1st 2022 Welcome to the Active Lab. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on the slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;55;28","00;01;37;26","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams. Head over to active inference. Talk to find out more about what we're up to at the lab and participate if you'd like to get involved we're here in Livestream number 45.1, and we're in our second discussion around this paper. The Free Energy Principle made simpler but not too simple by first in de Costa, Sajid Hinds also for Pathologists and PAS and the video just like all of them are, is an introduction and an invitation for those who would like to ask questions in the live chat."
"Speaker 1","00;01;37;27","00;02;04;03","For those who would like to join us next week in the conversation And just to try to learn and unpack and understand this paper as well as seeing it as a starting point for the continued learning and applying that we're all involved in and we will just begin with some introductions and overviews, remind ourself where we've been in this paper and then start to think about where we're going and we'll see who joins us."
"Speaker 1","00;02;04;22","00;02;28;11","We'll see who asks questions in the live chat and I guess where we go together so we can begin just by giving an introduction, saying hi and mentioning anything like what's something that we're excited about? What's something that we liked or remembered about the paper and what is something that we're wondering about or would like to resolve towards the end of the discussion?"
"Speaker 1","00;02;28;27","00;02;36;11","So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and I'll answer the questions later. How about you?"
"Speaker 2","00;02;36;11","00;03;18;29","Blue and blue? I'm a researcher in New Mexico. And I don't know why I'm tasked with going first. There's there's a lot of things that I think I would like to have resolved or a greater certainty about, like including the hierarchical nature of active in France and how mathematically that works out, as well as like the time dependance and time independence and I'm curious about like can I don't know, we can get more into it later yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;03;19;22","00;03;19;28","OK."
"Speaker 1","00;03;21;16","00;03;54;12","While people are filing in and getting their questions ready, let's take a look back at the big question, kind of situate ourself in this paper and just recall also what the main sections are in the roadmap so Brock and I worked together on 45.0. And we highlighted the big question, just one way to ask it as what are the foundations of the free energy principle RFP and what does it contribute?"
"Speaker 1","00;03;54;26","00;04;18;23","And then also we can ask how is active inference related to RFP and we drew from the abstract where they mentioned starting from a description of the world in terms of a random dynamical systems and ending up with the description of self-organization as sentient behavior. Greetings, Carl."
"Speaker 1","00;04;22;22","00;04;23;08","How goes it?"
"Speaker 3","00;04;24;02","00;04;29;11","And I've just managed to get back in my house after being locked out by my son. Otherwise, fine."
"Speaker 1","00;04;30;14","00;04;32;12","You found an alternate policy approach."
"Speaker 3","00;04;32;26","00;04;35;29","Yeah, I did. And some keys hiding underneath the bucket."
"Speaker 1","00;04;37;21","00;04;42;00","Would you say this paper is the key to the free energy principle, or what is the key."
"Speaker 3","00;04;45;03","00;04;48;17","This is which one's it's this is the simpler one."
"Speaker 1","00;04;48;24","00;04;51;28","Simple as possible, made simpler but not too simple."
"Speaker 3","00;04;53;02","00;05;03;28","Now, there are simpler ones. I I hope that will be simpler ones so that this is this is one route to the desired simplicity."
"Speaker 1","00;05;05;20","00;05;15;18","All right. So what is this paper about? What did you intend to do and how did you accomplish that in this paper?"
"Speaker 3","00;05;18;23","00;05;51;24","It was originally conceived as a brief summary of the particular physics paper, if you remember that one. That's an archive. We're very dense, hundred page deconstruction of physics as we know it. So this was meant to be a technical rehearsal and focusing specifically on the free energy principle, the active importance part, and was meant to be as simple as you could get it."
"Speaker 3","00;05;51;24","00;05;57;06","But as it was being written, it became more and more complicated so now we're writing another one that's even simpler."
"Speaker 1","00;05;59;16","00;06;05;20","It was a technical rehearsal then. It was a dress rehearsal. And then before you knew it in a short time."
"Speaker 3","00;06;06;13","00;06;06;28","Yes."
"Speaker 1","00;06;09;16","00;06;38;15","Well, there's many places to jump in. But first, thanks so much for joining and feel free to join and leave as works for you. We were interested at the outset with the layout and the roadmap of the paper, so you described how there's the introduction and then the following sections are topically arranged. So how did these seven inner sections come to be?"
"Speaker 1","00;06;38;28","00;06;49;16","Is that the seven islands in the island chain? Are there other topics? How did you come to this order? And these seven sections."
"Speaker 3","00;06;54;12","00;06;55;28","Are you posing the question to me?"
"Speaker 1","00;06;57;01","00;06;59;15","I guess you could go for it, but maybe you could go first."
"Speaker 3","00;07;01;13","00;07;37;12","So I can't see what else is here, so I'm not quite sure who else could speak to this. So from my point of view as the author, it was exactly as you say, it was the stations en route from the basics or the basic assumptions or the prearranged principle, which is basically the launch of an equation, right, right through to the end, which is an account of sentient behavior meant in a very deflationary way."
"Speaker 3","00;07;37;12","00;08;17;10","So it was just the steps that you would need to take to go from the launch description of some system through to, first of all, defining systems of interest that had steady state solutions and then further thinking about the nature of things. That's how you would distinguish a thing from something else and the implications of that distinction as articulated with a mark of blanket for the dynamics and various interpretations of those dynamics."
"Speaker 3","00;08;17;10","00;09;04;03","And of course the interpretation we use is that of self evidencing or gradient flows that look as if they are the kind of gradient flows you would see in systems representing in a Bayesian sense and the causes of their sensory input. Some of them are of blanket and then looking at special classes of types or kinds of particles, and in particular the limiting case of large particles where the random fluctuations on the particular states, namely the mark of blanket, their internal states, tend to zero essentially vanish."
"Speaker 3","00;09;04;03","00;09;41;24","Such such. You are now describing things that have a classical aspect in the sense that they you wouldn't need a sort of microscopic or quantum description that they move and behave in accord with classical Lagrangian dynamics. And that has some special put some special constraints on that. These gradient flows on the ground, as you know, the surprise or that is being read as a gradient flow or sharing the same minima as a gradient flow on variation frequency."
"Speaker 3","00;09;41;24","00;09;54;19","And that takes us then to the final move, which is what that would look like in terms of planning as inference and the articulating that in terms of expected free energy. And then we start."
"Speaker 1","00;09;57;11","00;10;01;10","Awesome blue anything to us or we can continue this line."
"Speaker 2","00;10;03;17","00;10;28;15","You know, I have a question that's like a burning question from reading this paper and listening to Karl talk and then also doing the textbook reading group I'm curious about the language, the causes of sensory inputs. So and I'm curious about this because you can see it in so many ways, and I know that it's open to interpretation and depends upon the model of the system."
"Speaker 2","00;10;28;15","00;10;55;05","But as someone from a neuroscience background, like the cause of my sensory input is like a 450 nanometer light wave or a pressure wave through air in terms in you know, in the sense of sound. So when you think about the cause of the sensory input, like if there's a red balloon and I'm seeing red, like that's, you know, 700 nanometer light wavelength that I'm actually detecting."
"Speaker 2","00;10;55;21","00;11;14;14","But, but then that the balloon is missing from that. And so I just wonder why did you choose term or do you mean it in the literal sense or is it supposed to be obstructive? Am I supposed to come away from the cause of my sense but come away from the red light and go more towards that's a red balloon."
"Speaker 3","00;11;15;22","00;11;26;16","I would come away from the red light and go more towards the red balloon. Would you excuse me for a second? The some that lost me out is this knocking on the door because I stole his key? So how about."
"Speaker 1","00;11;27;09","00;11;34;14","You? Thank you. Move away from the red light. Away from the red light."
"Speaker 3","00;11;37;15","00;12;09;25","Sorry about that. Yeah. No. And so the notion of the use of the language causes is used in a very broad sense in terms of carving up all variables into causes and consequences. So very often when you talk in any modeling context, particularly in terms of the inversion of a generative model, people ask, what do you mean by inversion of a generative model?"
"Speaker 3","00;12;10;07","00;12;51;14","Well, what I mean is a generative model is a probabilistic description of the joint occurrence of causes and consequences. And usually the consequences are observable and the causes are not. So that sometimes referred to as hidden causes so the generated model provides this description of the joint occurrence, probabilistic relationships between causes and consequences. And the way that we or the way that one can understand sensations or sensory samples is as the consequences of some abstract causes."
"Speaker 3","00;12;52;03","00;13;17;14","But because the causes are hidden and or unobservable, they can only be inferred so these causes now become random variables that can only be inferred. So it's from the point of view of a model that the forward model of the generative process would be a map from cause to consequence, but we only have a variable or at hand or on."
"Speaker 3","00;13;17;14","00;13;56;28","I the consequences. So we have to do the reverse mapping, which is the genesis of the notion of model inversion. We have to map from consequences back to causes, and that's basically the process of Bayesian inference. So that's where the language comes from. It's just of spreading the whole universe into two types of variables, causes and consequences. When you move to the free energy principle as articulated in the particular physics paper, things become a little bit more nuanced because now you've got the consequences of external causes impressing themselves on the mark of Plunkett."
"Speaker 3","00;13;57;05","00;14;30;09","But you now also have internal space, internal to the blanket that are now doing the Bayesian modeling version effectively. But the causes are meant as a the universal and very, very high dimensional or referred to a set of very, very high dimensional variables, external states out there that conspire through whole chains of causal links to produce the sensory consequences."
"Speaker 3","00;14;30;23","00;15;09;07","So I would subsume both the red blue and the reflected in the gradient right? And all all of the biophysics that causes a retinal cell to fire that whole chain of causality will entail a whole series and possibly uncountable number of hidden causes in generating the consequences. And you have to work back through that chain and hence the, you know, the, the notion of hierarchical models that explicitly try to put that chain in place at one level of your hierarchical, you have a red balloon and another level of the model."
"Speaker 3","00;15;09;07","00;15;44;00","You might have the the consequences of that red balloon in the outside world, which would be, you know, reflected light and that your passing through your your optical machinery and impinging upon your retina and all that, you know, all of these things will be implicitly modeled or constrained in your generative model so that you can solve the inverse problem, reconstruct the scene out there, given this is how you observed it, because how you observed it is specified in the generative model through a likelihood mapping."
"Speaker 3","00;15;44;00","00;16;22;13","So if I knew the cause a red balloon, you know, what would it what would it feel like? How would I palpate him? What would I observe? And the whole likelihood model would entail all the mechanisms that you describe to the sound waves and pressure waves and and photons and the like. Just to conclude that another common word or phrase people use certainly in machine learning for this notion of causes that are observable, that they are effectively random variables because they are the support of a judge, a model which is specified as a probability distribution is hidden states."
"Speaker 3","00;16;22;23","00;16;51;02","Another word for this is latent states, and I've been told off by some reviewers for using the word latent states, but I can't remember why. So I've I've reverted to this using them exactly the same sense that latent states or hidden states are those unobservable variables that I distinguish between from observable states or outcomes or measurements or data."
"Speaker 3","00;16;52;20","00;16;54;01","So that's where the language comes from."
"Speaker 2","00;16;55;19","00;17;09;08","That's very helpful. Yeah, it's really helps me. This is something that I've struggled with, but to think about it, a hidden cause in terms of a causal chain that leads to that observation that that's a very helpful way for me to think about it. Thank you."
"Speaker 3","00;17;09;23","00;17;10;01","Good."
"Speaker 1","00;17;10;09","00;17;37;09","Yeah. And also how hierarchical vesting of models which we can come back to. It's like one model might be the unobserved is the temperature in the room and the observation is the number on the thermometer, but you don't really see the number, you see the light. So then you could have a two step model where the causes of the temperature or the shape of the thermometer as in the shape of the thermometer is what number it is."
"Speaker 1","00;17;37;09","00;17;57;19","And so depending on how much data and the adequacy that's needed, one could course strain and just say we're going to go from the hidden state to the observed inferred number or can start to parse that if there were degrees of freedom, there let's be the best we."
"Speaker 3","00;17;58;07","00;18;21;13","Can give you those. You could say that's a nice example. You could have a sort of a deep artifact or personal creature with you actually has a representation of temperature as the cause of the shape or the height of the thermometer. Or you could have a very shallow artifact that just registers the height of the thermometer. And I have in mind here the difference in a thermostat and me or you."
"Speaker 3","00;18;21;20","00;18;44;15","So we would know that, you know, we would represent and explain changes in the shape in terms of a change in temperature, because that's our model. And we would have a deep model. The thermostat might not it might directly act upon the world simply because the shape, you know, there are some qualities of single valued scaler, observable that is telling it to switch the radiator on."
"Speaker 3","00;18;44;22","00;19;01;18","So it's a nice distinction. There's no rule which says how how much course grading or how much depth or hierarchical structure you bring to the table in terms of trying to explain what you can observe right."
"Speaker 1","00;19;01;19","00;19;40;16","Let's go to quite early in the discussion in the introduction elsewhere, the tautology in the tautological aspects and the falsification have been explored. So let's jump in to a slightly different point, which is the utility. So there was a rhetoric in the paper. Is such a description of the FP being in this framework or principle like way? And the answer was probably no, but there was a however."
"Speaker 1","00;19;41;01","00;19;52;17","So where do you see the utility of the FP and how does that come into play in the particulars for Turrell or Blue maybe to you first."
"Speaker 3","00;19;53;14","00;19;54;14","Bring us this."
"Speaker 1","00;19;54;20","00;19;57;04","Yes, Blue. Where have you seen utility in the FSP?"
"Speaker 2","00;19;59;28","00;20;52;04","I like that the ACP resolves so many very difficult things to model or maybe it doesn't resolve itself yet, but has the potential to result is maybe a better way to put it, especially in terms of hierarchical modeling. Also the balance between exploration and exploitation, complexity and accuracy. So I think that it's useful to describe circumstances where there's not always a single solution, but but maybe a best solution or how can we find the best solution given what we know OK."
"Speaker 1","00;20;53;05","00;21;13;09","What would you say, Carl? What was the function of this example with the principle of least action, which will also want to explore? But how is there a utility in the FSP? How is there utility in the principle of least action? And what is the relationship between FFP and the principle of least action?"
"Speaker 3","00;21;14;26","00;22;04;11","I think that Blue has provide the answer and it can be illustrated with Hamilton's principle of least principle of inspection. So if I wanted to understand how a ball was thrown or understand its dynamics and its kinetics and its the laws, the physical laws by which a ball or a massive body pursued a particular trajectory, then what I could do is to apply Hamilton's principle of least action to the particulars of this situation, the mass of the ball, the initial conditions, the the wind resistance and everything else that I would need to know in order to predict the behavior and understand the mechanics that underwrote what actually unfolded."
"Speaker 3","00;22;04;26","00;22;38;08","So if you sort of dumb down those aspirations to understand sentient creatures and you know that the distinction or the relationship between exploration and exploitation and just think about understanding the trajectory of massive bodies, what you will end up doing is appealing to a principle of least action. And all that says is these prescribe the the lawful behaviors if you apply that principle to a particular situation."
"Speaker 3","00;22;38;20","00;23;09;03","So for us as builders of sentient artifacts or neuroscientists trying to understand phantom creatures, what it says is that you have a principle at hand that allows you to build. And if you can build that artifact that either resembles or reproduces the kind of behaviors that you interested in studying, then you have a more formal understanding of the mechanics of how those how those artifacts or systems actually operate."
"Speaker 3","00;23;09;07","00;23;46;16","Or you can simulate or you can build artificial intelligence systems that you know, so it's all in the pragmatic building of something by applying the physiology principle to something. And you may be asking, Well, what is that something? Well, it's a generated model. So all the hard work starts not in understanding or defying the free energy principle you know, it's all the hard work is really specifying writing down the generative model, apt to describe the kind of creature you're interested in."
"Speaker 3","00;23;46;21","00;24;24;12","Well, you know, the, the system, the tried to characterize and understand. I'll just close by nodding to or giving a nod to Richard Feynman here because that whole the motivation for application of the principle that in this sense the motivation for the principle in and of itself was just to realize or provide tools for realizing the observation that was famously or purportedly on his blackboard at the time of his death that if you can't build something, you can't create it, you can't understand it."
"Speaker 3","00;24;24;20","00;24;30;18","So to build it is to understand it and vice versa Great."
"Speaker 1","00;24;32;07","00;24;46;20","I'll ask one follow up on Feynman and then we have a great question in the chat. What is Variational inference as Feynman utilized it and as it's utilized in an active right?"
"Speaker 3","00;24;46;20","00;25;19;24","Well, Variational Inference is generally read as a suite of data analytic tools called Variational Bayes that used to always also be called Ensemble Learning. But I haven't heard that phrase in the recent years. So what is Variational Bayes? Well, it's a form of approximate Bayesian inference, which should be contrasted with exact Bayesian inference. So what's the difference between approximate and exact Bayesian inference?"
"Speaker 3","00;25;20;04","00;26;05;15","The key difference is that you assume a functional form for the posterior beliefs that you're trying to update from your priors to the posterior beliefs. Now, in assuming that functional form, you are going to depart from the actual true hysteria and its departure, which renders the inference schema an approximate Bayesian inference scheme. But what you by for that approximation is tracked ability so exact Bayesian inference cannot be realized physically by which I mean it's mathematically intractable and also numerically impossible to do."
"Speaker 3","00;26;05;15","00;26;36;19","Exactly. Even if you have enormous sampling and you use sampling based procedures like Metropolis Hastings or keep sampling, this open bracket is another way of approximate doing a posterior just with lots and some with a large number of samples on the sample density. So what, what, what's, what's the fundamental importance of the move from exact Bayesian inference to approximate Bayesian inference, namely variational inference?"
"Speaker 3","00;26;37;16","00;27;12;11","It's because you've assumed a functional form which makes your inference approximate. You can now analytically convert what is an impossible marginalization or integration problem into a tractable optimization problem. So just to put some flesh on that, if you wanted to use if you wanted well, let's take this refinement problem. He was trying to work out the probability distributions over all the parts the small particle could take from some initial state to some final state."
"Speaker 3","00;27;13;13","00;27;56;03","Now, given the nature of the parts he had in mind, there is a universe of an enormous uncountable number of such paths, which meant that any either analytic or numerical realization of these parts meant that the it was impossible to normalize the distribution by marginalizing or integrating over the distribution to work out the normalization constant, also known as the partition function, which you would need in order to specify the probability distribution so when people talk about an intractable marginalization or integration problem, what they mean is the very high dimensional probabilities."
"Speaker 3","00;27;56;03","00;28;59;02","It is you cannot integrate under the normalized distribution to produce a probability distribution. However, if you know the functional form, then you can create what's called an evidence bound or a variation of free energy, which is always for a physicist, always greater than the the quantity that you want to estimate or marginalize the evidence that constitutes the result of that marginalization also called the marginal likelihood, which means that if you can reduce that bound, you're guaranteed to find the minima that is always greater than the thing you actually want to minimize, which is usually the negative log of marginal likelihood which converts something impossible integration problem into a tractable optimization problem."
"Speaker 3","00;28;59;11","00;29;29;11","And that's conceptually quite important. So what it means is that you are now converting effectively an inference problem, an exact Bayesian inference problem into an optimization scheme. So now you have a formal definition of the normative account of behavior. You can now talk about inference as an optimization procedure where you're optimizing a well-defined objective function that is the variation of Y variation."
"Speaker 3","00;29;29;21","00;30;05;08","Well, very simply, given the functional form of your approximate posterior and given the functional form of the bound on the marginal likelihood or the negative, not marginal likelihood to be more precise, and you then use the calculus of variations to demonstrate this is indeed about, and thereby you can perform a gradient descent or you can find the minimum analytically as part of that optimization scheme."
"Speaker 3","00;30;05;13","00;30;19;22","So the variational Bayes just means you're using the calculus of variations to license the use of a particular approximation to the posterior."
"Speaker 1","00;30;22;24","00;30;33;26","Let's welcome Thomas. Thank you for joining. Would you like to say hi or give any overview I can continue with the question or please feel free to take it in any direction."
"Speaker 4","00;30;36;04","00;30;46;28","And well, thank you for inviting me. I don't have any particular comments at the moment because I missed the start of this apology statement late and perfect."
"Speaker 1","00;30;46;28","00;31;25;27","Well, I'll go to the question that was in the chart. So this was asked by Jax in relationship to our discussion about the balloon example and a thermometer example with hidden causes and observed consequences. Is this all in the service of homeostasis? So how can we connect what we've been talking about with this causal Bayesian framework and the variational inference to the idea of homeostasis and survival for cognitive entities as per tradition, we could go to Blue or Thomas, if you'd like to jump in on that."
"Speaker 4","00;31;27;21","00;31;28;17","No, please go ahead."
"Speaker 3","00;31;29;19","00;31;32;12","You have to give us a few minutes to settle way."
"Speaker 4","00;31;32;29","00;31;33;11","Yes."
"Speaker 2","00;31;34;09","00;31;41;00","I'm deflecting that question back to you. So you've touched every question. So far today. So we're going to let Daniel answer this one."
"Speaker 1","00;31;41;07","00;32;31;04","Aha. Sure. So just to give her first thought. So we just heard about how variation of free energy calculation is converting an impossible integration problem to attract table optimization and a gradient descent that's through time. And so if we were trying to stay within homeostatic bounds for temperature or for blood sugar or some other vital parameter, and we found ourself anywhere but exactly on the one target location, so we're some divergence away from a set point, the number of paths that we could take back to get to our set point or to get to the range of comfort just like Feynman's particles, the number of paths we could take would be infinite."
"Speaker 1","00;32;31;13","00;33;14;21","Like in the blood sugar example, you could change the regulation of every single gene and every single possible combination so the number of paths and micro states would be very large variational inference and planning as inference would give us a way to, in an unfolding through time way, functionally optimize and return to homeostasis rather than waiting on the sideline for this intractable integration to occur, we could start moving in a direction that's more like a ball rolling to the bottom of a hill, or like a molecule descending to a Gibbs free energy attractor."
"Speaker 1","00;33;15;05","00;33;36;13","But in some other space that we're doing inference in maybe blue. Next, we'll go from least knowledge to most yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;33;37;19","00;34;15;03","I don't know. I can't say, since I think there's always so we started off by saying what exists? Or If you exist, what must you do? Right? So the paper starts off saying this way. So if something exists, what does it what must it do rather must what must something do in order to exist? So it such that the reverse of this and I think homeostasis is like the most driving force behind life, which goes back to the life as we know a paper and also a particular physics."
"Speaker 2","00;34;15;20","00;34;42;00","So, so what must something do in order to exist? Something biological must maintain this non equilibrium steady state density of homeostasis because if you don't then you die. So equilibrium in the living system is death. And so, so fundamentally I think that it does come back to homeostasis yes."
"Speaker 4","00;34;46;13","00;35;18;03","Some Thomas Joy, I think I've got my bearings now. And so I think homeostasis is always quite an interesting comparison with or thing to relate back to variation inference in the bread if you can smoke. And and I think to me part of the reason for that is that homeostasis is really just the observation that sense of values tend to live in some particular space over time or some particular distribution."
"Speaker 4","00;35;18;25","00;35;42;00","And so it's more when we talk about human static bounds, what we're talking about really are just the description of how things tend to be and and coming back to this question about inverting this question of how things have to exist and going in reverse and saying, well, it does exist and it exists in this form. How does it then do it?"
"Speaker 4","00;35;42;15","00;36;09;02","And we're sort of starting when we talk about human status from the principle that we are in this range. And traditionally you then talk about negative feedback type mechanisms reflexive and correction of deviations from some set point. But you could also see that as exactly the process of maintaining some steady state density over time, of claiming probability gradients exactly as you would variation inference."
"Speaker 4","00;36;09;21","00;36;43;02","And and when you look at things in that framing then and particularly because the United States has been normalizing since, the values will always be baroreceptors or measures of glucose control, sorry, blood glucose and that sort of thing. And we're really dealing with a probability distribution over some sort of sensory data here, predominantly intercepts of data and which is effectively a marginal likelihood once you then equip it with a model of how those sensor variables are generated."
"Speaker 4","00;36;43;23","00;37;19;07","And so one of the things that's useful in terms of taking it from homeostasis to variation inference or take or putting it in the realm of the free energy principle is it then asks you to try to formulate the sort of generative model you need to be able to explain those data and therefore to to optimize your own internal environment and and that's I think, where a lot of the interesting neuroscience comes in, where you try to build the models that the brain might use and then invert the process of performing autonomic reflexes and the like."
"Speaker 1","00;37;24;02","00;37;29;02","Well, thank you, Carol. Anything to us or we can continue with other questions."
"Speaker 3","00;37;30;08","00;37;55;09","No just very briefly, just to reinforce the last two answers, you know, it's an the question is an excellent question because in a sense, the free energy principle is just about describing things that have a generalized homeostasis. So it's not saying how would you implement homeostasis? It's saying that our universe seems to be populated with things that possess spaces."
"Speaker 3","00;37;55;16","00;38;03;12","So what behaviors must they what principles must they conform to? So that, you know, it's a very good question."
"Speaker 1","00;38;05;01","00;38;43;28","And this notion of generalization, we just heard generalized homeostasis. And I'd like to ask how it's connected to other generalized generalized synchrony and generalized coordinates of motion and if there's any other generalizations, we can add those. But how might this notion of generalized homeostasis be related to generalized synchrony for one entity or in communicating ensembles? And then the notion of generalized coordinates of motion."
"Speaker 3","00;38;51;23","00;38;53;27","Shall I take that one? Sure."
"Speaker 3","00;38;56;05","00;39;44;14","Sure, I take that one first. I think there's a very close relationship between the notion of generalized synchrony and the notion of homeostasis. And by generalized, I just mean the same tendency to keep states that matter sometimes referred to as essential variables in the cybernetics literature within certain bounds or within verbal domains. If you wanted to describe that process as a systems dynamical systems theory what you would be saying is that the trajectories through some state space are limited to a relatively small attracting set and the smallness of that attracting set defines the bounds or the range that characterizes that particular system."
"Speaker 3","00;39;44;26","00;40;18;11","So for you and I, we have quite narrow balance, say, on on temperature, and that just means that dynamics keeps us within or close to those set points. So from the point of view of the, the dynamic system, understanding the, the dynamical behavior of two systems that are coupled to each other, these can either be a creature or a particle and it's embedding nature or environment on the external state."
"Speaker 3","00;40;18;11","00;40;49;02","So that could be two similar particles and data interaction the way that if they are coupled and they are both restricted to a small state set of states, or perhaps that they are relative to the total number of states or parts that they could pursue or occupy, then they're set to have a generalized synchrony technically means that I can predict how I will move given your state and vice versa."
"Speaker 3","00;40;50;05","00;41;37;21","So I think there is a very close formal relationship between the notion of generalized synchrony and and homeostasis of the kind that is accountable to the coupling between one system and another system. Generalized call. It's a motion I think meant in a slightly more technical sense so in order to understand the dynamics, so to move from a description of things in terms of where they are in some states by, say, your temperature and now to understand the processes that keep you at a certain temperature, then you have to talk about the rate of change of temperature or the paths in a state space where one dimensional coordinates of that state specify temperature."
"Speaker 3","00;41;38;07","00;42;12;17","So how would you describe mathematical paths? Well, you could just have a long list of states as an increasing function of time, or there's a more compact way of describing a path which is effectively to use a Taylor expansion and describe it with a list of coefficients of that Taylor expansion, which turn out to be the state you're in at the moment, your velocity, your acceleration, your jerk and all higher order temporal derivatives."
"Speaker 3","00;42;12;29","00;43;03;03","And if you go to an infinite number of temporal derivatives, you can now reconstruct using that Taylor expansion your trajectory into the future and into the past. So generalized currents of motion are just the observation that you have to in describing or more precisely, in defining the support of a proper listed description of a system. If you want to describe the paths, then you just augment the state with all its higher order temporal derivatives, and that's called generalized points of motion, interestingly, should be slightly disambiguate it from the way that people use generalized coordinates in physics."
"Speaker 3","00;43;03;14","00;43;42;23","So that's usually read as basically thinking about a complete description of the system just in terms of the first the state and its first order temporal derivative. So you'll come across, for example, in mechanics P and Q, so momentum and position. So if you're in quantum physics, you'll be dealing with real and imaginary parts of your particular variable or a probability distribution but the important observation here is that you've got more than one variable to describe what's going on."
"Speaker 3","00;43;43;15","00;44;08;27","And this, if you like, as a simplest kind of generalized points of motion since basically X and X prime rate of change of X or X dot, but you can extend that notion ad infinitum to create a Hilbert space sort of dimensional space where one point in this infinite dimensional space encodes or stands for mathematically represents an entire trajectory or path."
"Speaker 3","00;44;09;08","00;44;19;17","And that's a formalism that in fact the strategy principle is actually articulated in in terms of pathological formulations awesome."
"Speaker 1","00;44;22;25","00;44;24;20","Thomas, would you like to add anything there?"
"Speaker 4","00;44;26;10","00;45;02;04","It's difficult to know what to add in such a comprehensive description and I suppose what one thing I'd pick up on is and perhaps this is more a question of the comment you mentioned the idea that Taylor expansion is a more compact way of describing the trajectory, and I was wondering whether that's necessarily true and I appreciate it would be if the trajectory is relatively simple but you could argue that you need a very large number of Taylor coefficients to be able to adequately describe a more complex vocabulary and complex in the sense of nonlinear."
"Speaker 4","00;45;02;25","00;45;15;01","And. Whereas, a where it may be simpler in some circumstances just to have a series of discrete temporal points Yep."
"Speaker 3","00;45;15;09","00;45;44;21","Excellent question. So yeah, so you know, it speaks to when when I or people like me talk about compact, where sort of implicit in that statement is the notion of some truncation and certainly one truncation of the kind you just mentioned would be having a discrete set of points. But if you wanted to represent the entire path, you're obliged to write down an infinite number of numbers."
"Speaker 3","00;45;44;26","00;46;31;23","You can either write an infinite number of states as time moves forward or backwards, or you can write down an infinite number of Taylor Taylor coefficients or generalized coordinates of motion. So you can certainly generalize courts of motion in and of themselves. Don't afford any compactness. But the when you when you actually apply these different kinds of representations, practically speaking, then there are two kinds of locations that now present themselves if you're dealing with continuous time trajectories so that your path is now described as a function of time, you normally have to truncated by specifying to equals zero and some horizon in the future."
"Speaker 3","00;46;31;28","00;47;07;10","You know, the initial and the final state. So there's a choice there that you have to make in order to deal practically or numerically. Indeed, some instances analytically with a path by truncating its length in time. The equivalent truncation in general as constant motion is in terms of a a discrete bound or upper limit on the number of the the number of the generalized coordinates or order of the temporal derivatives, the nice thing, the compactness comes in generalized coordinates."
"Speaker 3","00;47;07;17","00;47;48;09","And there's a natural there's a natural space in which you can do that truncation. And that comes from the fact that as you increase the order of the temporal derivatives on the order of the generalized currents of motion, because the variance of the random fluctuations on the higher order motion gets large very, very quickly, you can assume that after a certain number of general coordinates or orders of generalized quantum motion, the precision is effectively zero."
"Speaker 3","00;47;48;22","00;48;25;10","So that means that you can get away with in describing an infinitely long trajectory with a small number of generalized coordinates because there's no further information in the higher orders. So it now becomes like a local description, but in that locality it becomes compact in the same way that you would discretely change the length of the time series or the path in a sort of in a function of time formulation."
"Speaker 3","00;48;26;13","00;48;57;26","So practically what tends to happen and it has to happen in the sense that the random fluctuations have to be fast therefore they have quite a narrow autocorrelation of function and that the shape of the autocorrelation function determines how quickly the precision of higher order motion decreases. So generally speaking, even for quite smooth random fluctuations, you don't need generalized orders of motion beyond about four to 6 hours of motion."
"Speaker 3","00;48;58;02","00;49;26;07","So just practically speaking, then you now have a compact representation but in doing that truncation you now can no longer roll out the path using the Taylor approximation to take infinity. You can only roll it out with confidence for for a relatively shorter period of time. It's not defined precisely because of course you're you're defining it probabilistically because you've got random fluctuations in play."
"Speaker 3","00;49;27;02","00;49;32;12","So it has a sort of soft locality associated with it, but only when you do the truncation."
"Speaker 1","00;49;35;06","00;49;55;13","Awesome, awesome. I'll ask a follow up on the Taylor series, especially in SPM, the statistical parametric mapping. There's discussion of the Volterra series. So what is the Volterra series? How is it different from a Taylor series? And what are they doing."
"Speaker 3","00;50;00;02","00;50;02;15","As blue one to take the social Thomas again?"
"Speaker 4","00;50;04;13","00;50;28;29","I can have a go, but I think that's a bit before my time being in Volta. That's the and as I understand that, it's more of a kernel based representation of dynamics where you looking at convolution with particular kernels over time as an expression of how dynamics might evolve. Beyond that, I think I'll probably have to reflect back to a couple of to answer that one in any detail, and that's what."
"Speaker 1","00;50;29;29","00;50;39;25","I'm asking you to understand. A little bit of the history of the movement from focusing on the Taylor and the Volterra to only seeing the Taylor series in the current paper, we're discussing."
"Speaker 3","00;50;42;13","00;51;16;10","So but Thomas is absolutely right that the Volterra series is a way of describing convolution operators that are an equivalent description of your equations of motion in terms of convolution kernels of increasingly high order but you're also absolutely right implicitly in the sense that a Volterra kernel expansion just is a functional Taylor approximation to any given dynamical system."
"Speaker 3","00;51;17;09","00;52;13;09","So what's the difference between a Taylor expansion of a path of a function and a functional and a functional approximation? And it it just it's using exactly the same technology, but now it's expanding the or applying the Taylor approximation to the equations of motion so the functions that determine the flow of the system. So you're applying a Taylor approximation to the flow operators or the equations of motion, but the spirit of the expansion is exactly the same as a standard Taylor expansion I don't think we need to know much more about it really in the sense that the Volterra series expansion is another way of providing a compact description, compact in the sense you truncate"
"Speaker 3","00;52;13;09","00;52;46;24","the Taylor expansion in the same way we were just describing truncating the order of generalized cords of motion to get a compact representation and in some instances a compact inversion scheme. So normally when people actually apply and certainly as we apply in a practical data analysis context Volterra series, we generally don't worry about very high order terms. And in fact all our software has been just to do with first and second order terms."
"Speaker 3","00;52;46;24","00;53;26;04","So we actually stop at the second order, second order derivatives of functional derivatives, which is, you know, even simpler than that. The you know, stopping at the fourth or the sixth order in terms of expressing the original variables in general is called summation. But because it's really a device that just really represents a differential equation in terms of convolution, operators and kernels, it doesn't really get you anywhere in terms of understanding the mechanics or the theory behind it."
"Speaker 3","00;53;26;13","00;54;09;05","So there is nothing in the free energy principle that refers to the as serious expansion, but you could always derive a Voltaire as soon as expansion and implicit kernels to a certain order, given some differential equations that's at hand. And if those differential equations are doing a gradient descent on free energy, such as in a Bayesian filter, you could always articulate a Bayesian filter in terms of a convolution operator, which might be one way of understanding how Bayesian smoothing and Bayesian filtering operates."
"Speaker 1","00;54;10;06","00;54;24;01","The awesome where Deckard evolving and adding action in many, many layers and adding more depth to the de convolution and to the planning and inference blue."
"Speaker 2","00;54;26;15","00;54;55;18","So speaking of convolution, I have a follow up question that's maybe a little bit convoluted or hopefully I can articulate articulate it well. So what we're talking about in the very beginning of the paper, you talk about the Focker Planck equation and then you talk about the path integral information and the Parker pick fucker Planck encompasses random fluctuations and then the path integral formulation encompasses the trajectory of a particle."
"Speaker 2","00;54;55;26","00;55;22;21","And we talked about or you talked about the fast path and the slow path and the fucker fucker Planck as fast and then the path integral is slow so I just want to kind of try to wrap my mind around what happens like for atoms inside of my cells, OK, they're the density is over. States like the atoms can occupy excited states or any number of states, but the cells are really the ones doing the work."
"Speaker 2","00;55;22;21","00;55;50;07","The move, the motion is happening inside of cells. So that's kind of the slow the slow procedure, right? The path, integral path. But, but then when you think about the cells, they're in my body. So the cells that are occupying the states and I'm doing the moving around. So then I'm on the trajectory. And similarly, like I am in any number of states with all the rest of the humans on planet Earth, all in any number of like we could be any number of places, but they're all on planet Earth."
"Speaker 2","00;55;50;14","00;56;06;29","And then planet Earth is moving at a slower trajectory so what does the mass kind of or can, can you guess or maybe foreshadow how the mass compresses or unfolds in this kind of hierarchical situation?"
"Speaker 3","00;56;12;05","00;56;16;21","So Thomas has to answer that world and you have to use the word re normalization group."
"Speaker 4","00;56;17;17","00;56;50;11","Therefore, you might say that that's going to try it out. But now that you've said that so just to start with, I mean, you mentioned the the this problem to start with in the context of the focal point equation, and the path integral formulations and and looking at that sort of distinction and which I think is is interesting when thinking about constant slow, but is to some extent some orthogonal."
"Speaker 4","00;56;50;20","00;57;19;20","I think it's interesting when thinking about fast and slow in that you might expect that the the the focal point equation describing the rate of change or the evolution of some probability density is going to be a slower evolution than the evolution of sort of individual particles that might be described by the stochastic differential equation. As long as one equation of that system, there may be very fast fluctuations."
"Speaker 4","00;57;19;20","00;57;48;08","But really what we're dealing with, meeting with the Planck equation is some summary statistics and slower change over time that might be reflective of the mean or variance. And that does link back then into the idea of the re normalization group, which is a way of describing how things at one temporal scale can be summarized in terms of some slower changes and some faster changes."
"Speaker 4","00;57;49;06","00;58;16;24","Typically, the way you might do that in a dynamic system setting would be to look at the the jacobian which is the linearized version of the flow equation and look at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And then I can tell you how quickly the system is either expanding or contracting or how quickly it's decaying in one direction or in and unstable systems going off towards infinity."
"Speaker 4","00;58;17;17","00;59;02;06","And that means that if you take the set of values, they will tell you a series of different directions that the system is changing in and the speed with which they're changing. That means that you can you can choose at some point at which or some threshold above which the eigenvalues are considered slow and below which they're considered fast the right way round I have assumes that negative market values, these eigenvalues are each associated with an eigenvector, which is just a way of expressing some linear combination of the components that system or and you could think of it as the direction in some high dimensional space that describes the position of that system at any"
"Speaker 4","00;59;02;06","00;59;37;27","one time by separating things out or separating out the eigenvectors and the particular directions based upon whether the eigenvalues are large or small, you can separate the system out into its components that move very slowly and decay very rapidly, very slowly, and those that decay very rapidly and and that's effectively the principle that the re normalization group works on when applied to these kinds of systems, because it then says that even if we have some way of describing all the things in that system, we separated them out into the fast and slow components."
"Speaker 4","00;59;37;27","01;00;16;26","We can then say, Well, let's just look at the fast components, find some new way of grouping them, and then look at the source components of that or the slow components of that and continue separating these out. Hierarchically it's a multiple different scales and that can be quite interesting in a range of settings to think about emergent behavior, you might get at higher and higher levels when the dynamics at the lower level might be might be a very simple description and and I think that's probably what you were getting at when you were talking about the, the sort of very fast movement of atoms in your yourselves versus the slightly slower movement of yourself and"
"Speaker 4","01;00;16;26","01;00;41;29","the even slower movement of things that are much larger and evolving for a much larger timescale. You could read each move from one time scale to the slower time scale as an application of a re normalization group operator is that enough yet from your perspective, Karl, have I said the words re normalization group enough yes."
"Speaker 3","01;00;42;16","01;00;43;06","That's excellent."
"Speaker 1","01;00;43;06","01;01;31;02","Thank interesting. I just wrote down Thomas when you said thinking about fast and slow and that place as a race matter, Bayesian in cognitive systems, on cognitive systems angle, any entity might be thinking fast and slow famous work, but this is thinking about the fast and the slow maybe of a cognitive entity and maybe that's multi scale. So I'm going to bring another question into chat and then we'll be continuing on what type of boundary does a marker blanket define for a system functional in terms of ports or constructive and modular with interfaces?"
"Speaker 1","01;01;31;18","01;01;35;22","Or might both viewpoints be considered depending on modeling reasons."
"Speaker 4","01;01;42;22","01;01;53;17","I think to me you may have to unpack what some of those terms mean a little bit more and when you're talking about ports and and whether they're constructed, what does that mean?"
"Speaker 1","01;01;56;00","01;02;39;20","It was a question from the chat, so I'll try to unpack and see what you think perhaps even a general question would be what is the physical interpretation of these Markov like? It's that are being identified. Are they causal or functional connections that occur across an interface like a USB port, or are they the interfaces themselves or in what viewpoints exist to interpret the Markov blanket in terms of the modeling of some defined system of interest."
"Speaker 4","01;02;45;20","01;03;06;20","It's an interesting question, but quite a few levels, and I think you could probably you could probably unpack each of those terms in several different ways. And I, I guess the first thing to do is think about how we define a mock of blanket and what it, what it actually means, because we can we can sit around interpreting it in various ways for different sorts of systems."
"Speaker 4","01;03;07;07","01;03;29;08","But actually the key the key thing is that it's a probabilistic relationship. It's the relationship between and only three distinct sets of variables. And where we're saying that's two of those types of variable are separated by the milk of blankets probabilistically. And all that means is that the, the two that are being separated are conditionally independent of one another."
"Speaker 4","01;03;29;09","01;03;59;19","Once we know the thing that's doing the separating and the thing that's doing the separating is the blanket. And, and often that means that there are direct relationships between each of those things in the blankets, but no direct relationship across the blanket. But then it's important to think about what sort of relationships we're talking about whether those are dynamical relationships and, and causal relationships and all sorts of other other ways you can describe the interactions between pairs of states."
"Speaker 4","01;04;00;17","01;04;36;00","And and there's a discussion we've had on and off for the last couple of years really about what is the relationship between dynamics and them and probabilistic relationships and even which probability distributions are appropriate to to use to even to find a blanket blanket of this sort and one answer to that is that we can look at the mark of blankets associated with some steady state density and but we can also do the same thing with any probability distribution, which includes distributions over and over the past."
"Speaker 4","01;04;36;00","01;05;19;25","And look at the independence or dependance between different paths when when formulation in terms of path, there's a slightly clearer relationship between the dynamics of the system and the mark of blankets, because once we set the path of one variable or two sets of variables are independent on another. Given the truth about the coupling implies a certain degree of sparse coupling and between those in the end, it's an amicable setting and set up and is probably once you look at the dynamical setting, there's as much of the physics as you predict it might come in because you can then start to interpret that in terms of physical influences and things that might cause an exploration"
"Speaker 4","01;05;19;25","01;05;48;20","or a change in velocity or change in position and in temperature in terms of physical forces. And there are there are, of course, other ways in which you can look at multiplying. It's and sometimes they're interpreted in terms of sort of cell membranes and that sort of thing. And I wondered whether that was what was meant when ports were mentioned, because you can think of sort of ion channels as being ports, the allow interactions between two sets of states."
"Speaker 4","01;05;49;03","01;06;28;10","I think when people make those sorts of comparisons, you have to be very careful about what exactly mean which variables reflect different parts of that blanket. So for instance, you might talk about intracellular extracellular ion concentrations and being independent of one another conditioned upon the state of some cellular protein and so I think again, it's an interesting question and there are lots of different ways you could unpack it and you can think about a range of different systems and try and interpret what mark of blanket is that and what the physical interpretation of that is if it is a physical system."
"Speaker 4","01;06;29;04","01;06;43;24","And ultimately, I think probably the physics of it is going to be articulated most clearly in terms of nominal equations and which sometimes better direct relationships and work with monkeys. But it depends where it's defined or not to and."
"Speaker 1","01;06;48;24","01;07;23;24","Awesome there was two complementary ways that this question one, it's like this is where the two paths first branched and they're complementary. But could you describe where Equation one begins and read it however you see fit and then the question mark at the end and then help us understand how the probability density can be expressed in two complementary ways."
"Speaker 1","01;07;25;03","01;07;34;10","What is Equation one showing? What does the question mark leave us with and how do these two sides shown on the left and the right provide two complementary approaches."
"Speaker 4","01;07;44;19","01;08;16;00","I feel like I've done much talking, but I'm happy to take this one as well. If you'd like me to answer. So the first line of Equation one, we're really just describing some dynamical system that has some fluctuations associated with it. So there's some degree of randomness where that randomness may be interpretable. It's deterministic behavior at a much faster scale that we're effectively ignoring through the application of our normalization group that we were speaking about earlier."
"Speaker 4","01;08;17;03","01;08;48;23","And so R X in this equation is this it's a variable that's evolving through time. And the F of X describes how in a deterministic system, the rate of change of number that variable would depend upon the variable itself, depend upon its position in space. And the major term at the end here it tells us that some additional fluctuations associated with that, something that's changing in the less predictable way, at least the scale and speed of description."
"Speaker 4","01;08;48;23","01;09;19;22","We're interested in the second line of the equation and provides a little bit a little more definition to that. So the first equality is relating the current position of the system, the current X to the the probability density, describing the fluctuations as saying how that's likely to be at any one point. And here we're saying that it's something that is zero mean."
"Speaker 4","01;09;19;29","01;10;03;19","So if we were to take an average over time, the fluctuation would end up averaging to zero. And then we're also defining a variance that's associated with this, and that's this two times gamma parameter. It's actually tells us about the the amplitude of those fluctuations the implication symbol then is saying, okay, so if we and if we found that or if we've defined it in this way, so we now know the form of fluctuations that then tells us the form of the rate of change of X and and we know that if the average rate of change is at or the average fluctuation is going to be zero, then the average rate of change of"
"Speaker 4","01;10;03;19","01;10;32;09","X is just going to be F of X. So the same path or the same rate of change the X would have if we were dealing with a deterministic system. However, we then have this additional uncertainty around that rate of change and which inherits exactly the same variance as the random fluctuations did. So we then finally have this this third line which says, so what is this probability distribution?"
"Speaker 4","01;10;32;09","01;11;06;16","How do we now account for and what's the distribution of X would be sometime or and let's say at some time to make an additional distinction that isn't necessarily expressed in this slide, which is that we can talk about the distribution of X evolving through time from some initial conditions, or we can talk about the distribution that will eventually attain if we if we wait until we're a long way from our initial conditions, which is then the steady state."
"Speaker 4","01;11;06;16","01;11;44;07","That is the point at which the focal point equation evaluates to zero. And so there are several ways now we can we can think about the distribution of X and the density associated with this equation. Three then says, well, we could also look at it a different way and think about some distribution or density over alternative trajectories that X take and alternative paths, which is a description of a slightly different sort of quantity that is equivalent in many ways because they determined by exactly the same things does not sort of make sense."
"Speaker 4","01;11;44;07","01;11;45;11","And I've said quite a lot that."
"Speaker 1","01;11;49;28","01;11;50;12","Awesome."
"Speaker 4","01;11;53;21","01;11;55;21","Have I got myself out of answering the next question?"
"Speaker 1","01;11;57;07","01;12;37;23","Yes, probably one rain pass maybe we can even just continue walking through and understanding the Formalisms. It's how we structure the zeros is where the formalisms and the figures in order. And so we follow along and try to connect key points in between. So you wrote that both the Focker plank and the Path integral formulations inherit their functional form from assumptions about the statistics of random fluctuations in one which we just described then you describe the path of least action and the most likely path."
"Speaker 1","01;12;38;09","01;12;55;03","So what is happening in for where is the fluctuation being reduced to zero, and what does it mean to take the most likely path or the path of least action blue?"
"Speaker 3","01;12;55;14","01;12;57;05","Do you want to do this or do you want me to it?"
"Speaker 2","01;12;58;27","01;13;01;16","Definitely, by all means oh, I don't see. Why don't you go?"
"Speaker 3","01;13;02;03","01;13;36;10","OK, so just to backtrack a little bit and just to reiterate some of the key points that Thomas just made, just notice that the everything basically starts with this large equation or stochastic differential equation. And then you can go in one of two ways. You can go by the density dynamics description of the type of the probability density distributions, which is a description which is deterministic or you can go by the political formulation and you can map gracefully between one or the other."
"Speaker 3","01;13;36;24","01;13;58;12","They're complimentary, can derive one from the other, a little bit like the difference between dealing with the equations of motion or dealing with the convolution operators. And we're just talking about that equivalent in many senses however, the way that they are used in the free energy principle are very distinct. So I just wanted to rehearse that because that speaks to the particular question here."
"Speaker 3","01;14;00;05","01;14;30;02","Where, where, where did the random fluctuations go? And before I do that, though, just to note that all that the first equality in equation one is telling you is that there is some probabilistic relationship between X and X dot that's all it's saying. It's saying that there is some coupling. And normally in terms of a causal coupling between a function of X and X dot."
"Speaker 3","01;14;30;18","01;14;59;12","So we just think about our previous conversation in terms of generalized currents of motion and everything coming along in pairs like P's and Q's and particle physics or real and imagined reason in quantum physics. And this is why there's always a pair of things at least two things to worry about, because all we're saying here is that the sum relationship between where you are and how you're moving in state space and it's a probabilistic relationship."
"Speaker 3","01;14;59;22","01;15;17;20","And so if you, if you think about what that means in terms of modeling things, this is a states based model. So it tells you nothing about which is the most likely state to be it. It just tells you how likely, where am I going to go from here? That's all. It's all it's telling you. That's all we know."
"Speaker 3","01;15;18;01","01;15;36;17","And so you can start to think now about the probability distributions of where I will be in the future or you can think about probabilities, options over the trajectories or the paths that you take. And that's basically what Thomas was was highlighting previously."
"Speaker 3","01;15;40;14","01;16;06;11","In the free energy principle. The Focker plank is actually not used very much. So I'm not saying for Blue's benefit. She's worried about the so fast and slow. And how does that fit into the Focker plank? In fact, most of the interesting stuff comes from the pathological formulation that the Focker plank is, you know, just bringing a lot to the table, but only when you look at the solutions to the Focker plank equation."
"Speaker 3","01;16;06;11","01;16;52;10","That you would get under the assumption that it has a solution and you get into things like the Helmholtz decomposition. And so an oil flow and all that interesting stuff and the link between the steady state density of the states and the that dynamical coupling that underwrites or defines the that's the original all on equation. But if you can ignore all that if you wanted to and just talk about the probabilities separations over paths, so no longer am I defining me my homeostasis in terms of the states that I occupy, that's a side product of the trajectories and the dynamics that I typically evince when I'm in this situation or at this point in state"
"Speaker 3","01;16;52;10","01;17;17;10","space. So I think the more powerful and certainly the the basis of the free energy principle, the more powerful calculus is actually in the package formulation. So you can tell a free energy principle story without mentioning the focal plank equation if you wanted to. And really that story is a story of least action or Hamilton's principle of least action."
"Speaker 3","01;17;17;10","01;17;41;20","So what does that mean? It just means that one way of summarizing the behavior of things or the characteristic behavior of things is in terms the most likely way forward from here, the most likely trajectory or path from this point in state space and what is that? It is the path of least action. What is that is nothing more than the most likely path."
"Speaker 3","01;17;42;06","01;18;13;25","What is the most likely path? Well, it's just given by the large value equation, the flow operator, the F of X iterated in time, in the absence or under the most likely random fluctuations. So what are the most likely random fluctuations? What we just said that the most likely random fluctuation is zero. So all that we're doing is taking the omega, the random fluctuations out of the equations of motion, and that just is the path of least action."
"Speaker 3","01;18;14;05","01;18;46;17","Where which is just the most likely path. And if you apply the calculus of variations to that notion, you get these expressions that are in equation for here. So they if you interpret the action A as the probability or the surprise or or the negative log probability of a particular path, then if you want to minimize the action, you're just trying to identify the path that that is most likely."
"Speaker 3","01;18;46;17","01;19;13;21","That is just the evolution of the system without any random fluctuations. So the first expression which follows a convention pursued in this paper and other papers that that the path of least action, namely the most likely parts are in boldface. All this says is the most likely path in boldface simply is that which renders that path the most likely for this system."
"Speaker 3","01;19;14;01","01;20;05;06","Which is another way of saying that it minimizes the action. And what does that mean? Well, it means that if you deviate from this path in any way, that is a variation, variation, variational calculus. If you vary or deviate from this path, then you are going to increase the action so you can think of a marble rolling down a long valley and the course of the model rolling down a long valley will or will follow a trajectory that is always the minimum of the the height of the valley and therefore, any deviation from that path will cause you to climb the sides of the valley and therefore the path integral or the average action perfect."
"Speaker 3","01;20;05;14","01;20;46;16","And the average action will be slightly bigger than the path of least action. So that's basically what is meant by the second implication, which is that any variation of the path about the path of least action will cause an increase in the action. And another way of stating that is that the path of least action at the point of the minima infinitesimal changes don't change the action because you're at the flat bottom, or that microscopically the valley has has bottomed out and therefore your variation is zero."
"Speaker 3","01;20;47;12","01;21;08;12","And another way of expressing that is where we started, which is that the path of least action follows the trajectory in the absence of any random fluctuations, which is just the final equality down that so it's just the original Launchpad equation, but without random fluctuations or with the most likely random fluctuations."
"Speaker 1","01;21;10;19","01;21;41;20","So I brought up, as you saw, this classical Washington epigenetic landscape. Here's the marble rolling down a hill coming towards us. Might we interpret decisions as being bifurcations or if we're talking about paths of least action in space or paths of least action on cognitive parameters where do decisions come into play?"
"Speaker 3","01;21;48;18","01;21;52;23","That's definitely far below that one yep."
"Speaker 1","01;21;52;23","01;21;53;09","I knew it."
"Speaker 2","01;21;56;20","01;22;24;07","So can, can we even make decisions? I'm going to just answer your question with a question because I mean, if if up until this point we are just the sum of all the things that have occurred up until this point, you know, we now have a model that that's based on all previous action. And when you come to this bifurcating path, you're just gonna take the one that minimizes free energy right?"
"Speaker 2","01;22;24;07","01;22;35;11","Like, isn't that how it goes? So according to your model and all the things that have brought an organism to that point, that's my answer."
"Speaker 3","01;22;36;13","01;22;41;22","Right? I want Thomas to answer now, but he can't he must use the words free will."
"Speaker 4","01;22;43;17","01;22;48;11","I am not going there. I don't think that is qualified enough to use those words."
"Speaker 2","01;22;48;26","01;22;51;24","I skipped right over it. But, but, but said it for less."
"Speaker 1","01;22;55;05","01;23;04;16","Anyone can address how is free will related to free energy or how decision making plays into a path of least action."
"Speaker 3","01;23;05;11","01;23;38;00","But while Thomas is gathering his thoughts, which slip free will, another philosophical sense into his response I think that's absolutely right. So, you know, the notion of a bifurcation, I think is very prescient when you think about a path of least action on any energy landscape, in particular free energy landscape. And but at the same time, we if we just pursue the path of least action, there are no decisions or it looks as if there are no decisions for a mathematical point of view."
"Speaker 3","01;23;38;14","01;24;20;07","But in virtue of the fact that there is an indeterminacy about the path you would pursue from the initial where you start, say, the marble of the beginning of the top of the hill here that indeterminacy, I think, does call into question whether the technically the chaotic structure that underwrites the tendency of the thing that we are trying to model will actually induce a sensitivity to initial conditions, which means that we can never totally predict how we will behave or the decisions we will make given our state of mind and the state of the world at the present time."
"Speaker 3","01;24;20;07","01;24;53;15","So I think there is a latitude to talk about free will, but it would be of the kind that inherits from deterministic chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions. And that's that's quite important of framing it in the context of both occasions and determining stick dynamical systems theory is quite an important move because of course the logical equation does not admit deterministic chaos because you've got random fluctuations."
"Speaker 3","01;24;54;07","01;25;29;05","So you have to castaic chaos or you could have stochastic chaos, but you can't have deterministic chaos. So the question now is where does better? Is there any opportunity for deterministic chaos in the context of the free energy description of such behavior and choice making? And I think there is, but only in a very special class of systems where the internal the particular states or the internal states and the blanket states don't have any random fluctuations."
"Speaker 3","01;25;29;10","01;26;08;03","And you may be asking, well, they must always have random fluctuations. Well, not necessarily at a particular scale. If you take 100 million neurons or say even a billion neurons and you now write down your state as the average of a population or ensemble of neurons, all the random fluctuations in neural noise will be averaged away and this is exactly the same mechanics of Thomas was talking about before in terms of the body normalization group and taking certain mixtures carefully to eliminate fast fluctuations and random fluctuations."
"Speaker 3","01;26;08;13","01;26;52;20","So the argument would be that here, if you want to talk about bifurcations in the sense of transit, critical bifurcations are bifurcations as a way of describing a particular possibly faction or possibly faction from slightly different initial conditions, then I think you'd have to be perfectly licensed to do that, but you'd have to be very careful in saying that we are assuming here that the dynamics are deterministic and therefore only apply at a particular scale, and they applied it at a scale where the particular dynamics, the internal and Blunkett states don't possess any random fluctuations of that matter."
"Speaker 3","01;26;53;13","01;27;18;07","And that's quite interesting because there are other things that inherit from that, that assumption. So, you know, again, collapses and notion of different kinds of particles, some very, very small particles, single cells and blue was talking about before, maybe so small as in number and in size that you can average away the random fluctuations and they would not show any deterministic chaos."
"Speaker 3","01;27;18;19","01;27;47;12","But there may be a course a great description of neuronal dynamics and computational anatomy that does actually acquire a deterministic aspect, a classical aspect where you have an end body like problem, which will invariably show some kind of deterministic chaos, which means that then you can get back to and one form of looking at that or something that would look like free will anyway."
"Speaker 3","01;27;47;22","01;27;51;28","Now, Thomas has had plenty of time to tell us about the dynamics of freewill."
"Speaker 4","01;27;54;26","01;28;26;27","So I notice that the way you framed that was in terms of unpredictability and this under the definition of free will, you're using that it's things where we wouldn't necessarily be able to predict in advance how well or how a particular system would evolve. And I'm sure that will please some philosophers systems, upsets many others and I don't have an alternative definition, but it would seem that would work better."
"Speaker 3","01;28;27;00","01;28;27;20","As everybody."
"Speaker 4","01;28;30;11","01;29;04;15","And so I suppose we've spoken really about one side of things, which is the deterministic aspects and clearly that does become very relevant at larger and slower scales. And I suppose it's also interesting to think about unpredictability when stochastic dynamics become much more important. So we certainly could think about systems where there are multiple plausible paths and where and where that or even a continuum multiple paths."
"Speaker 4","01;29;04;15","01;29;35;19","And the particular path they end up taking will depend upon the particular values that the fluctuations take during the course of that path. Arguably if the fluctuations are themselves just generic or systems that aren't deterministic that are occurring at a much faster scale, it's still not really an unpredictability of the stochastic sort because ultimately it's described by deterministic dynamical system, which again brings us back to this randomization group idea."
"Speaker 4","01;29;36;23","01;30;17;29","And it depends a little bit on your your interpretation of what happens at the slowest or the fastest possible scales. And when we perform this normalization operation, is the faster scale something that is genuinely random or is it something that is a sort of recursive and recursively faster deterministic dynamics? And either way, it may be that if stochastic descriptions are most appropriate to some scale of description, we can develop a form of unpredictability, both from things like deterministic chaos and uncertainty of initial conditions."
"Speaker 4","01;30;18;15","01;30;44;21","But also potentially from the moment and at the valuations that happen along a particular trajectory in systems that have more randomness involved clearly when we're doing and when we're trying to describe a real system, we're real brain. And the decisions people make we clearly don't have access to every part of the system and what every year of that brain is doing."
"Speaker 4","01;30;44;21","01;31;20;14","So to some extent, we're always dealing with a partial stochastic system and and that feeds into how we might end up modeling behavior of those kinds of systems as well. So if we were trying to do this in active style model to real behavior and we can simulate very often what we end up doing is adding in a term to account for some uncertainty in the action selection or uncertainty that we as experimenters have in the action someone might choose, even if we think we know what the expected strategy they're going to calculate is and how they're going to evaluate the alternative parts they might choose."
"Speaker 4","01;31;21;09","01;31;47;25","And so that's just an acknowledgment that if we don't know everything if we don't have a complete description of the system, then we have to some extent allow for some stochastic parts of that course that that stochastic element may be purely the uncertainty of the initial conditions in a system that can exhibits chaotic behavior and that bifurcates and various different weights awesome."
"Speaker 1","01;31;48;29","01;32;24;29","We'll continue on as we approach the end of the DART one and introduce something we had talked about in terms of the Markov blanket previously, but it's the particular partition. So how have other mechanics addressed particles and how does this particle framework do something different? And what does that different framing enable it's blue turn, or if you give a shot."
"Speaker 2","01;32;28;02","01;32;29;04","Why don't you go ahead, Daniel?"
"Speaker 1","01;32;30;07","01;33;11;11","OK, as a non physicist, my understanding is that particles have not been explicitly modeled this way and fields or continua have been the norm for a particular description provided here enables principled approach to separating figure from ground from separating an entity that's being tracked, that's doing the movement away from the entity that is not doing the movement in a sense, that would just be one thought."
"Speaker 3","01;33;15;15","01;33;48;11","Which I would concur with very much. You know, it's if you if you go back and think about the physics you did at school, usually we will be focused on the behavior of some idealized gas in what they would call a heat wave or a heat reservoir. And really what the particular petition brings to the table are deep questions about how did that heat back at that and the heat path now stands in for blanket states and what's beyond the heat of the external states."
"Speaker 3","01;33;48;23","01;34;18;06","So, you know, it is it is a move which I am not aware of being attempted in any other branch of physics. So in quantum physics, the mark of blanket or the thing that contains the particle of interest probabilistically speaking is usually defined in terms of its critical potential and the functional form of that potential leads to all the applications of quantum electrodynamics that you might encounter."
"Speaker 3","01;34;18;17","01;35;15;25","And I repeat, in thermodynamics, people just talk about that being so blanket states in terms of a heat map, but don't go there. Don't think about what's beyond the heap of in terms of classical mechanics. Perhaps there is a notion of particles there, which is thus less if you like, hidden under the rock the rug. But of course you don't have any explicit representation of the internal dynamics because normally classical mechanics is just dealing with the motion of heavenly bodies or large massive objects without really thinking about that, the facet dynamics that underwrite autonomous movement or animate movement or what people in chemistry might refer to as active matter."
"Speaker 1","01;35;17;23","01;35;44;15","Just a few thoughts on that. The classical indeed, it does deal with diffusing particles, mass of bodies, but just like you pointed out, it doesn't consider internal states. So it's like a view from the outside. And this is a bit more like a view from both sides, which enables us to have sentient or cognitive behavior on both sides of the observation interface rather than implicitly on only one side, which is a very different situation."
"Speaker 1","01;35;44;28","01;36;10;07","And then you talked about in this thermo physics context and in this quantum physics context, like what is beyond the boundary and then in the quantum case, you said that that was like the role of the heat bath. And what's outside of it is the Schrodinger potential and what's outside of it. And that makes me think about Schrodinger's implicit question and Schrodinger's explicit question."
"Speaker 1","01;36;10;21","01;37;00;04","Schrodinger's explicit question in 1944 and in Ramstad at all 2018 was what is life. Schrodinger's implicit question was what is beyond the quantum what is outside of that and so it's almost interesting though appropriate that the particular partition actually brings those two together. But I would let anyone else reflect to how they're brought together if you will wants to add or we'll just continue to leave a few little pieces before closing the dark one."
"Speaker 3","01;37;01;21","01;37;31;14","I was hoping that Thomas in blue, he has an excellent observation and I just wanted to reinforce it and so, you know, what is life basically coming back to our earlier question, it's those it's those systems that are equipped with a homeostasis of sorts. But beyond that, these things move. So there are cysts, there are homeostatic systems that are self constructed thing and self maintaining that move."
"Speaker 3","01;37;31;23","01;38;04;02","And this, I think, speaks to the importance of having this the active states, the coupled back influence, the the external states beyond the mark of blankets. You know, again, speaking to another important lateral kind, the distance between inert particles and active particles where you've got this active sort of poetic like aspect to the maintenance of of the homeostasis so, you know, I think that's quite an important observation that we're not talking about."
"Speaker 3","01;38;04;07","01;38;31;22","You know, we are talking about a bi directional exchange across the mark of blanket. Just to reiterate your sort of observation that what we're doing here is trying to account for the coupling between the inside and the outside. That's something we're not just interested in the inside as in classical physics or the outside, but it looks like from the outside in terms of them have statistical mechanics or what it looks like from the outside."
"Speaker 3","01;38;31;22","01;38;40;11","In terms of classical mechanics, we're actually trying to get to the meat of the maintenance of the mark of blanket and thickness in an inactive context."
"Speaker 1","01;38;43;00","01;39;14;23","So then as a closing round here, I want to point to one tension that we pulled in the dot zero. So here in footnote 21, it says a lot of interesting things, but then it says minimization implies a teleology that goes beyond any claim of the FFP to particles, minimize surprises or free energy. Well, minimization implies a teleology that goes beyond any claim of the FFP."
"Speaker 1","01;39;15;17","01;39;57;14","OK, very well. Later the question is asked, is it tenable to interpret gradient flows on variation of free energy as variational inference, or is this just teleological window dressing? So where is Teleology is to teleology in the FSP, or is it window dressing? What's the window what's the building? What's outside the building is minimization teleological? And is that in the AFP's claims or what other claims are coming to the table if it's not part of FFP in the strict sense."
"Speaker 3","01;40;01;08","01;40;03;03","This is Thomas's favorite question."
"Speaker 1","01;40;04;22","01;40;05;11","I did know."
"Speaker 4","01;40;08;29","01;40;14;06","My favorite question in that in this I've asked this for several."
"Speaker 3","01;40;14;06","01;40;14;22","Times."
"Speaker 4","01;40;16;15","01;40;16;23","And."
"Speaker 3","01;40;16;23","01;40;18;05","Waxed lyrical about it."
"Speaker 4","01;40;22;24","01;40;56;27","And it is a it is a tricky question. It's always I mean, to some extent the answer to that, the big bold question is both and I think it's also worth asking the question, is it useful? And so the reason we've spoken about it questions in the past. And 11 of the reasons it's come up is that in some of the recent formulations we've dealt with in the papers that we've been discussing is that it's free energy."
"Speaker 4","01;40;57;03","01;41;33;24","Well, the great inflows have been on some and normally steady state density, and that can be interpretable as a generative model of sorts, or there's a marginal likelihood and now the challenges that a marginal likelihoods in itself is not or is, is, I suppose, a special case of the free energy when the variation or density that we were speaking about earlier was tractable, part of the optimization problem is exactly equal to a true posterior density."
"Speaker 4","01;41;33;25","01;42;07;24","When we performed pavements so the question we've often asked is whether the whether that's tail divergence, whether it's divergence between our approximate distribution or variation of distribution and our true exact Bayesian solution, and whether if that is defined stipulated there's been zero, whether there is a meaningful role of a free energy minimization as being interpretable, as inference and there are several possible answers."
"Speaker 4","01;42;07;25","01;42;37;05","That one is that that that we're really dealing with. And the when we're when we're engaging in computational neuroscience, we're dealing with a tractable approximation to how systems behave. So it's useful from the perspective of a computational neuroscientist to be able to write it down into the free energy functional and but not necessarily treat that as a literal description of what brains and sentient creatures are doing."
"Speaker 4","01;42;37;13","01;42;59;26","In terms of the variation for energy aspect, we could still interpret the model likelihood as before. Well, interpret gradient flows in the motion like this as before. And another answer to it is that part of what makes inference work, particularly in an animal setting, is not going to the bottom of the free energy minimum, but it's finding where it's staying there."
"Speaker 4","01;43;00;17","01;43;17;06","And so that depends upon the ability to predict and the ability to represent some dynamics of how a system's evolving at a time over time. So it's a question of staying at the bottom of the model, staying at the bottom of the valley and not deviating up the sides. And we could interpret that as a form of inference as well."
"Speaker 4","01;43;17;06","01;43;47;15","And here we then deal with flows that are not necessarily up or down for energy gradients or motion like equations, but are maintaining the same level of well staying at the bottom of the valley. And that's often what we refer to in terms of the solenoid offloads. And this links back to a lot of the discussion that we're having about deterministic versus sort of chaotic dynamics or I suppose deterministic chaos where and systems can behave in a range of different ways."
"Speaker 4","01;43;47;16","01;44;12;02","It's very difficult to capture view just going up and down probability gradients. So it talks about how we go around probability gradients, how we circle round the hell or Long Valley and the potentially chaotic way that we do that. And that results in the form of prediction. It results in a way of staying at the bottom of the valley and not not leaving it."
"Speaker 4","01;44;12;02","01;44;42;17","So we could interpret that as a form of inference as well. And I think that probably being on still an open question as to whether, whether and under certain circumstances it looks as if we are also minimizing the scale divergence, perhaps this divergence between the and approximate and exact Bayesian posteriors. And I think that's still open. I think plausibly there will be ways of writing things down that look as if they're doing that."
"Speaker 4","01;44;43;03","01;45;21;27","It may be that it's simply a useful approximation to how we tend to overlook the useful approximation that we can interactively write down and simulate and perform computational neuroscience with a third possibility is that it's the brain is reallythe evolved to realize that things in the world behave in the way we've been describing. It could plausibly be a mechanism or variation inference type approaches could be a mechanism that the brain has evolved to use to model its environment as well, which would bring back this idea of an explicit variation of energy."
"Speaker 4","01;45;22;21","01;45;49;21","And so I think there are several different possibilities. I think there's still probably an ongoing discussion about this. And for me, the idea of inference and variation inference has to be one where the tail divergence is decreasing over time, where it's not something that we necessarily keep static, and which might mean that variation inference is, is not something that's necessarily happening in the systems they've been describing."
"Speaker 4","01;45;49;21","01;46;08;04","Take them but whether it could be something that would be interpreted in terms of the flow of internal states towards the most likely value and other aspects of that, or whether it's negative approximation, I'm sure Karl will have other things to say on this because I'm not giving a definitive or a clear answer one way or the other here."
"Speaker 4","01;46;08;24","01;46;31;17","And the ME variation occurs when the count of missions is shrinking and however, you could also argue that's marginal. Likely it's not composition of margin. Likely is itself a former basement prince and more akin to sort of model selection certainly feeds into the idea of activity in terms of acting upon the world to maximize the difference between model and world."
"Speaker 4","01;46;31;17","01;46;33;12","And that that element is certainly there."
"Speaker 1","01;46;36;10","01;46;51;13","Excellent Harold and then Blue will each have a last thought and next week at the same time we'll continue with 45.2. But for now Carl and then Blue are last thoughts on what Thomas just added or anything else."
"Speaker 3","01;46;53;01","01;47;31;10","I think he's absolutely right. I mean, it's more interesting to ask the question, isn't it? I think it's largely from the point of view of the way the world works. I think it's the AP interpretation is largely teleological window dressing, but I think it's incredibly useful to have that cheap and cheerful and doable kind of window dressing when you actually want to build artifacts that behave as creatures who are sort of poetic and have a homeostasis and have make the right kinds of decisions awesome first."
"Speaker 1","01;47;31;21","01;47;35;08","Thomas or Carl, any last thoughts? And then Blue, then I'll close."
"Speaker 4","01;47;39;07","01;47;42;21","Just say thank you for organizing this in your writings to be part of it."
"Speaker 2","01;47;46;05","01;47;59;22","Blue Yeah. It was great to have you guys here and I definitely have some questions that I've been wondering about for a long time resolved. So that was really great."
"Speaker 1","01;48;01;25","01;48;25;03","Yes, this was an excellent discussion, and we sometimes think about the zero as almost like preparing the marble. I don't know if it's blowing it out of glass or just bringing it to the edge of the bathtub and the dot zero. We just walk through in the order as it was laid out and try to follow the traces and understand some of the causal dynamics at play behind the writing."
"Speaker 1","01;48;25;16","01;48;55;19","And then in the Dark One, we're in kind of like this plane. And so there's little micro variations and local sense to be made. But I really appreciated how we opened up a lot of threads and also covered a lot of the key aspects of the paper. And then we'll be looking forward to the data when we get to climb or descend or circle ambulate and continue the discussion so thanks again to Karl and Thomas and all the other authors for this great paper."
"Speaker 1","01;48;55;19","01;48;59;15","And thank you, Blue and Brok for the zero. See you next week."
"Speaker 1","01;49;01;28","01;49;02;07","Bye."
