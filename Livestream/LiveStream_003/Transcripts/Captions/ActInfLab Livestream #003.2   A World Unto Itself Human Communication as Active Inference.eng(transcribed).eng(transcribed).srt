00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,360
we'll get

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
right into it this is team com 3.5

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
welcome to team com for our first time

15

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
listeners this is a recorded

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
and archived live stream we as team com

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
are an experiment in online team

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
communication and learning related to

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
active inference

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
you can reach us through twitter email

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
our public key base team or our youtube

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
channel

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,559
we welcome all skills backgrounds and

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,920
perspectives

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,119
and we ask for our conversions to

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,439
use good online video chat etiquette to

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,320
be respectful

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
muting and raising your hands and also

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
everyone please provide us with feedback

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,040
so we can

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
improve our work today in

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
active inference stream number 3.5 which

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
is a follow-up to number three

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
discussing the same paper

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
we're going to have a quick check check

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
in and warm up as usual

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
and then we'll return to our discussion

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
of the paper

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
and we've obtained a bunch of follow-up

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,000
questions

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
from ourselves and some colleagues and

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
we've sorted them loosely into

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
a couple of categories and we'll be able

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,960
to take

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
questions about any topic but the slides

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
are somewhat organizing the questions

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
into topics of communication

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
development attunement attention and

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
free energy itself

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
so as far as the check-in and warm-up

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,360
the first question

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,119
is what is an interesting type of

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
communication you've experienced or

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,479
maybe even thought about

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,840
in the previous week

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
um for me it was a meeting with my

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
relatives what i didn't had a chance

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
to see about for half a year before

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
because of koid and so on so his

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,280
last weekend was quite happy meeting

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,840
with relatives and some kind of

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
discussion and so it's an attunement

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,720
between us after a long time

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,040
cool and maybe either ivan or shannon in

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
related to that answer

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
how has going remote or just this

68
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
situation of

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
the past year influenced your style of

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
communication or relating

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
sure so yesterday we had our first

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,840
meeting of our graduate student group

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
and we had about 40 people in one zoom

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,879
room

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,640
and after a whole summer of seeing maybe

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
four or five different faces

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,760
on a screen and being able to make sure

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,519
eye contact with whoever you're talking

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
to um

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
yesterday was a bit of a bombardment of

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
like visual sensory information

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
like searching for the person who was

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
speaking and

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
trying to tune out like the extra

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,959
movements or

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
drinks of a water bottle or like

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,000
someone's

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
pet on screen while also trying to pay

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
attention to if someone had like a nod

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,840
or raised their actual

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
physical hand in a video it was

92
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
definitely an adjustment like

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,120
oh i was a lot more conscious of

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
all of the interactions of everyone on

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
the screen than i would have been had we

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
been in a room

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,239
in person

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
yeah there's big differences between

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
being with three people in a room and

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
and 40 people in a room and so it

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
shouldn't be surprising that there's

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
differences between the kind of smaller

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,480
video chat that we're having here and

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
then the larger scale rooms but it's

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
really hard to stay on top of everything

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
when we don't get the full information

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,720
and then

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
i guess a last general question what is

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
something that

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
is new that you've experienced or

111
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
learned about this week

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,199
if anyone has thoughts or we can just

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,479
continue

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,639
yvonne i i can tell that

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
in our company we have a frequent

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
meeting each monday morning we discuss

117
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,799
about work issues and

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,560
this week i

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
i saw that the meeting goes

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
different when different number of

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
people

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,400
um

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
different number of people

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
involved in in this meeting

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
and it's very interesting

126
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
why people who

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,280
who is absent now how do they

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,119
influence the meeting

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,680
and maybe they don't know

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,800
about that they influence yeah

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,759
of while they are absent

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,880
interesting yeah with organizations

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,919
people can have

134
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
influence whether they're in the room or

135
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,800
not so sometimes the communication

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,280
ecology of the meeting room includes

137
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,840
like

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
people who are in a different room

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,039
fundamentally

140
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
and then also because communication is

141
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,759
so non-additive it's non-linear

142
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,280
if you have a certain outcome with

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
person abc and they have a dance party

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,360
and then you take away person c and

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,199
there's no dance party that doesn't mean

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,080
that person c

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
you know is the dance party it just

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
means there's some sort of emergent

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,639
outcome with the three people who were

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,199
there

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
and there's a different emerging outcome

152
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,479
when somebody isn't there

153
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
so how do we deal with that this

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
non-linearity of communication

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,520
and maybe even this paper might have

156
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,000
some

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
ideas so we are continuing our

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,160
discussion

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
of vasel at all 2020 a world unto itself

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,639
human communication as active inference

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,120
and

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,840
last time in our stream number three we

163
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,240
went

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
over the goals the abstract the figures

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
and a few of the big ideas

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
of the paper welcome sasha

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
this time we're going to be asking some

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
follow-up questions and having

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,720
continued discussion about the paper and

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,120
so

171
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,080
our first topic will be communication

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
and these were compiled

173
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,080
questions from a bunch of people who

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
submitted them to us

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,440
or some things that we wanted to address

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
in the first stream but didn't get a

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,280
chance

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
so anyone is welcome to pop in with

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
whatever they want to say about one of

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
the questions or

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,120
uh follow up with an additional question

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
but we'll just release them one by one

183
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
so we can stay um

184
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,080
at least on topic with what we're

185
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
talking about up

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,319
maybe not here let's go to the first one

187
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,919
so i think this was alex your

188
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,360
question there's cooperative competitive

189
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
or adversarial

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,280
communication and there's other kinds of

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
communication too possibly

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
so what are the kinds of communication

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
that can be identified

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
and how

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
what made you ask this question or what

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
what would be interesting to know about

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
this

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
because the paper

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
the paper what we are reading is about

200
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,639
uh

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,879
cooperative communication and everything

202
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
is about it

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
but also it mentioned that it's possible

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,479
and it's

205
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
really true it's it's possible what

206
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
communication could be competitive in

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
some situation

208
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,639
between two people between teams

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,319
and the question is what our types

210
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,199
could be to be identified maybe some

211
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,160
kind of

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
mix of these two types and

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
in case when communication is happening

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,720
how it is possible maybe to understand

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
if it's really cooperative or it's

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,559
changed in competitive in some moment

217
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,159
great question and is cooperative

218
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,880
communication

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,039
about the ends if it results in

220
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
cooperative behavior

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
is that cooperative communication or

222
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
does cooperative communication

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,560
entail turn-taking and feeling of

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,360
cooperation

225
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
because the feeling of cooperation and

226
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
turn-taking can be

227
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,920
hijacked or used non-cooperatively let's

228
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,519
just say

229
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
and then the sort of allswell that

230
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
enswell approach

231
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
might excuse some extremely

232
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
inappropriate communication

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
mechanics in service of the cooperative

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
end goal but who's cooperative end goal

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
and how are they defining that

236
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
so it's a big question like do we define

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
communication

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,959
by the mechanism and the details of the

239
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
conversation itself or do we define it

240
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,440
by the context

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
so if we uh consider it for uh

242
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,000
from some again from an engineering

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
point

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,720
now we need to have some kind of

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
approaches to manage communication

246
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
and to control it during its way

247
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
to have predicted

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
or expect results from it

249
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,920
yep and i think that the general message

250
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
passing or information sharing

251
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
frameworks

252
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
are almost broader than cooperation

253
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
itself the

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
communication outline that's uh inactive

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,440
inference

256
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
could be between a person and a tiger

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,480
and

258
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
that whether it's cooperative or not

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
could be kind of a lens that you apply

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,720
to it

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
but the signals are certainly moving

262
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
between the communicating agents

263
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
whether they think they're cooperating

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
or they actually are so

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
communication is sort of the the

266
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,519
fundamental

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
and then all these other adjectives get

268
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
layered on top depending on how we think

269
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,120
about that kind of communication

270
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
any other thoughts on that first part

271
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
so and if if somebody wants to they can

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
always jump back or

273
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
add non-sequiturs but we'll continue

274
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
yeah i wanted to

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
uh add briefly um and then thinking in

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,440
the context of

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
uh long-term collaboration um

278
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
it seems like communication would have

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
to um

280
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
have signs of cooperativity at every

281
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
stage along the way

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
because there is no end that is obvious

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,680
or

284
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
um you know if you want a long-term

285
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,519
collaboration

286
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,959
you don't want it to end because of a

287
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
miscommunication

288
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,519
and how to focus on

289
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,760
that kind of positive feedback without

290
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,880
sinking into

291
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
kind of the superficial um signs of

292
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,760
cooperation

293
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
of where people simply feel that it is

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,279
cooperative

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
nice good point this

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
second quote speaks to that a little bit

297
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
it says a single individual

298
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
is necessary to obtain a low risk

299
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
and low reward and then collaboration

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
appears as a riskier but

301
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
more rewarding option so this is kind of

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
within that

303
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,600
prisoner's dilemma type game theory

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,240
where

305
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
individuals are whether it's individual

306
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,279
cells or

307
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,079
eagles or birds or some other thing it's

308
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:56,480
being

309
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,639
phrased as a question of action for the

310
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,519
individual

311
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,920
whether they want to go their own way

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
whether that's considered defecting or

313
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
it's just the baseline state to be

314
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,800
individuated and obtained with a higher

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,040
probability a smaller reward

316
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
like i could work for ten dollars an

317
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
hour by myself

318
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,079
or collaboration um opens the door to

319
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:18,880
potentially

320
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
win-win collaborations where you make uh

321
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,399
on

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,079
average more than ten dollars an hour

323
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,920
because you worked with multiple people

324
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,519
and you allowed your specialization and

325
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,720
your perspectives to

326
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
contribute to your shared value however

327
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
it may be the case that

328
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
this collaboration is also riskier

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
and so i think alex again you asked what

330
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
types of risk can be identified

331
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,880
in a communicative setting and how could

332
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,920
we quantify

333
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,839
such risks especially if we were going

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
to quantify them using the way of

335
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,040
thinking of active inference

336
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,079
um yes uh again it's about for me

337
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
if we speak about collaboration and

338
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,839
collaboration is based on communication

339
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,519
and first risk is

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
not to have uh alignment

341
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,320
at the end of communication but what uh

342
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,279
possible kind of risks could be arised

343
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,240
additionally

344
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
for example to take

345
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
wrong direction for communication and

346
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
maybe if such kind of list could be

347
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
prepared

348
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
if there are any possible way to

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,959
quantify it

350
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
in terms of

351
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,040
active inference framework and in terms

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,360
of

353
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,839
i don't know

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
maybe some kind of epistemic values

355
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
or something like this

356
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,639
um to i have a bit of an addition to

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,040
that

358
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
um to to bring it back to fep

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
and minimization of uncertainty um

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
how do we determine kind of a good

361
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,000
enough alignment

362
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,720
like something that is appropriate for

363
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,760
the goal

364
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,320
um because you could imagine that

365
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,880
there's

366
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
collaborations where you don't feel very

367
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
aligned but it's a low stakes

368
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
situation and at the start and at the

369
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,079
end

370
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
you feel that you know your values or um

371
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
goals weren't really aligned but you

372
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
still did the task that you were

373
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
trying to do um and and perhaps that's

374
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,240
that's not

375
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
the best case scenario but it's a

376
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,320
realistic one

377
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
yep and de-risking communication so for

378
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
example

379
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
uh and there's many kinds of risks that

380
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
can be identified so maybe i'll

381
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
start with that like there's the risk

382
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
that you end up trusting somebody who

383
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,480
ends up

384
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
leaking your information or directly um

385
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
causing an action to you or to a project

386
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,760
that is deleterious

387
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
somebody who causes your time to be

388
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,199
spent inefficiency

389
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
inefficiently um there's all these kinds

390
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,320
of

391
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
risks of biting off a bigger chunk with

392
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
the help of a team

393
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
but then the chunk that you bite off is

394
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
the wrong one or you fail to bite off

395
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
the chunk if it is the right one

396
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
and then how do we quantify so much i

397
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,120
like that

398
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
idea alex of course sort of like a

399
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
checklist manifesto

400
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
but from the active inference potential

401
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
uh potential

402
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,839
uh applications and asking

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
more specifically uh what what kinds of

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
things can we discuss as a team

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
that reduce our uncertainty about this

406
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,839
and this and this

407
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
and i think that's definitely one of the

408
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,600
directions we're moving so maybe we can

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
keep that kind of question in mind

410
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
and think about what are these best

411
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,880
practices for teams at

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,519
the onset or in the middle or in the

413
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,480
closing of

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,600
even a little phase of their

415
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,480
collaboration what are these questions

416
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
or provocations that teams could take on

417
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,839
that would de-risk their communication

418
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,839
and improve the throughput

419
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,360
potentially in a way that could be

420
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
lending itself towards being formalized

421
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
yeah i have a thought on that um this

422
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
kind of sounds

423
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
like the uh the grace's maxims

424
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,199
where um what you say like in

425
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,240
communication

426
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
one maximum is like relevance it needs

427
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
to be relevant to

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
um the conversation or to whatever

429
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
you're referring to

430
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
um and i think it's either quantity or

431
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,120
quality where you

432
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
need to say just enough that your

433
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
message gets across

434
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,519
but not too much um and this is like

435
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,800
also something that you're

436
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
inferring on your communicative partner

437
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,720
very cool i looked up these uh grice's

438
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,399
maxims

439
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,839
g-r-i-c-e is the last name and the four

440
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
of them just to

441
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
clarify the maxim of quantity which is

442
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
be as informative as you possibly can

443
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
without any more information than needed

444
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
the maxim of quality

445
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
which is being truthful and not giving

446
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,600
information that's false or not

447
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
supported by evidence

448
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
the maxim of relation where one tries to

449
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:01,920
be relevant

450
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
and say things that are pertinent to

451
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
discussion and then the maxim

452
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
of manner is the fourth and last one

453
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,959
where one tries to be

454
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
clear brief and orderly without

455
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,640
obscurity or ambiguity

456
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
so these are really interesting it

457
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,839
reminds me of

458
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
the truth the whole truth nothing but

459
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,880
the truth from the

460
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,679
justice system and also these are these

461
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,039
are great reminders

462
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,919
in all sorts of communication especially

463
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,400
ones

464
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
that are potentially recorded or for a

465
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
consumption

466
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
where the kinds of vocal pauses that

467
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
are played off as irrelevancies in

468
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,799
conversation

469
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,360
become magnified a lot and good public

470
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
speaking is a challenge because

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,520
having these cognitive maxims at the top

472
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,240
of our mind

473
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
prevents us from thinking the topic

474
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
itself unless it's a situation

475
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,360
thankfully where you're talking about

476
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
the maximums themselves

477
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,280
so it's hard to speak directly and with

478
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,080
high uh

479
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,480
relevantness and quality and

480
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,120
quantitativity

481
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
when all these other things are

482
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
happening so very

483
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
interesting connection there and it

484
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
would be a way to de-risk communication

485
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
by using these maxims

486
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
so third point here communicative

487
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,720
constructions

488
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
we'll just use cc are patterned pairings

489
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
of form and meaning

490
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
could we formally join communicative

491
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
constructions with narrative and

492
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
ontologies

493
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
or what other kinds of cc could we use

494
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,440
yeah as for this question is uh

495
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,679
communicative construction uh looks like

496
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
uh well well-developed uh area

497
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,160
and it's defines uh pairing

498
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,559
of forms and meaning so it could be

499
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
different forms

500
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
and it's always i think connect to some

501
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
meaning

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
and as we develop in our

503
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
directions and discuss his narratives

504
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,000
and

505
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
ontologies if we'll find a way to

506
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,360
joint it with uh communicative

507
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,919
construction and define it this way

508
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
it could be more useful to discuss with

509
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
other parties

510
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,320
so and the next uh step is

511
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
what our types of construction

512
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
could we see or defined or find

513
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,200
else to be formal

514
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,039
so we could use it in more efficient way

515
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
nice it reminds me of just regular

516
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
constructions and there are specific

517
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
kinds of constructions there's bridges

518
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
and doorways and

519
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
all these things and sometimes there's

520
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,760
overlap or there's an object that's a

521
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,160
chair

522
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
and a bridge because you can sit on it

523
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,120
but the point is they're still

524
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,080
constructed

525
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
and so when we're talking about

526
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
communicative constructs

527
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,880
like turn taking or these other like

528
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
what is a bridge

529
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
for communication what are these

530
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
constructs that are

531
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,679
not just there in nature waiting to be

532
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,200
discovered but what are these constructs

533
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,039
that we're going to implement in the

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,679
world

535
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
ideally to get from here to there to get

536
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
from not knowing to

537
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
knowing and what are these constructs

538
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
and what would be an ontology

539
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
or a framework for the knowledge to

540
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
discuss these kinds of constructs

541
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,000
instead of just saying well it's a

542
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
discussion there's no more detail i can

543
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
provide then it's a discussion

544
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
are there types of discussion are there

545
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
types of dialogue that might be able to

546
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
be more useful in one place or another

547
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,400
just like a bridge would make sense here

548
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
but not here

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
so cool question and then last question

550
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
on the communication slide

551
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,080
there was a note about diversification

552
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
of communicative systems

553
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
across time space and speaker

554
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,799
communities

555
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,200
as well as species we could add which

556
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,559
communication systems

557
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,360
can be identified in relationship to

558
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
teams and organizations

559
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
yes and again for me it's open question

560
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,000
and

561
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
trying to see perspective to

562
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
have this uh

563
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,880
approach to describe

564
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,159
possible way and possible communication

565
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:10,880
systems

566
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
what could be useful for teams and

567
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
organization

568
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,320
and here as we see is related to time

569
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
and space

570
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
and so it could be about time scales

571
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,440
and uh organization also could be

572
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,799
possible like space

573
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,559
and could be present in different

574
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,840
countries so we still need to

575
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,960
have options to communicate and so

576
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
define system

577
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
in use for it

578
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,600
so it's directions for future

579
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,720
development of our work

580
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
cool any other notes on that

581
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,919
just from the chat and this was in

582
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,440
response i believe to something

583
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
that sasha mentioned about how good is

584
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,679
good enough for the team

585
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,400
rj wrote because there are opportunities

586
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
for signal error

587
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
can the longevity of cooperation be

588
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
assessed by goodness of fit between

589
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
self-reporting of participants concerns

590
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,559
about risk of miscommunication and so

591
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,000
this is a pretty meta

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
comment it's asking instead of a let's

593
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,440
say an annual

594
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,600
progress checkup on how happy or how

595
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
satisfied and if the satisfaction is

596
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,080
going up

597
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
then it's getting better if the

598
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
satisfaction's going down it's getting

599
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,440
worse

600
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
this is like asking the participants to

601
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,520
self-report

602
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,640
on their perception of the risk of

603
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
miscommunication

604
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,320
and so you could ask the employee how

605
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,600
well do you think

606
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,679
the communication channel is between you

607
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
and your supervisor or vice versa

608
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,880
and then by potentially uh maintaining

609
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
the longevity of the group

610
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
which is a success in and of itself

611
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
because of the many opportunities

612
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
for failure of groups beyond longevity

613
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
we could actually

614
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,280
improve the self-report of the precision

615
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,799
of the communication

616
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,600
rather than trying to do this ultimately

617
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,240
futile

618
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,320
optimization on satisfaction because

619
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,440
that's a moving target

620
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
but something that we can latch on to is

621
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
precise communication

622
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
and precise communication within the

623
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,640
context of an aligned

624
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
narrative for the team or the

625
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
organization would

626
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
ultimately potentially lead to

627
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
satisfaction so interesting

628
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,039
point by rj any thoughts before we move

629
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
forward

630
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,280
cool so this is what you all came here

631
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,159
for

632
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,840
someone was told there would be baby

633
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
pictures on the stream

634
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,080
here's a quote from the paper to get us

635
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,279
thinking about

636
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,200
development they wrote human infants

637
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
only appear satisfied following a

638
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
communicative bid

639
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,159
when their own communicative partner has

640
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,679
aligned their mental states with their

641
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,080
own

642
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
with respect to the infant's intended

643
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,440
referent and some

644
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,240
citations there to follow so what does

645
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,640
that

646
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
quotation mean or what does anyone think

647
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,840
about that

648
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
here's the questions that we can ask

649
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,679
about development

650
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,520
um the first question is how or when

651
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
does a child learn to align mental

652
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
states to satisfy communicative bids

653
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,480
the second question and what we can you

654
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,440
wanna

655
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
does anyone have thoughts on the first

656
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,039
question

657
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,840
um yeah i

658
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,879
um kind of as a corollary to um

659
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,440
yeah as i was reading it i was really

660
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
trying to parse through

661
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,240
the development of this process um uh

662
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,320
like the the ontogeny of it and

663
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
because there is

664
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,480
a maturation of how cooperative

665
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
communication happens

666
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,679
that um

667
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
there should also be a start when you

668
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,720
learn to align your mental states

669
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,559
but of course upon reading the paper

670
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,159
again and um

671
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,640
you know working through all the baby

672
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,600
references

673
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,600
um the author states that

674
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,720
you never actually learn to do this

675
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,840
process it's part of the

676
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
adaptive priors for alignment that

677
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
humans are endowed with

678
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,360
so um perhaps i can already answer that

679
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
first question

680
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,080
so what the answer is how or when uh the

681
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
when it sounds like

682
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,919
it's continuous it's always a continuous

683
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,960
process

684
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
and then how is kind of the broad

685
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,720
topic of development how does language

686
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
develop how does culture develop

687
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
and then i thought the point that you

688
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
made about in

689
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
evolutionary prior is very good and it's

690
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
also a challenging

691
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
question to ask what exactly this prior

692
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
is and that's why so much of the paper

693
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,039
is about it

694
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,120
because it's pretty clear that we don't

695
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,159
have a prior

696
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,480
for any specific language in the sense

697
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
that a baby who

698
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,240
is growing up around no language will

699
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,120
fail to develop

700
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,840
uh linguistic capabilities in this same

701
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,480
whereas

702
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
any child raised in a different

703
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,919
linguistic setting will take on

704
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
that language so there's a prior that

705
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
language will be

706
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,760
communicated but it's almost a prior

707
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,679
that's above the level of the specific

708
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,640
language

709
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,559
yet there seem to be things about our

710
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,919
evolutionary prior

711
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,960
like grammar or structure or certain

712
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
types of logical relationships that are

713
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
harder

714
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,600
um to change shannon

715
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
not to be contrarian but i'm going to be

716
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
a little contrarian

717
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,200
is um we talk a lot about um language or

718
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,799
maybe there's some innate prior that

719
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,080
will develop

720
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
language but there's something that

721
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
happens even before language and that's

722
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,120
the rhythm

723
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,080
of development like in the womb so you

724
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
have these bipedal

725
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
rhythms of the mothers walking you have

726
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,320
rhythms of the heartbeat breathing

727
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,200
rhythms

728
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,880
and these are these like very embodied

729
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
forms of not necessarily communication

730
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,000
at that stage but it is signaling

731
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,080
um to the infant in the womb like

732
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,559
whether the situation is

733
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,200
stressful or not for the mother and thus

734
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,760
for the

735
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
um uh not yet or an infant and then once

736
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,240
you're born you're holding the infant

737
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,679
there's a lot of you know skin-to-skin

738
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,240
contact so you're still maintaining this

739
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
um not quite communication but this

740
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
balance of the mother's

741
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
heart rhythms or breathing rhythms to

742
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,559
the infants and then slowly

743
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
externalizing that

744
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,440
to um gaze relationships or

745
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
to like when you're playing with the

746
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
baby's hands you know you're holding

747
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
their hands maybe moving them

748
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,559
and then slowly just externalizing these

749
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,640
rhythms into

750
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,159
more and more communicative acts and

751
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,919
less sort of direct embodied

752
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,480
relationships

753
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
cool yvonne

754
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,720
uh i wanted to say that toddlers

755
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,200
has have very

756
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,630
very limited

757
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,480
[Music]

758
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,159
limited set of mental states

759
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,080
and to to align

760
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,159
with its

761
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,559
state

762
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
their vis-a-vis

763
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
came to do this alignment

764
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
more simple rather than

765
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,520
we talk about all the people who

766
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,279
has more broad

767
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,120
mental states more more broad set of

768
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,559
their internal states

769
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
yep and we can come back to that when we

770
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,399
get to the attunement

771
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,279
question shannon i i really liked how

772
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,159
you described

773
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,520
the continuum from the really the

774
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000
communication that is related to rhythm

775
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,440
of the heart and the intrigue maybe

776
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
circadian rhythms in the blood

777
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
so very slow rhythms and rhythms that

778
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,279
are transmitted through

779
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,080
tactile stimulus through the womb as

780
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,279
well as chemical or

781
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,320
neural type relationships and then it's

782
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,399
like this gradual disconnection

783
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,919
where as the physical touch is replaced

784
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,200
by the gaze

785
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,760
and then adults tend to have more of a

786
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,720
barrier

787
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,520
physically between them at least that's

788
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
coming from a culturally specific

789
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
place but maybe it still does hold it's

790
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,880
rare to see adults

791
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
touching each other as much as for

792
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,360
example a mother and an infant

793
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
and so this second question how does it

794
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,480
relate

795
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,399
this development of communication

796
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
through these different modalities

797
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,679
and from things that barely seem

798
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,279
communicative things that almost seem

799
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,399
physiological

800
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,320
but then in the end if we're

801
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,159
communicating about what's for dinner

802
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
isn't that also a physiological

803
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
communication that reduces our

804
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
uncertainty about where nutrition is

805
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,720
coming from

806
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
so is it that different than a uh

807
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,880
pre-linguistic

808
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
cry for milk and then how does it relate

809
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,480
to this

810
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,399
way in which adults understand each

811
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,600
other

812
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,279
and then it reminds me also of these

813
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,720
different modalities of

814
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,880
therapy um and even thinking about like

815
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
maslow's hierarchy of needs

816
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,360
the idea that the end-all be-all is the

817
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,799
linguistic expression

818
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
i'm sorry or uh i'm happy that's kind of

819
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,279
the tip of the iceberg

820
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,240
for linguistically capable adults but

821
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,960
what is that

822
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
embodied iceberg what is the actual

823
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,799
thing

824
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,960
that we're trying to communicate what's

825
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,039
the territory not just the linguistic

826
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,760
map

827
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,279
and then how does this relate to the

828
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
communication or other issues that

829
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,559
adults have

830
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,799
and we want to work it out and then are

831
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,000
we going to use our words

832
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,360
are we going to use our uh lower

833
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
levels of the massless hierarchy lower

834
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
chakras we get physical

835
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
for better or for worse

836
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,679
and just to get to the last question on

837
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,640
this development

838
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
slide what are some linguistic

839
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,000
characteristics

840
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,440
of cooperative communication

841
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,480
this this relates a bit to earlier our

842
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,200
discussion

843
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,679
about is cooperative communication

844
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,919
characterized by the mechanics

845
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,320
like polite turn taking or relevant

846
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
sharing of information

847
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
are they defined by the end goal so

848
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
cooperative communication

849
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,039
is all's well that ends well or is it

850
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,760
something

851
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,080
uh else like something ethical or

852
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,039
something normative

853
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
like cooperative communication is when

854
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,360
you follow those four maxims of good

855
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,399
communication

856
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,000
even if you're impolite about it or it

857
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,159
leads to a non-cooperative end

858
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,480
for who as long as you abide by these

859
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,840
conversational rules

860
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,120
then it's going to be a cooperative

861
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,440
communication

862
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
what what are some of these linguistic

863
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
characteristics if any or

864
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
what are the characteristics of

865
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
cooperative communication that go beyond

866
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,640
linguistics

867
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,880
cool oh go ahead sasha um

868
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,919
yeah kind of

869
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,519
well yeah sort of relevant to this

870
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,279
question but the the first

871
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,760
uh question on the side made me think

872
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,840
about

873
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,760
um other

874
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,559
alternative

875
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,080
states or abilities of communication

876
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,760
so that children who

877
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,880
grow up not being able to hear or

878
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,760
speak or see for any number of

879
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,279
all right looks like we had a brief

880
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,559
little disrupt

881
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,519
and so i'm just going to send a link to

882
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,279
get the rest of our colleagues back

883
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,399
into here while they

884
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,000
are getting back in i'm going to go back

885
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,320
to

886
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
sharing our screen so we were just

887
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,159
having

888
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,200
sasha talking about

889
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,720
the developmental characteristics

890
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,720
of cooperative communication and

891
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,840
yes yep sorry something definitely did

892
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
go wrong there but

893
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,279
we're on part two of three point five

894
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,080
three point five

895
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,360
two celavi and

896
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,799
uh we are continuing on the

897
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
development slide and well as people

898
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,840
join in we'll be ready to move

899
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
on yep sasha something definitely

900
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
blipped a little bit uh alex if you

901
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,519
could message

902
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,279
shannon just to make sure that she knows

903
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,799
that we'll use this link

904
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,239
we are back live so continuing with

905
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,800
what you were saying about the

906
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
linguistics and cooperation

907
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
it's like you knew i was gonna say

908
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,440
something wrong so it cut me off

909
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,320
um um

910
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,599
yeah so to that point i i think the

911
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,119
linguistic characteristics

912
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,159
um at the very least would look like a

913
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,399
back and forth

914
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,560
such that the communication would be

915
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,918
happening

916
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,399
on multiple scales

917
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,639
that people are communicating but also

918
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,960
getting feedback within their short

919
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
glimpse of communication

920
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,599
and that kind of reminds me of the

921
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
um the checklist or the the multiple

922
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
scales of communication for teams that

923
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,560
we brought up earlier

924
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,160
but maybe that's kind of like the baby

925
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,000
steps of developing

926
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,119
communication yep

927
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,160
cool and alex you've

928
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
sent the uh message thank you

929
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,480
so let's get to the question of

930
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,599
attunement and whenever

931
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,079
she rejoins we'll just hop in so here's

932
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,119
a quotation

933
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,640
from the paper the hypothesis here

934
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,880
is then that repeated couplings between

935
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
infants and children

936
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,480
with adults and more experienced peers

937
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
may cause the prior beliefs of

938
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
inexperienced

939
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,599
individuals to converge more towards the

940
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,359
hidden causes generating

941
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,000
sensory consequences i.e the mental

942
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,839
states of more experienced others

943
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,960
rather than the other way around that is

944
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,520
coupled action perception cycles in such

945
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,320
dyads

946
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
tend to be characterized by an

947
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,200
asymmetric entrainment of prior beliefs

948
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,520
what does this mean what is the most

949
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
just foundational interpretation

950
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,680
of this question and then how does this

951
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,320
relate maybe to the infant adult

952
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,440
dyad communication

953
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
i'll just start with the base

954
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,920
interpretation so we're talking about

955
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
hey shannon welcome back sorry about

956
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
that we're talking about

957
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,880
these communicative dyadic situations

958
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,000
between two or multiple agents

959
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,839
and we're referring to one of the

960
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,359
individuals as

961
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,280
more experienced and one of them as

962
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
relatively inexperienced

963
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
in the context of some niche so it isn't

964
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,240
that one

965
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,160
is closer to absolute truth that's not

966
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,680
that babies are closer to absolute truth

967
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,040
it's not that the adult is closer to

968
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,000
absolute truth

969
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
it's that one of these individuals has

970
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,079
had more experience in in a

971
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
certain informational niche and also

972
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,480
might have a higher degree of precision

973
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
on their beliefs and that could be an

974
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,240
example of this evolutionary

975
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,839
hyper prior which is like the

976
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,760
temperature on decision making

977
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,480
of a young person starts high so you

978
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
could tell them

979
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,800
yep the sky is like a fabric and the sun

980
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,720
is carried by a chariot

981
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
and that explains it reduces their

982
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,640
uncertainty about the path of the sun in

983
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,520
the sky

984
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,480
and so potentially that is taken up by

985
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,280
the younger

986
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,000
uh or the more inexperienced individual

987
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,520
whereas somebody who had very high

988
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,359
precision on what the sun was

989
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,760
um whether they thought it was a car or

990
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,920
a nuclear reactor or something

991
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,640
that person is going to be harder to

992
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,119
move

993
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
into a new narrative and so when you

994
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
have an experienced and an inexperienced

995
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,839
individual or for that matter a stubborn

996
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,000
and an open-minded individual

997
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
because of the asymmetries you're going

998
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,240
to get this type of asymmetric

999
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,480
uh this differential outcome through the

1000
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,520
communication

1001
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
and here it's being described as the

1002
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,520
inexperienced individual converging to

1003
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,320
the priors

1004
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
of the experienced one and not vice

1005
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,760
versa so any

1006
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,640
thoughts on that one

1007
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,520
and this relates to figure 5a which we

1008
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,400
discussed in our last discussion but

1009
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,359
here we have

1010
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,079
the two birds the relatively experienced

1011
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,839
one and the inexperienced one

1012
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,640
and here experience is represented by a

1013
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
higher value of this order parameter on

1014
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
the y-axis

1015
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,359
such that a high level of experience in

1016
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,640
singing

1017
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,160
is correlated with a high order

1018
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
parameter reflecting a

1019
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
a very accurate ability to perform turn

1020
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,280
taking

1021
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,079
and that would relate to optimal flow of

1022
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,760
information if the turn taking were

1023
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,320
optimal

1024
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
like if one person started talking right

1025
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,640
when the other person stopped talking

1026
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,240
and then when we're in this learning

1027
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,079
alone paradigm with the shaded

1028
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,480
confidence intervals of the two birds we

1029
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,599
see that the order

1030
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,680
paradigm how order the two birds are

1031
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
relative to each other

1032
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,760
just drops off as a function of bouts of

1033
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,720
communication

1034
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
and we were thinking about this like the

1035
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
two recording studios

1036
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
the two individuals are singing a call

1037
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,520
and response song but they're not

1038
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
synchronized

1039
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
and so through their singing they end up

1040
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
desynchronizing through no fault of

1041
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,520
their own

1042
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,920
however when you're having a sensory

1043
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,960
coupling

1044
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,839
and a deep prior that you want to be

1045
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,160
aligned with your conversant or with

1046
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,839
your communicative partner

1047
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,599
that's learning together you need the

1048
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,160
sensory coupling and you also need this

1049
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
prior that you want to be aligned on

1050
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,960
your mindset

1051
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,760
and then we see that the blue line

1052
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,400
becomes

1053
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,760
asymmetrically entrained more to the

1054
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
green line than the other way around and

1055
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,280
we talked about that how the green line

1056
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
looks a little bit like it's going down

1057
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
almost like the blue line induces uh

1058
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
somewhat of a disordering

1059
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,000
of the green line and we asked whether

1060
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,839
that was reflected or not by the kinds

1061
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,359
of communications that we see with

1062
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,400
adults and with humans

1063
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
um any thoughts on this a two-minute

1064
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
slide we have one more attunement slide

1065
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,880
sash uh yeah uh thank you for explaining

1066
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,400
that that was a

1067
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,119
my question in understanding this uh

1068
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,920
rather

1069
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
long sentence and just getting to

1070
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,440
um why

1071
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
it is building towards the um

1072
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,920
the state of the more more experienced

1073
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,400
uh

1074
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,640
partner rather than the other way around

1075
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,599
because

1076
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,720
um yeah and

1077
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,480
and adding in the the precision of

1078
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,040
an open mindedness versus stubbornness

1079
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
that really helps to

1080
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,160
um kind of help better understand why

1081
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,599
it's uh moving

1082
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,280
in one direction versus the other

1083
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,440
because it's um

1084
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,680
the parameter like in this graph is not

1085
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,920
just an arbitrary value of how much

1086
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,800
you're like one

1087
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,319
thing or another but it's about your

1088
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,160
precision

1089
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,319
on what you're doing

1090
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,800
shannon yeah um to follow up on that

1091
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,079
there's also

1092
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,440
like if this was a graph um that was

1093
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
showing oscillations around the steady

1094
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,119
state instead of um

1095
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
the graph that it is like you might

1096
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,280
actually see smaller oscillations in

1097
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,640
this top

1098
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,720
partner because they're they're sort of

1099
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,119
converging on a steady state already

1100
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,119
and this blue partner might have like

1101
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,440
very wide oscillations until they start

1102
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,079
to find

1103
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,520
the similar steady state

1104
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,720
yes definitely true this is averaged out

1105
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,119
and has the confidence interval but then

1106
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,800
in the context of real

1107
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,640
learning or potentially niche

1108
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,119
entrainment it's not just this

1109
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
by step there's periods of stasis and oh

1110
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,440
i get it and then you jump up it's a

1111
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,079
quantum

1112
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,480
change in comprehension or there's an

1113
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,359
overshoot

1114
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,200
somebody oh they were too eager on this

1115
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,119
one and then they go too far to the

1116
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:45,920
other side

1117
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,960
but then we're able to look at the error

1118
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,760
residual

1119
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
and then hopefully reducing the error

1120
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
is what gets us to precision so a cool

1121
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,079
way to

1122
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
see it here visually let's think a

1123
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,240
little bit more about

1124
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,119
attunement with this other quote from

1125
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,079
the paper

1126
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,040
they wrote human individuals appear

1127
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,079
characteristically

1128
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,160
i.e species typically we can discuss

1129
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,680
that to be endowed

1130
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,000
with an adaptive prior that one's mental

1131
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,160
states are aligned with those of con

1132
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
specifics

1133
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
what does that mean just what is the

1134
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
first level interpretation of that

1135
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,920
sentence and then

1136
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,640
what about our priors are adaptive can

1137
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:24,960
they

1138
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,760
go wrong and then um what about that is

1139
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,839
species typical with respect to humans

1140
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,839
any thoughts there and i also added

1141
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,599
in a replicate of the capheim

1142
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
figure about tin bergens for questions

1143
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,040
just a reminder that we're always

1144
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
thinking about these multiple versions

1145
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,359
of

1146
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,800
why at the same time so why do humans do

1147
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,079
x or why does x appear in life

1148
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,920
these are questions that are going to

1149
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,839
have multiple kinds of answers

1150
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,000
so we're not looking for an exclusionary

1151
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,079
answer we want to understand

1152
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,160
whether our answer is actually striking

1153
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,920
at the level of causation

1154
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,280
of utility of ontogeny development

1155
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,319
or at the level of evolution itself

1156
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,040
so any thoughts on either responding

1157
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,800
within the context of one of these four

1158
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,160
squares or just what the sentence means

1159
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,400
so in differentiating human

1160
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,280
communication

1161
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,240
from non-human primate and other species

1162
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
in the paper

1163
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
what happened a lot was this discussion

1164
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,960
about the humans

1165
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,800
wanting to have their mental states

1166
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,480
aligned and we

1167
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,240
saw that in the previous quote like the

1168
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,839
baby isn't satisfied

1169
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,359
until the uh mental state is aligned

1170
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,720
until it believes that the mental state

1171
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,480
is aligned and i think it was shannon um

1172
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,440
who brought up

1173
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,599
this something where if somebody gets

1174
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,359
the right food for you from the grocery

1175
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,240
store but you think that they were

1176
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,920
misinformed about something else

1177
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,359
it's almost like it's not good enough

1178
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,119
for us to get what we asked for at the

1179
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,000
grocery store

1180
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,520
we really want to make sure that they

1181
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
also knew exactly

1182
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,680
at a deeper level why we were wanting

1183
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,400
that

1184
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,280
and so this question about the humans

1185
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,720
being

1186
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
uh endowed with a prior that we want to

1187
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,359
be aligned at a mental state level now

1188
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,560
i'll just first start with

1189
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,440
the species specific question i wonder

1190
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,880
if in a wolf pack

1191
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,319
or in uh an ant colony although one

1192
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
could debate to what extent these mental

1193
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,480
states are

1194
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,640
aware or something like that that's a

1195
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,520
little bit on the

1196
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,319
qualia end of the spectrum i would still

1197
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,040
say that

1198
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,839
in these groups be it insect or other

1199
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,200
mammals

1200
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,760
these individuals do benefit from having

1201
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,160
the mental state of the pack aligned

1202
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,040
and so in that respect i wonder if they

1203
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,119
also have an adaptive prior that their

1204
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,560
mental states would be aligned with con

1205
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,119
specifics

1206
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,839
that's actually interesting bringing up

1207
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,240
um like animals is intuitive

1208
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,560
um or wolf packs because we have dogs

1209
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,000
and we can see they try to align

1210
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,839
maybe something about their emotional

1211
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,359
state with

1212
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,280
their human owners or with other dogs

1213
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,640
you have in your house and you can see

1214
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,520
that

1215
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,960
maybe with wolves but when you bring up

1216
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,560
ants that's interesting

1217
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,160
because outside of like the movie

1218
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,880
ant-man don't really prescribe emotions

1219
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,160
to them

1220
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,760
um but there's definitely an alignment

1221
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
of

1222
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,760
their action states like in terms of

1223
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
which chemical pathways they're going to

1224
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,160
follow

1225
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,560
um and when they leave these chemical

1226
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,319
traces that say

1227
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,160
um there's definitely food here more and

1228
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,520
more ants travel there's more and more

1229
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
chemical traces and as the food's

1230
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,800
depleted the trace

1231
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,960
goes away so even though there's that

1232
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
really close physical proximity

1233
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,480
there's still some knowledge

1234
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,640
of the other instrumental states in

1235
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,000
their coordinated

1236
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,160
behavior and so it's it's interesting

1237
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
to kind of make that jump from behavior

1238
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,640
to actually ascribing

1239
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
i want my mental state to match yours in

1240
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,560
some way

1241
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,640
and the way that that gets manifested

1242
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
through feedback with the environment or

1243
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,040
stigmergy in the social insects

1244
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,880
the way that somebody might decorate a

1245
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,040
tea room and it's very serene

1246
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,440
it's like when you're in this space i i

1247
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,280
you know i want you to be synchronized

1248
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,920
on this

1249
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,839
mental alignment this is a sacred space

1250
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,520
or this is a messy spot

1251
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
and then similarly when you were just

1252
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,119
talking about the traces in the ant

1253
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,720
colony which fundamentally

1254
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,359
are serving to reduce the uncertainty of

1255
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,280
the colony about where to get food

1256
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,920
in that case and the way that the ants

1257
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,680
can communicate with each other

1258
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,200
is through direct touch tactile touch

1259
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,319
and olfaction

1260
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,119
as well as these long-term traces which

1261
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:45,599
can

1262
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,680
uh potentially generate something like

1263
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
collective mental state

1264
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,119
and so these are really interesting

1265
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
questions like does the worker

1266
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,720
have a prior is that the mental state

1267
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,800
that's being uh shared or

1268
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,280
doesn't want it to be shared or is it

1269
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,920
that

1270
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,240
individuals who act in a way that lead

1271
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,920
to coherent colonies

1272
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,319
we end up seeing them over evolutionary

1273
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,280
time more

1274
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
so it's almost independent of whether

1275
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
there's this experiential component

1276
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
to the adaptive prior it's almost

1277
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,119
whether it is

1278
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,960
adaptive is this sort of circular

1279
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,400
question kind of like survival of the

1280
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,960
fittest

1281
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,040
we're going to see packs of animals or

1282
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,440
packs of single cell bacteria or

1283
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,880
insects that end up having aligned and

1284
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,440
adaptive and effective communication

1285
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,960
and then what does that actually tell us

1286
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,079
because we're only going to see those

1287
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,359
systems persist

1288
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,920
we're only going to see communication as

1289
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,800
a dysfunction

1290
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,599
in mostly functional systems because

1291
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,079
things just didn't randomly show up here

1292
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,040
one way or the other

1293
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,440
i i think you nailed it with that

1294
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,400
statement that it's a circular argument

1295
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,480
in a way um i was thinking about that

1296
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,079
re-reading the paper as well

1297
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,599
it's like wow this sounds just too clean

1298
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,400
um like like it all it all kind of makes

1299
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,200
sense

1300
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,480
in the direction that this argument is

1301
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,280
going um

1302
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,400
and uh back to the point about um

1303
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,920
how we as humans interpret what other

1304
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,040
species are doing

1305
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,400
to be communicative uh cooperation

1306
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
or not is you know a whole nother

1307
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,079
question because

1308
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,359
um if if it's furthering their means um

1309
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,480
as a species then they're

1310
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,920
cooperating the right amount um

1311
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,960
there's a line about um how uh

1312
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,160
even great apes um they do

1313
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,280
pointing but in a way that's not um

1314
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,440
communicative cooperation but more

1315
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,800
selfish

1316
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,640
and i wonder if that's just kind of a

1317
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,559
human um

1318
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,839
our human species uh bias on

1319
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,880
how other species communicate not as

1320
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
good as we do

1321
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,440
yep and to bring this actually to

1322
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,400
narratives and

1323
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,680
narrative attunement the action patterns

1324
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,400
from a mechanical standpoint that humans

1325
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,960
are being

1326
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,760
asked to do by each other are too

1327
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,119
complicated to just be

1328
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,359
hard-coded or directly you can't say hey

1329
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,040
move your left hand a little bit up

1330
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
okay now go a little bit down now go

1331
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,480
back to where you were and go okay so

1332
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,440
you can't tell someone

1333
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,119
here's how you draw the letter a okay

1334
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,720
now here's how you draw the next letter

1335
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,040
you tell them the next level of would be

1336
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,079
write the word

1337
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,200
uh alexandra and then they're going to

1338
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,040
interpret that unpack that in their own

1339
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,280
way and then an even higher level of

1340
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,040
narrative attunement would be like

1341
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,760
i want you to do this or here's why it's

1342
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
important that you should do this

1343
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,280
and so if you can get people to be

1344
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,839
aligned at the here's why it's important

1345
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:44,480
to

1346
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,240
go out and do community service towards

1347
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,599
this end then

1348
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
they're going to figure out all the

1349
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
details with getting in and out of the

1350
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,040
car

1351
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,200
and turning left at the stoplight and

1352
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
coming to all these details

1353
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,920
that you would spend your whole life

1354
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,359
trying to micromanage

1355
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,920
if you can provide narrative attunement

1356
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
then each individual agent is going to

1357
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,000
unpack that in their own niche

1358
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
in a way that makes sense to them and so

1359
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
it's a very high leverage point

1360
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,920
to be able to specify and attune

1361
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,520
narratives because people who are

1362
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,280
narratively aligned with you

1363
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,520
will act in a similar way they'll

1364
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,200
respond to stimuli in a way that's

1365
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,720
similar to yourself or at least

1366
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,000
beneficial

1367
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,359
in a broad coalition and that's a um

1368
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,839
avenue or a vector for attunement of

1369
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,280
action in humans

1370
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,000
that is not as developed potentially in

1371
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,040
other species

1372
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,119
which comes back to this question about

1373
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,240
human-specific

1374
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,559
is it really human-specific to be having

1375
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,480
an adaptive prior that communication is

1376
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,359
useful

1377
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,960
well it's different in uh degree

1378
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
there's no other species with such an

1379
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,000
extent of digital or written

1380
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,040
communication

1381
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,520
but is it really different in type when

1382
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,960
we have turn taking

1383
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,599
rhythmic coordination across the animal

1384
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,960
and even non-animal

1385
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,720
kingdom so cool stuff there

1386
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,520
any thoughts on attention or attunement

1387
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,240
before we get to

1388
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,118
attention

1389
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,930
all right i just want to say maybe

1390
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,319
[Music]

1391
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,000
should we or is it possible to

1392
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,160
separate maybe for like a signal level

1393
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,839
and for i don't know content level

1394
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,960
so to have a good tournament

1395
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,240
you first for example need to exchange

1396
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
some kind of

1397
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,800
special signals to start the

1398
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,079
main part of this tournament

1399
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,480
yep and that relates to these ostentive

1400
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,280
cubes

1401
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,559
so if in a uh email the first

1402
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,280
line is to whom it may concern it's a

1403
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,800
relatively formal way

1404
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,119
it's saying this is a cue i'm showing

1405
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,880
you my hand right at the beginning i

1406
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,599
speak english

1407
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,240
i speak formally etc versus there's

1408
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,760
other ostensive cues

1409
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,839
that could attune somebody hey just a

1410
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,040
quick message

1411
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,640
um these are different cues and then

1412
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,720
there's the level of syntactic

1413
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,400
attunement that's making sure that the

1414
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,680
message comes across

1415
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,640
just from a bitwise perspective and then

1416
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,680
there's the semantic

1417
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,760
attunement the meaning of the message

1418
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,839
but of course the media is the message

1419
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,000
so there's like somewhat of a blurring

1420
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,880
between the

1421
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,520
um content and the delivery mechanism

1422
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,559
and then there's the narrative

1423
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,480
attunement which is at the highest level

1424
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,200
that goes beyond any single meme the

1425
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,760
jpeg or the words in it or whatever

1426
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,520
it's that higher level attunement that

1427
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
actually dictates how humans respond

1428
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,920
sasha

1429
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,640
i just wanted to comment a bit on the

1430
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,480
the

1431
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,400
what where do our priors go wrong and

1432
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
um if this is a bit of a meta comment uh

1433
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,800
maybe you'll see in the recording but

1434
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,920
um as we're working towards alignment um

1435
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,440
of mental states uh your video and audio

1436
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,720
are not aligned

1437
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,839
and um

1438
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,960
in the adaptive sense um or in the

1439
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,920
evolutionary sense like

1440
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,559
oh go ahead go ahead oh and

1441
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,480
in the evolutionary sense like i i want

1442
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,160
to make sure that uh your voice and

1443
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,720
video

1444
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,240
are aligned because that would never

1445
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,160
happen outside of a video chat

1446
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,480
but in a video chat i don't need to

1447
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,240
worry that they're offset

1448
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
because i'm listening to your voice for

1449
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,160
the content of what you're saying

1450
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,720
um so that those two things are not

1451
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,280
aligned

1452
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
is actually okay in this scenario but is

1453
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,319
still

1454
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,040
um concerning and draws my attention to

1455
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
that uh mismatch

1456
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,359
yep that's a deep prior that we've

1457
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,240
learned by

1458
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,160
communicating in person that definitely

1459
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,000
gets violated also people being

1460
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,520
pixelated in person i don't i don't

1461
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,800
remember that happening but

1462
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,920
it did happen from time to time so here

1463
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,559
on the

1464
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,319
attention question so here's another

1465
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,920
quote from the paper and i really liked

1466
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,880
this because it it brought a connection

1467
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,280
from so-called folk psychology or just

1468
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,920
everyday

1469
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,119
discussions of topics that are

1470
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,520
neurophysiological

1471
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,839
into what is going to be bringing us

1472
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,839
towards a more formal phrasing of the

1473
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,559
question

1474
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,280
they wrote in active inference the folk

1475
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,760
psychological term attention refers to

1476
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,160
two

1477
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,720
distinct but closely related phenomena

1478
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,920
the first one is

1479
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,240
epistemic value and the second one is

1480
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,920
precision weighting there's a citation

1481
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,720
there

1482
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,839
epistemic value salience or affordance

1483
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,599
is the component of policy selection

1484
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,720
just discussed

1485
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,559
it is the component of the value of

1486
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,040
policies that tracks how much a policy

1487
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
reduces uncertainty about the state of

1488
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,400
the world

1489
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,000
it provides a description of the folk

1490
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
psychological phenomena of actively

1491
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
orienting towards or

1492
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,760
turning one's attention to a certain

1493
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,079
modality or part of the sensory field

1494
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,119
for example through

1495
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,520
visual stockades that sample particular

1496
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,520
locations in visual space

1497
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,920
in short salience or epistemic

1498
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,599
affordance is an attribute of how we

1499
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,640
sample the world

1500
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,559
in the sense that actively sampling

1501
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,160
sensory information will reduce

1502
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,920
uncertainty in relation to our current

1503
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,720
beliefs

1504
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,640
in contrast this is the second type of

1505
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,119
attention precision is an attribute of

1506
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,799
sensory data per se

1507
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,599
of itself imprecise sensory data should

1508
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,520
have less effect on bayesian belief

1509
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,319
updating relative to precise information

1510
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,240
it is therefore important to afford the

1511
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,799
right precision to each sensory sample

1512
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,000
via precision weighting so

1513
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
here's the two questions i asked about

1514
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,359
this quote people can

1515
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,280
answer one of the questions or ask a

1516
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,599
further question about this paragraph or

1517
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,680
bring up their own interpretation how is

1518
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,119
this idea of attention

1519
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,760
related to ascent of cues and how is

1520
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,040
this idea of attention

1521
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,839
related to culture as an informational

1522
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,839
niche

1523
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,000
so first we can think about what are

1524
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
these two different kinds of attention

1525
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,079
because they talk about how there's two

1526
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,400
distinct but closely related phenomena

1527
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,079
so we're going to reduce our uncertainty

1528
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,160
about this term attention

1529
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,359
and it's broken down into two categories

1530
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,480
the epistemic

1531
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,400
value which relates to the value of

1532
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,839
knowledge and then

1533
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,440
precision weighting which is like the

1534
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,000
value of the sensory data itself

1535
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,720
and we can go to this last sentence to

1536
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,920
look at how they differ pretty

1537
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,880
specifically

1538
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,720
imprecise sensory data should have less

1539
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,799
effect on bayesian belief updating

1540
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,960
relative to precise information so let's

1541
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,240
imagine if someone says okay i'm going

1542
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,280
to turn on this tv

1543
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,559
and it's going to have the results of

1544
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,880
the election and you turn on the tv

1545
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,040
and it's just static now there's many

1546
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,000
kinds of static

1547
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,839
but the point is with respect to the

1548
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,440
question that you want to reduce your

1549
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,440
uncertainty about

1550
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,520
imprecise sensory data or if your eyes

1551
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,280
are very blurry or if you can't hear

1552
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
what the speaker is saying

1553
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,520
this kind of sensory data that's garbled

1554
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,000
shouldn't

1555
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,200
be used to update your beliefs about the

1556
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,680
world

1557
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,680
at a deep level so this is kind of

1558
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,960
getting to this question

1559
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,760
of uh the syntactic versus the semantic

1560
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,720
attunement

1561
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,040
because in the sense of precision

1562
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,000
waiting

1563
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,480
if you're paying attention to a stimulus

1564
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,520
in free energy

1565
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,920
that means that that stimulus is rising

1566
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,280
all the way up to the top of the

1567
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,079
attentional

1568
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,640
salience hierarchy uh in a sense it's

1569
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,720
really it's touching your deep priors

1570
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,480
in a way that's influencing them

1571
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,079
meaningfully whereas

1572
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,760
things that aren't being paid attention

1573
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,920
to in the sense of precision waiting

1574
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,160
are the sensory inputs that don't make a

1575
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,760
difference for your deep priors

1576
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,160
so i'm not paying attention to how my

1577
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,440
sock feels in my

1578
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,240
shoe until i am but i'm not paying

1579
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,920
attention to it in the sense that

1580
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,799
the precision weighting is very uh low

1581
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,040
even though it's a valid sensory input

1582
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,359
it's just the the attention being paid

1583
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,440
to that stimuli is low

1584
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,400
but the value of that information about

1585
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,359
the foot

1586
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,680
can also be thought of as relatively low

1587
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
within this epistemic value

1588
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,160
sense of attention so if someone says

1589
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,119
pay attention

1590
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,760
fifty percent of this is like that it's

1591
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,799
like saying

1592
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,280
this is an important piece of knowledge

1593
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,359
so yes you also need to have the

1594
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,400
epistemic

1595
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,640
uh content it's not just enough to get

1596
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,000
the jpeg across

1597
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
completely or to have somebody hear your

1598
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
words there's this

1599
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,160
epistemic value to certain things that

1600
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,040
are said

1601
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,640
and a way that this is related to

1602
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,119
ostensive cues is just with the

1603
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,280
simple phrase hey pay attention or

1604
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,160
listen up

1605
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,280
the next thing i'm going to say is

1606
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,680
important these are broad

1607
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,680
ways that are they're ascentive cues

1608
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,720
they're demonstrated

1609
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,280
cues that people can use linguistically

1610
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,680
or non-linguistically like waving or

1611
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,799
things like that

1612
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,359
these are cues that say hey if you can

1613
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,559
make out this signal

1614
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,040
if you can hear my sos if you can see me

1615
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,079
waving

1616
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,240
then please pay attention because this

1617
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,599
next thing i'm about to convey

1618
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,720
is not just uh syntactically important

1619
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,240
but it's actually epistemically

1620
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,720
important

1621
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,520
thoughts on this

1622
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,119
uh yeah it seems interesting because

1623
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,799
when i uh read this paper i also use a

1624
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:07,520
red

1625
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,839
highlight to this part about folk

1626
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,359
differences between folk psychology term

1627
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,760
and because usually i use yellow and for

1628
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,880
this part

1629
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,200
i decided to use red one because it's

1630
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,040
really it looks like

1631
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,359
very important for communication and

1632
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,960
understanding it

1633
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,400
and as we know from

1634
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,520
figures and from this paper about

1635
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,559
regimes of attention what

1636
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,000
which are very important to have

1637
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,559
to really have generation and

1638
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,400
synchronization

1639
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,520
of mental states uh so and if you want

1640
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,160
to speak

1641
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,520
about uh just how this to set up

1642
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,440
this regime of attention and maybe

1643
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,160
as it usually usually discussed in

1644
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,359
psychology like

1645
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,480
how to train attention and

1646
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,079
to manage attention uh we should

1647
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,960
to see this difference because between

1648
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,640
epistemic

1649
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,119
part and this precision weighting

1650
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,480
very nice and so if we

1651
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,839
uh how it could related to ostensive

1652
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,080
cues

1653
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,720
[Music]

1654
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,160
i think about i don't know how is a

1655
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,079
concept

1656
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,599
about attention governance so some kind

1657
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,400
of

1658
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,839
rules to manage attention and some kind

1659
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:38,400
of

1660
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,000
proofs which ostensive cues is

1661
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,200
really important and which one ones is

1662
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,359
not important or maybe wrong for example

1663
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,119
yep and special uh signs that say hey i

1664
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,599
didn't

1665
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,520
hear what you said you lagged out could

1666
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,119
you repeat that i needed i needed

1667
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,680
more precision waiting on what you said

1668
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,119
because i couldn't even get to your

1669
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,040
epistemic content and then

1670
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,280
oh wait i heard you on what the name was

1671
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
i just i don't know who that author is

1672
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,440
so that's the epistemic level or okay i

1673
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,400
know that author

1674
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,000
but i still don't understand how this is

1675
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,760
fitting into the narrative of why we're

1676
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,119
in this conversation

1677
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,720
it's another level saying i got you

1678
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,960
epistemically but now narratively i'm a

1679
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,000
bit lost

1680
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
and so these are different levels that

1681
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,359
could be quantified

1682
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,520
and could be formalized and de-risked as

1683
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,799
well

1684
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,480
um anything else go ahead sasha

1685
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,880
yeah another thing to add about

1686
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,400
ostensive cues

1687
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,559
i think this answers the one of the

1688
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,520
questions

1689
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,599
posed in the paper which is how might an

1690
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,960
individual recognize

1691
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,440
another's intention to generate an

1692
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,720
active communication

1693
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,079
intended for oneself in the first place

1694
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,000
and um that was another question that i

1695
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,040
had written out as

1696
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,000
as interesting and it seems like kind of

1697
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
comes back full circle to answer it

1698
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,039
that um ostensive cues are

1699
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,400
a way to let our

1700
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,079
to let other people know that we're

1701
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,520
intending to communicate with them

1702
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,440
in a more um multi-level way

1703
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,359
like to focus their attention first

1704
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,839
before we communicate the uh

1705
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,400
important information and then to the

1706
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,119
point about

1707
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,799
uh rules of attention at least from

1708
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,680
a neuroscience background which i think

1709
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,720
shies away

1710
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,240
a bit from understanding the

1711
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,480
psychology of the human experience and

1712
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
tries to have a more deflationary

1713
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,920
account of uh what's happening

1714
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,720
the rules i as i've heard them at least

1715
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,920
of attention

1716
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,960
um is to try to unpack and understand

1717
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,720
why a human is attending um

1718
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,319
to a certain stimulus or not

1719
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,880
versus how a human can modulate their

1720
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,760
attention

1721
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,839
so that they can better attend or um pay

1722
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,000
attention uh

1723
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,920
based on what they want to accomplish so

1724
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,559
it's a bit of internal versus um

1725
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,280
external perception of what human

1726
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:09,920
attention

1727
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,039
is so i like that point about

1728
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,839
the psychology perspective on this

1729
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,359
because

1730
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,440
ultimately that's a a bit more useful

1731
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,720
for um

1732
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,799
individuals making choices than to

1733
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,000
understand what's happening from the

1734
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,520
outside

1735
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,280
yep the precision psychiatry

1736
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,079
work fristen and babcock and others

1737
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,119
talks a lot about

1738
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,200
these aberrant precision errors and

1739
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,680
about how they result in decision making

1740
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,400
or experienced pathologies so in this

1741
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,119
last

1742
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,720
section i think we could actually even

1743
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,720
go one more level

1744
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,240
into this epistemic value topic

1745
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,319
and bring it to free energy so this is

1746
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,240
again about active inference as a

1747
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,440
process theory

1748
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,520
and we can see the minimal active

1749
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,440
inference loop here

1750
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,880
but i think this is going to be an

1751
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,280
opportunity for us to kind of go up

1752
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,559
the the chain another dimension which is

1753
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,079
to go from this active inference

1754
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,559
loop which is very qualitative and like

1755
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,359
the skeleton

1756
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,520
of action and let's look at a quote from

1757
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,720
the authors about

1758
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,359
where does free energy play into this so

1759
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,119
the authors write

1760
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,599
the free energy expected under a policy

1761
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,280
tracks the probability of that

1762
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,760
particular policy being pursued

1763
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,079
i.e of that specific policy being

1764
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,680
selected to guide action

1765
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,280
so it's kind of weird when people think

1766
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,119
well wait what is my brain doing

1767
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,240
inference on it's

1768
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,000
doing inference on the probability that

1769
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,599
right now i'm in a chair i mean don't i

1770
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,039
just know i'm in a chair or

1771
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,960
don't i just know that it's likely to be

1772
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,480
me in a chair in 20 minutes if that's

1773
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,920
where i want to be or not

1774
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,760
but no actually what's happening is the

1775
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,119
brain is doing inference

1776
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,200
on the probability of a policy being

1777
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,640
pursued

1778
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,520
relatively less expected free energy

1779
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,760
indicates a relatively more probable

1780
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,559
policy

1781
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,480
and this is seen sometimes not to go

1782
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,079
into too many details but when people

1783
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,079
take the log or the negative log

1784
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,480
of a probability it's just so that you

1785
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,160
can minimize a number

1786
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,079
and by getting closer to zero which is

1787
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,359
like a fixed number

1788
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,200
we can know that we're maximizing the

1789
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,640
probability so

1790
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,640
if we make it so that smaller numbers

1791
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,920
are more likely like

1792
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,640
one over the likelihood type thing then

1793
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,160
we can actually do a minimization

1794
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,799
problem

1795
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:23,280
going towards zero as a lower bound

1796
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,960
because some of these things being

1797
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,559
bounded by zero and then know that we're

1798
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,400
making more probable or better policy

1799
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,000
decisions by minimizing

1800
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
whereas if we were to do a maximization

1801
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,760
problem and just say well let's just

1802
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,839
maximize the overall likelihood

1803
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,079
there's no known upper bound for how

1804
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,039
optimal it could be

1805
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,640
so you might not know when to stop but

1806
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,240
minimization helps you because it kind

1807
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:42,559
of

1808
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,760
puts a hard stop on zero expected free

1809
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,400
energy

1810
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,720
can be decomposed into two terms so here

1811
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,000
we come back there's epistemic

1812
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,599
and there's going to be another one the

1813
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,599
two terms are epistemic value

1814
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,440
which is the information gain of an

1815
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,920
observation and pragmatic value

1816
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,240
which is the expected log evidence of an

1817
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,039
outcome

1818
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,280
given a generative model of how outcomes

1819
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,799
depend on action

1820
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,720
the relative influence of each term

1821
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,559
quantifies the degree to which a

1822
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,000
particular policy

1823
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,720
generates actions that explore the niche

1824
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,400
i.e exploration

1825
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,559
or actions that leverage reliable

1826
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,160
expectations about the niche

1827
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,319
to secure preferred outcomes i.e

1828
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,280
exploitation

1829
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,319
this is depicted in figure one so any

1830
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,079
thoughts on this or there's a lot more

1831
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,960
to say here

1832
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,400
one channel isn't going i was just going

1833
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,480
to say that explanation you gave for why

1834
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,880
it's a minimization problem um was

1835
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,960
really helpful like in a really lay

1836
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,760
sense of

1837
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,520
just that minimization is an easier

1838
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,760
computation that has a lower bound that

1839
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,160
was

1840
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,480
a really helpful explanation thanks alex

1841
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,039
i i just want to point uh one thing

1842
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:53,520
about

1843
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,400
what these terms of exploration and

1844
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,079
exploitation

1845
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,119
is also could be met in some literature

1846
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:01,839
about

1847
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,039
business strategies so it's possible

1848
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:05,760
ways to

1849
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,440
accompany and to choose

1850
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,640
direction to act on different stages and

1851
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,880
different states and

1852
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,000
you as it wrote it in this literature

1853
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,039
you should

1854
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,559
the company should first to

1855
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,280
explorate some your idea and the next

1856
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:25,680
step

1857
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,400
is exploration exploitation if there is

1858
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,200
some value

1859
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,160
for the company great and we'll come

1860
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,640
back

1861
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,119
to that in in just a second it's it's so

1862
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,440
true it's a lot like explore exploit in

1863
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:37,839
other

1864
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,880
domains and if you go too far onto one

1865
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,599
end

1866
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,839
it ends up being less than useful if

1867
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,160
it's purely exploratory

1868
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,319
ever exploiting anything then you never

1869
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,079
extract the value that would be like

1870
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,079
searching for where the oil is but never

1871
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,280
drilling and then

1872
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,799
on the other hand if you're just like

1873
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,559
wait there's oil right here i'm gonna

1874
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,280
exploit

1875
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,960
you're gonna find out that that well is

1876
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,799
going to run dry and you won't have put

1877
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:01,520
in enough

1878
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,880
research and development into

1879
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,559
exploration and so

1880
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,640
there's no simple answer as to whether

1881
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,720
it's better to be exploratory or

1882
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,880
exploitative at what level

1883
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,920
um that's what free energy is about and

1884
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,200
i thought this could be a good

1885
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,679
opportunity to actually connect

1886
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,839
what is free energy why is it called

1887
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,080
free energy if it's just the probability

1888
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,399
of a particular policy being pursued

1889
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,839
why don't we just call it the

1890
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,640
probability of a policy being pursued

1891
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,120
and to answer this i'm going to draw on

1892
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,640
a little bit of

1893
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,279
chemistry a little bit of statistical

1894
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,158
mechanics

1895
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,880
so the term free energy in the usage of

1896
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,600
fristen

1897
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,399
has less to do with the tesla sense of

1898
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,198
free energy

1899
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,600
like electricity for everybody and has

1900
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,040
more to do with this

1901
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,120
sense of gibbs free energy which is a

1902
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,120
thermodynamic characteristic

1903
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,839
and we can look at this equation the

1904
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,359
total gives free energy

1905
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,399
equals u minus ts plus pv and in

1906
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,520
chemical terms

1907
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,759
these do have physical interpretations

1908
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,920
like the absolute temperature in kelvin

1909
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,238
or the entropy measured in some other

1910
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,040
unit but

1911
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,279
the idea that i want to get across with

1912
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,399
this equation

1913
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,960
is just that you can partition you can

1914
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,880
have an expected free energy of some

1915
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,238
chemical reaction

1916
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,839
and that even though it's a total

1917
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,080
singular number it can be partitioned

1918
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,238
into for example the internal energy of

1919
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,520
the system chemically

1920
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,839
the temperature weighted final entropy

1921
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,520
of the system and the pressure weighted

1922
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,640
final volume

1923
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,560
let's look at how this plays out in

1924
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,839
chemistry

1925
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,040
so on the left on the top

1926
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,120
we have an exergonic reaction or a

1927
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,719
reaction where the delta

1928
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,839
g is below zero so it's a there's some

1929
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,040
big differences between

1930
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,198
gibbs free energy and frisk's conception

1931
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,560
not the least of which that

1932
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,319
free energy as it's being discussed

1933
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,399
previously it's bounded at zero

1934
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,719
but delta g gives free energy it

1935
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:53,920
actually works in a little bit different

1936
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,400
way where values that are below zero

1937
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
means that the reactants have more

1938
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,600
energy than the products

1939
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,360
so these are exothermic or heat

1940
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,960
releasing reactions

1941
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,440
and then conversely if the delta g is

1942
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,400
greater than zero

1943
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,920
that means that the reactants have to

1944
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,840
basically go uphill

1945
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,760
and so we can look at this reaction

1946
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,040
coordinate graph

1947
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,360
and whether you're going downhill

1948
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,080
overall

1949
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,480
on the left side or uphill overall like

1950
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,920
a non-spontaneous or

1951
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,400
endergonic reaction in both cases you

1952
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,600
need to come over this

1953
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,000
hump that's the activation energy

1954
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,719
barrier

1955
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,600
and that's why certain reactions happen

1956
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,800
at high temperature but they don't

1957
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,159
happen at low temperature

1958
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,239
it's like a ball that's right here but

1959
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,000
it doesn't have enough energy to get

1960
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,640
over the hill

1961
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,320
so it's like even though the candle is

1962
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,480
thermodynamically favored to burn

1963
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,239
otherwise it wouldn't burn it's not

1964
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,320
going to spontaneously combust because

1965
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
it doesn't have the activation energy to

1966
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,679
burn and then

1967
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,640
if you're going uphill anyway then it's

1968
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:50,880
an

1969
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,360
even higher hill to climb because really

1970
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,960
you have to climb up over

1971
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,960
your final end point and then drop back

1972
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,560
down in a way that's thermodynamically

1973
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,360
favored

1974
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,239
and so again it's kind of a metaphor at

1975
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,080
this point but there is math that we're

1976
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,679
just not going into

1977
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,480
we can look at this delta g partitioning

1978
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,280
of the system

1979
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,440
and again delta g doesn't capture

1980
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,960
everything about the system it doesn't

1981
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,199
mention the activation energy it doesn't

1982
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,600
mention

1983
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,679
other things about the stoichiometry of

1984
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,520
the reaction but it is something that

1985
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,800
can be partitioned

1986
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,560
and then similarly we can think about

1987
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,719
this expected free energy

1988
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,280
in the first instance and we just heard

1989
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,120
it discussed as being partitioned

1990
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,440
into two things the epistemic and the

1991
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,239
pragmatic

1992
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:36,000
value so the uh knowledge or exploratory

1993
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,040
value

1994
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,520
of a policy and then the pragmatic or

1995
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,719
the exploitative

1996
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,080
value of uh policy and then

1997
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,960
we can uh just directly link it to that

1998
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,360
uh

1999
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,920
language around explore and exploit as

2000
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,920
well as around uh divergent

2001
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,960
and convergent thinking so

2002
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,800
these are still a little bit

2003
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,400
metaphorical but

2004
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,920
i thought it would be interesting just

2005
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,159
to directly contrast

2006
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,120
the free energy from thermophysics

2007
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
basically and from chemistry

2008
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,320
and then note how this partitioning of

2009
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,120
expected free energy into multiple terms

2010
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,199
has a lot of carryover from

2011
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,159
chemistry and from physics any thoughts

2012
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:18,719
on this

2013
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,120
or we have more math that we can survey

2014
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,280
to

2015
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,080
cool let's just go back to this figure

2016
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,480
with

2017
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,560
the outline that we've looked at a lot

2018
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,520
and let's actually

2019
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,679
look at these equations and not to um

2020
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,920
derive them or to implement them but

2021
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,880
let's just look at

2022
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,120
what are these equations because we've

2023
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,400
talked a lot about how

2024
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,600
there's internal states and there's

2025
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
external states we've talked about how

2026
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,520
sensations are what enter the markov

2027
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,120
blanket and how actions

2028
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,280
guided by policy are what exit the

2029
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,480
markov blanket

2030
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,040
and so this is the minimal loop of

2031
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,440
embodied inactive cognition

2032
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,520
okay so where do we go from the

2033
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,960
qualitative theory

2034
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,760
of just saying hey ecological cognition

2035
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,520
means it's always this action

2036
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,520
embodied feedback loop how are we going

2037
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,280
to add a layer of math

2038
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,600
and move towards formalization of this

2039
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,199
so we can just

2040
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,199
look at the equations that are in each

2041
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,239
of these four

2042
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,360
categories and what we can see here is

2043
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,320
what action is doing is minimizing the

2044
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,040
agents bound on surprise

2045
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,520
and this equation again even though it

2046
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,040
could be expanded into

2047
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,719
larger formats later the two pieces

2048
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,360
are basically the complexity of the

2049
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,239
action

2050
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,120
and the expected accuracy you'll also

2051
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,640
note that there's a ton of things where

2052
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,520
it's like wait

2053
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,199
you're calculating the expected free

2054
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,320
energy not just the free energy itself

2055
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,679
and the reason for that is the actual

2056
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:50,719
values

2057
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,440
are inaccessible to the organism and so

2058
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,520
the computation or the inference that

2059
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,320
the organism

2060
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,040
is actually doing is like not where is

2061
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,080
my leg

2062
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,120
it's where do i expect my leg to be

2063
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,960
and that's the genesis of things like

2064
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,640
the ghost limb syndrome

2065
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,239
all these phenomena that don't quite

2066
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,120
make sense in a sensory relay paradigm

2067
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,040
if you make it about a second order

2068
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,480
expectation

2069
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,760
where do i expect to be now it's now

2070
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,640
casting

2071
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,800
and it turns out that where am i now how

2072
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,159
would you even know

2073
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,400
where you were but if you ask where do i

2074
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,440
expect to be

2075
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,520
and how confident am i about that

2076
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,719
expectation

2077
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,640
it turns out that is what gets good

2078
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,159
enough and does it in a really

2079
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,840
computationally attractive way

2080
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,920
so action is minimizing the agents bound

2081
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,960
on surprise

2082
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
by balancing or combining we won't go

2083
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,239
too much

2084
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,480
into detail there the expected

2085
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,920
complexity of the action

2086
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,320
versus the accuracy of the action and so

2087
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,920
one way to think about that is

2088
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,400
complex actions like playing the piano

2089
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,440
are difficult

2090
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,679
to perform unless there's a feeling that

2091
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,679
there's also going to be accuracy

2092
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,640
whereas very low complexity movements

2093
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,640
like flailing one's arms

2094
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,719
maybe are done without worrying too much

2095
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,800
about the accuracy of the motion

2096
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,960
and then on the perception in the

2097
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,640
internal state the yellow

2098
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,320
box we have the um the

2099
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,640
internal states are reflected by the the

2100
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,719
kl divergence which is the informational

2101
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:17,679
divergence

2102
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,000
between the priors and the posterior so

2103
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,800
that reflects

2104
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,360
how the worldview is being updated and

2105
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,159
then it's penalized by the surprisal

2106
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:29,920
and um yeah i just want to

2107
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,679
put it out there just there is a layer

2108
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,520
of mathematics and equations that go

2109
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,159
beyond

2110
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,640
the structure of active inference and

2111
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,159
then just these last two

2112
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,040
boxes before we kind of summarize and

2113
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,159
close out

2114
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,719
it it frames external states the niche

2115
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,640
construction of the external states

2116
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,760
as bounding the uh surprise

2117
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,320
and so again it looks this green box the

2118
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,480
equation with kl divergence minus the

2119
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,760
surprise

2120
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,120
it should remind you a lot of this

2121
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,880
yellow box which is also the kl

2122
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,960
divergence minus the surprise

2123
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,280
and that's because this system is

2124
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,080
actually

2125
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,000
symmetric with respect to whether the

2126
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,280
external states are

2127
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,120
the human or whether the external states

2128
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,320
are the world

2129
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,400
because in the end it's a bi-directional

2130
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,560
markov blanket with sense and action

2131
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,239
moving both directions

2132
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,199
and so it would be a little bit weird if

2133
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,120
depending on which system we decided was

2134
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,800
internal to the markov blanket

2135
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,400
it went one way and if we put the system

2136
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,400
on the other side it'd be the other way

2137
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,239
so this is the the work that's been

2138
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,600
built out in the

2139
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,400
variational ecology work of actual

2140
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,120
constant

2141
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,159
and others where it's realizing that

2142
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,400
hey the niche especially when it's just

2143
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,440
other agents

2144
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,040
it's actually like the markov blanket

2145
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,719
gives us this symmetry and so the

2146
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,480
internal state equations look a lot like

2147
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,239
the external state equations

2148
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,800
and then sensations minimize the agents

2149
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,000
bound on surprise

2150
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,239
and again this is complexity minus

2151
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,120
accuracy

2152
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,960
which looks a lot like the complexity

2153
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,520
minus accuracy in red of action

2154
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,159
because the senses coming in are the

2155
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,560
active states of the world and so

2156
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,640
similarly we we have this penalization

2157
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,800
of the complexity versus the accuracy of

2158
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,920
sensation

2159
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,000
and that should remind you of earlier

2160
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
when we were talking about the the value

2161
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,440
of communication

2162
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,080
if the input is garbled then the

2163
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,960
sensations

2164
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,640
um it's not even that they're surprising

2165
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,320
or not they're just not that useful for

2166
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:20,880
us

2167
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,800
and so there's a lot of parallels

2168
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,000
between the different

2169
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,480
states in this model um across the

2170
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,239
divide of the marcotte blanket as well

2171
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,840
as the two types of things that pierce

2172
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,199
through the markov blanket

2173
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:34,239
and so just first coat of paint to close

2174
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:34,640
out

2175
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,960
this discussion with a little bit of the

2176
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,520
math underlying the formalisms of active

2177
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,719
inference

2178
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,840
cool so any

2179
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,280
overall thoughts or

2180
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,920
just a comment on that last slide um i

2181
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,239
kind of braced myself for the equations

2182
01:17:58,239 --> 01:17:58,560
but

2183
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,719
i i think that's actually very useful to

2184
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:01,840
talk through them

2185
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,360
and you did a great job

2186
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,679
really drawing those parallels out and i

2187
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,520
would actually love to see more of that

2188
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,199
in future discussions

2189
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,239
about linking the papers back to the

2190
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:15,120
equations

2191
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,440
in sort of these layman's terms

2192
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,400
cool well we'll definitely need

2193
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,640
assistance

2194
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,920
but it's good to try it's good to try

2195
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,159
it was also really nice that reef little

2196
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,440
um

2197
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,000
marriage of your action states are the

2198
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,600
world or the other agents

2199
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,960
sensory states and then their action

2200
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,840
states are your sensory states

2201
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,480
um which i mean it's shown in the

2202
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,360
pictures

2203
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,719
but sort of it's not always internalized

2204
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,400
that this is like super perspectival so

2205
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,760
it depends on

2206
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,880
from which um agent you're looking and

2207
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,159
it's also putting some

2208
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,880
agentive sort of characteristics on the

2209
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,320
world or the ego niche

2210
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,199
that you're interacting inside

2211
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,760
yep very nice it's really a fully

2212
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,560
relational

2213
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,040
theory because there's no objective

2214
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,640
internal states

2215
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,320
you can say well the internal states are

2216
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,080
internal to my epithelium

2217
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,400
it's like okay you can choose that as

2218
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,320
your system of interest from an

2219
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,159
engineering perspective you can choose

2220
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,400
that to be the bounds of your markov

2221
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,480
blanket if you define it appropriately

2222
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,159
but there's no way that you're going to

2223
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,480
be able to say that that's unambiguously

2224
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,960
the singular system of analysis it's

2225
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,360
just markov blankets all the way down

2226
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,040
and then when you think about um let's

2227
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,480
say contact improv

2228
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,120
or turn taking and conversation in both

2229
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,159
of these cases

2230
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,920
there's the whole world but we can kind

2231
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,520
of zoom in on these the dyad that's

2232
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,560
interacting

2233
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,640
and then you're right for them the

2234
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,000
external state

2235
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,840
is being the generative part of the

2236
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,600
external state is like the other person

2237
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,719
and that's what's generating the

2238
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,880
coordination between the two arms

2239
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,800
from which you're receiving sensory

2240
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,920
input from

2241
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,040
and so one person is doing inference on

2242
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,199
the sensory state of another and this

2243
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:08,960
kind of ties us back to this idea of

2244
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,400
alignment of mental states

2245
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,239
so maybe let's look at one of the um

2246
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,760
figures here we are in the world

2247
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,679
and so yes it could be that two people

2248
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,440
are paying attention to the same

2249
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,679
world so here's like one person writes

2250
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:24,960
on the whiteboard

2251
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,199
and that contributes to changing the

2252
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:28,560
informational niche

2253
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,840
this person sees what's on the

2254
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,760
whiteboard they think ah what did they

2255
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,000
mean

2256
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,840
by this they add something new to the

2257
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,360
whiteboard or they say something

2258
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,560
that contributes to the niche and you

2259
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,880
get this infinity loop um

2260
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,280
or you can actually almost cut out the

2261
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,520
middleman here and just

2262
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,280
fuse those two parts you have two

2263
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,280
individuals and one person's action

2264
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,080
states are

2265
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,000
received as sensory information by the

2266
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,920
other person and that's why the

2267
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,679
alignment of mental state is

2268
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,000
so important because we can't just align

2269
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,040
people on

2270
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,199
each syllable by syllable we have to

2271
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,800
align people on semantic

2272
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,960
content of what is being conveyed and

2273
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,159
then even higher

2274
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,840
we have to align people to really a

2275
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,280
narrative understanding of what's

2276
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:07,920
happening

2277
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,360
because there's never going to be enough

2278
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,080
time to um convey all those micro state

2279
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,120
details

2280
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,400
and that's why this is so cool to see

2281
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,000
that the mathematics reflects that

2282
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,800
symmetry

2283
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
and the symmetry is what allows us to be

2284
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,840
fully relational

2285
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,000
without taking an absolutist perspective

2286
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,080
on what the correct system of analysis

2287
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,760
is for communication so communication is

2288
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,400
fully

2289
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,400
um relational it's all about those edges

2290
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,440
between nodes

2291
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,120
and then now we have this mathematical

2292
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,960
framework where we can

2293
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,960
talk about the nodes and edges in a way

2294
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,000
that gives them

2295
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,840
their due

2296
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,840
cool um any closing thoughts

2297
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,159
otherwise this was a super interesting

2298
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,320
conversation

2299
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,159
uh i just wanted to highlight again

2300
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:59,679
the importance of this description

2301
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:04,080
of attention in a more formal way

2302
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,520
and from perspective of active inference

2303
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,880
so as we see if

2304
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,120
this part of attention is important to

2305
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,280
communication and communication is

2306
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,960
important to alignment and

2307
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,679
it's a basement alignment of mental

2308
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,960
states

2309
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,199
so maybe for future discussion we need

2310
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,800
to unpack

2311
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,040
this part more deeply about attention

2312
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,520
great i think um it would be cool to

2313
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,159
look at

2314
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,560
perhaps a mathematical treatment of

2315
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,920
attention in a multi-level

2316
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,880
scheme and i think i know a good paper

2317
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,639
for that because i agree

2318
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,719
if the person isn't paying attention to

2319
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:47,679
the syntax

2320
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,920
if they can't hear the story they're not

2321
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,719
going to get it

2322
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,000
if they can't get the words they're not

2323
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,440
gonna get it if they can't get the

2324
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,239
narrative

2325
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,840
they're not gonna get it and and so or

2326
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,360
they're gonna get something but what it

2327
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,880
is that they get may not be what the

2328
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,159
speaker intends

2329
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:03,040
and so how do we formal model this and

2330
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,480
how can active inference

2331
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,480
help us cut through some of these

2332
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,679
complexities and

2333
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,159
simplify the whole system in a way that

2334
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,280
we could actually

2335
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,480
impact the systems that we want to

2336
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,199
impact by designing attention

2337
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,480
uh regimes um and culture in the way

2338
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,520
that we want to make it

2339
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,800
cool very great stuff everyone thanks so

2340
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,199
much

2341
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:29,040
for this follow-up active stream 3.5

2342
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,600
part two i think i'll try to find a way

2343
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,320
to

2344
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,520
fuse these two streams and

2345
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,360
we really appreciate everybody who's

2346
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,120
listening and providing us feedback

2347
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,679
and coming out to discuss with us so

2348
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:42,159
thank you

2349
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,679
everyone and i'm gonna terminate the

2350
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,880
live stream thank you
